It is a systematic literature review focusing on the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for crop yield prediction. The methodology involves synthesizing existing ML-based crop yield prediction papers, specifically selecting 50 ML-based papers and 30 deep learning-based papers. The evidence quality appears to be strong, given its systematic review approach. Limitations are not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, but systematic reviews are limited by the quality and scope of the included studies. The paper identifies commonly used features like temperature, rainfall, and soil type and algorithms like Neural Networks and CNN, supporting the application of ML in this domain.",
