It is a systematic literature review focusing on the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques for crop yield prediction. The methodology involves synthesizing existing research papers on ML-based crop yield prediction. The evidence quality is high, given that it's a systematic review summarizing findings from 50 ML-based papers and 30 deep learning-based papers. Limitations aren't explicitly stated in the excerpt, but systematic reviews are limited by the scope of papers included and the potential for bias in study selection and interpretation. The paper provides evidence supporting the claim by highlighting the widespread use of machine learning algorithms like Neural Networks and CNNs in crop yield prediction.",

The study uses machine learning to forecast crop yields at multiple spatial levels across Europe, evaluating its performance on 35 case studies encompassing nine countries and six crops. The methodology involves applying machine learning techniques to regional crop yield forecasting. The evidence quality is strong, as the study compares machine learning forecasts to trend forecasts, demonstrating that the former has lower errors and uncertainty. A limitation is that the forecasts captured spatial patterns well for average harvests but not extreme harvests. Overall, the paper provides empirical evidence supporting the claim that machine learning can enhance crop yield predictions, particularly at the regional level.",
