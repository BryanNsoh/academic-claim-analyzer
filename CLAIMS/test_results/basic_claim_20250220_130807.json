The methodology involves reviewing existing studies that use machine learning techniques for crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The evidence quality depends on the quality of the reviewed studies, which is not explicitly evaluated in this excerpt. Limitations are not detailed in this excerpt, but the review format provides an overview rather than in-depth analysis of individual methods. The direct relevance is high as it directly addresses the application of machine learning to improve crop yield predictions.",

The methodology involves comparing the performance of hybrid crop modeling and machine learning approaches. The evidence appears strong, with a quantitative analysis of prediction accuracy. Limitations are not explicitly stated in the excerpt, but the study focuses solely on the US Corn Belt, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The paper is directly relevant to the claim.",
