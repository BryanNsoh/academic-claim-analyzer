        "analysis": "This paper focuses on developing a mathematical framework called 'pangraphs' to model higher-order interactions within complex systems. While the paper does mention a 'real-world coffee agroecosystem' as an example, it primarily uses this example to demonstrate the application and advantages of the pangraph model in representing ecological relationships. The study doesn't directly address the impact of climate change on coffee production, but rather uses coffee agroecosystems to showcase the pangraph's ability to model complex ecological interactions. The quantitative aspect is present in the mathematical formulation of the pangraph, not in providing quantitative data related to climate change and coffee production. Therefore, regarding the research query, this paper has a low relevance despite mentioning coffee. It focuses on modeling ecological interactions, using coffee as an example, but does not provide data or analysis on the impact of climate change on coffee production, as requested by the user's ranking guidance.",

          "If a vertex modifies an interaction between two other vertices, then the three of them may have very asymmetric roles. It is indeed the case in a network model of a coffee agroecosystem [33, 34, 1]."

        "analysis": "This paper, \"Emergence of Fermi’s Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System,\" is not directly relevant to the research query \"Impact of climate change on coffee production.\" The paper is a theoretical study in the field of quantum physics, specifically concerning the observation and breakdown of Fermi's Golden Rule in a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-1/2 Fermi gas. The methodology involves experimental measurements of transition probabilities using radio-frequency fields and analysis of the system's dynamical response. The evidence is based on experimental data from ultracold gases. The paper's limitations lie in its focus on a highly controlled quantum system, which does not translate to the complexities of climate change and agricultural systems. Therefore, it lacks any direct relevance to the impact of climate change on coffee production, and it does not contain quantitative data or specific geographic regions related to agricultural production.",
