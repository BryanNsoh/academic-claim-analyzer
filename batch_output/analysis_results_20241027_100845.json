It maps a conversation \namong the authors that is intended to introduce core system dynamics concepts. The causal map \nis presented for illustrative purposes only. It will be refined over the course of the next several \nyears through a project recently funded by the USDA Forest Service titled, “Integrating the Grey \nand the Green to Improve Health and Well-Being for Urban Populations” (Research Joint \nVenture Agreement, #12-JV-11242309-095). \n \n \nThroughout the history of cities, a wide range of social actors has competed over urban land as a \nscarce resource (Svendsen 2009). Regrettably, grey infrastructure (e.g., streets and sewers) has \ntoo often been positioned as being at odds with green infrastructure (e.g., parks and open spaces), \ninstead of the two being conceived of as mutually beneficial (Svendsen 2011). While there is \nincreasing recognition that cities are ecosystems with interacting human, structural, and \necological components (McDonnell and Pickett 1993; Machlis et al. 1997; Vibrant Cities & \nUrban Forests Task Force 2011), to date it has been difficult to communicate regarding how the \ninvolved elements relate to one another, much less decide how best to intervene to obtain desired \noutcomes. The purpose of this paper is to use system dynamics to visualize and explore the \ncomplex and dynamic relationships between grey and green infrastructure, and the benefits of \ntheir integration on the health and well-being of urban populations. \n \nAs a vital component of green infrastructure in cities, community gardens are exceptional \nin their ability to address an array of public health and livability issues across the lifespan (Twiss \net al. 2003). While they began more than a hundred years ago at the turn of the twentieth century \n(Lawson 2005), they are especially important during times of war, economic crisis, and food \nshortages (Helphand 2006). For example, during the Great Depression, city lands were made \navailable to the unemployed and impoverished by the Work Projects Administration (WPA), \nwith nearly 5000 gardens on 700 acres cultivated in New York City alone (Hynes 1996 as cited \nin Armstrong 2000). Today, community gardens are viewed as beneficial to participants by \nproviding them with opportunities to be actively involved in decision-making about the \ndevelopment and use of urban space (Stone 2009). \n \nSYSTEMS SCIENCE \n \nA systems science approach may inform healthy cities and sustainable urban agriculture \ninitiatives by providing mechanisms for modeling complex, dynamic problems (Northridge and \nFreeman 2011; Metcalf and Widener 2011). In particular, system dynamics is concerned with the \nidentification and modeling of feedback relationships that characterize a particular problem, \nincluding inherent delays (Forrester 1961; Sterman 2000). By linking the structure of complex \nsystems to their behavior over time, system dynamics modeling helps interested parties and \ndecision makers assess the impact of different interventions in both the short-term and the long-\nterm (Metcalf et al. 2011). \n \nMoreover, because it is a methodology that is conducive to interdisciplinary work and an \ninherently iterative process, the construction of a system dynamics model provides an \nopportunity for input from a variety of stakeholders, which may be especially important in \n1\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nunderstanding the relationships between community gardens and human health and well-being. \nAfter jointly articulating the problem, a causal map is drawn to visualize feedback relationships \namong the relevant factors that shape system behavior over time (Metcalf et al. 2011). Such a \nrepresentation constitutes a dynamic hypothesis of plausible relationships that may be tested with \na formal computer model, often after undergoing significant revision through either a \nparticipatory or group modeling process (Metcalf et al. 2010; van den Belt, 2004). For \ncommunity groups and practitioners who lack the resources needed to quantify and calibrate a \nsimulation model, or who aim primarily to reflect group knowledge using visual iconography, \nthe construction of a causal map may be a worthwhile goal in and of itself (Ford 2009). The \nderived causal map then becomes a boundary object that facilitates team communication about \nproject scope and underlying assumptions (Star and Griesemer 1989), and may be utilized in \ncommunity visioning and strategic planning processes (Twiss et al. 2003).  \n \nAn orientation to the causal mapping process is called systems thinking (Senge 1990; \nMeadows 2008) or feedback thought (Richardson 1991), a necessary skill in system dynamics \nmodeling. In order to introduce key concepts, a systems perspective is employed in this article to \nframe the problem of community concern around the high prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nunderserved urban neighborhoods. \n \nCAUSAL DYNAMICS \n \nThe etiology of asthma is complex and multi-factorial, including both genetic and environmental \ninfluences (Brisbon et al. 2005). It is currently the most common chronic disease of childhood in \nthe United States and the primary reason for school absenteeism, and disproportionately burdens \nmany socioeconomically disadvantaged urban communities (Gold and Wright 2005). \nExplanations for this health inequity include poverty, variations in environmental exposures, and \ndifferential access to medical care; reducing the burden of asthma requires efforts to address the \nunderlying social justice conditions that produce this health inequity (Greenwood et al. 2011). \n \n The hypothesized causal dynamics involved in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods are mapped in Figure 1, with a focus on \ncommunity concern for asthma as a motivating factor for both grey and green infrastructure \ninterventions. \n \n2\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\n \nFigure 1. Causal dynamics of asthma \narrows indicate positive polarity. Dotted arrows indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. \nHatched arrows indicate a delay, or time lag, to allow for resulting shifts in behavior and activity.\n \nThe causal map in Figure 1 makes explicit features of conversations among the authors \nregarding the complex and dynamic relationships involved in the case of asthma. This causal \nmap was constructed by co-author Sara S. Metcalf and revised with feedback from the other \nauthors. Note that the causal map uses solid arrows to indicate positive polarity, and dotted \narrows to indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. Positive\nincrease in the cause results in an increase in the effect, whereas negative polarity indicates that \nan increase in the cause results in a decrease in the effect. These links combine to create a set of \nreinforcing and counteracting feedback loops, as discussed in the sections that follow. While \nmany of the transitions outlined in Figure 1 involve implicit delays, the hatched arrows from \n“community concern for asthma” to “mass transit improvement” and “local asthma clinics” \nsignify delays that are substantially longer than other delays in the system. Explicit recognition \nof these time lags is necessary to allow for resulting shifts in behaviors and activities. This causal \nmap is a representation of the authors' shared understanding\ngreen infrastructure on urban health issues such as asthma. As this modeling effort continues, \ncertain unintended consequences of proposed interventions may challenge these initial \nhypotheses and thus require further analys\n \nGREY INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS\n \nGrey infrastructure has been defined as conventional storage structures (reservoirs, detention \nponds) and conveyances (pipes, canals) used to manage drinking, sewer, or storm water, usually \nin socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods\n polarity signifies that an \n about the influence of grey and \nis. \n \n \n. Solid \n \n3\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nconstructed of concrete or metal (Foster et al. 2011). It also includes streets, roads, bridges, and \nbuildings that do not incorporate technologies intended to achieve environmental goals (Foster et \nal. 2011). At the bottom of Figure 1 are two balancing or counteracting loops. For the sake of \nillustration, assume that mass transit improvements and local asthma clinics are part of the grey \ninfrastructure of a community, even as it may be possible to incorporate natural vegetation and \ninnovative grey materials such as permeable pavements and white roofs into these interventions \n(Foster et al. 2011). \n \nIn the outermost counteracting loop at the bottom right of the causal map, community \nconcern for asthma leads to the construction of local asthma clinics, but this takes time, as \nindicated by the hatched arrow. Once the local asthma clinics are operating, however, the \nprevalence of asthma symptoms is decreased, as depicted by the dotted arrow. In the absence of \neducation and outreach on the importance of its mitigation, a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms could lead to less community concern for asthma, as depicted in the causal map. In \nother words, prevalence increases concern, and lower prevalence ultimately lowers concern. This \nwould tend toward cycles of increasing prevalence and concern, followed by mitigated \nprevalence, diminished concern, disinvestment, and a potential resurgence of asthma prevalence. \nA useful comparison would be a campaign against secondhand smoke, a trigger for asthma \nsymptoms: although the prevalence of smoking has declined, the campaign against secondhand \nsmoke remains quite strong. Without a secondhand smoke campaign, concern about smoking \nmight diminish, and smoking prevalence may again increase.  \n \nA second counteracting loop is triggered by community concern for asthma leading to \nmass transit improvement, although again it may take time for funds to be allocated and \nconstruction to be completed, as per the hatched arrow designation. To the extent that mass \ntransit is then more efficient to use than automobiles, traffic volume will decrease, as indicated \nby the dotted arrow. Lower traffic volume means improved air quality due to lower levels of \nrespiratory irritant pollutants such as ground level ozone and respirable particulate matter \n(Brisbon et al. 2005), as signified by a dotted (inverse) arrow in the causal map. In turn, \nimproved air quality leads to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms, once again denoted by a \ndotted arrow. Over time, the counteracting loop is completed when a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms eventually leads to less community concern for asthma, as before. In recognition of \nthis potential feedback mechanism, alternative interventions may be represented that would \nmitigate the diminishing of community concern for asthma as its prevalence declines. By \ndiagramming the underlying structure of these relationships, consequent behaviors and activities \nflowing from grey infrastructure investments may be explicitly articulated and constructively \ndebated. \n \nGREEN INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS \n \nGreen infrastructure encompasses the naturally occurring and human-built features that manage \nstorm water, remove pollutants, conserve energy, reduce erosion, and provide other ecological, \ncost-effective, and environmentally sustainable services (Vibrant Cities & Urban Forests Task \nForce 2011). Community concern for asthma may motivate individual volunteers, civic groups, \nand philanthropic donors to create green spaces centered on plants and waterways, leading to the \ncultivation of community gardens (Svendsen 2011). The bottom left of Figure 1 depicts a \n4\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nreinforcing feedback loop whereby community concern for asthma leads to the creation of green \nspaces, which in turn leads to the cultivation of community gardens, resulting in a stronger sense \nof community, which leads to renewed community concern for asthma. Note that green \ninfrastructure interventions may be deployed more rapidly than mass transit improvements or the \nconstruction of asthma clinics (i.e., there are no hatched arrows leading into or out of the \ncommunity gardens element in the causal map). \n \n In addition, the cultivation of community gardens leads to more opportunities for \ngardening, and eventually to more members of the community being involved in gardening \n(Figure 1). On the right-hand side of the causal map, there are two additional reinforcing \nfeedback loops. In the outermost loop, gardening leads to shared experience among community \nmembers and a stronger sense of community, which again results in renewed community concern \nfor asthma. In the adjacent interior loop, gardening leads to enhanced gardening skills, then in \nturn to more opportunities for gardening. According to Twiss et al. (2003), gardening workshops \nprovide opportunities for community members of all ages to develop skills in leadership, \ncommunity organizing, cultural competency, and program planning, implementation, and \nevaluation; gardening skills are enhanced through experiential learning, which includes \nintergenerational and peer-to-peer mentoring and train-the-trainer models. Ongoing, interactive \nlearning opportunities help to sustain momentum for gardening, which is effectively \ncommunicated via the reinforcing feedback loop in the causal map. \n \nHEALTH AND WELL-BEING DYNAMICS \n \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Health is a state of complete physical, \nmental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” (see \nhttps://apps.who.int/aboutwho/en/definition.html) While social well-being is included in the \nWHO definition of health, well-being includes multiple dimensions and is measured in a variety \nof ways in the scientific literature. For individuals, well-being may be understood as positive \naffect, life satisfaction, or simply happiness. For communities, well-being may be thought of as \nlivability, or shared experiences. \n \n A central reinforcing loop in Figure 1 is formed by the positive and reflexive relationship \nbetween health and well-being. For instance, enhanced well-being may lead to lower blood \npressure and less hypertension, resulting in fewer cardiovascular events (Shirai et al. 2009). On \nthe other hand, good health may foster engagement in social activities, including community \ngardening, thereby improving individual and community well-being (Armstrong 2000). For \nillustrative purposes, two pathways leading from community gardens are depicted in the causal \nmap, which are consonant with the research interests of the involved authors. The first pathway \nleads to well-being through sacredness, an interpretive act of ‘setting aside’ space for community \nor personal use that intertwines the sacred and the profane, and may include rituals, ceremony, \nand pilgrimage (Svendsen and Campbell 2010). The second pathway leads to improved nutrition \nand better health through the availability of fresh local produce (Metcalf and Widener 2011). \nNote also at the top of the causal map that gardening leads to increased physical activity, which \nin turn leads to better health, in concert with both the existing literature and the lived experiences \nof gardeners (Armstrong 2000; Wakefield et al. 2007).  \n \n5\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\n Systems dynamics modeling is also useful for understanding unanticipated effects. For \ninstance, while physical activity leads to enhanced health, it may also induce asthma symptoms \n(Parsons et al. 2011), as depicted in Figure 1. In general, though, better health leads to a lower \nprevalence of asthma symptoms, as denoted by the dotted arrow in the causal map. \n \nTeig et al. (2009) reported that the social organizational underpinnings of gardens give \nrise to a range of social processes, including social connectedness, reciprocity, mutual trust, \ncollective decision-making, civic engagement, and community building—all of which are part of \npathways leading to improved human health and well-being. Systems science modeling may be \nused to simulate social networks as well (Valente 2010), even as it will not be dealt with at \nlength in this article. \n \nWHOLE SYSTEMS \n \nAs exemplified by Figure 1, ongoing efforts to improve asthma in disadvantaged city \nneighborhoods may be meaningfully abetted by modeling that explicitly links grey and green \ninfrastructure. An integrative, complex systems perspective helps to identify interventions as \nleverage points that impact interconnected components and domains. Through the process of \narticulating causal relationships between elements, community members and social scientists \nengage in a participatory process of knowledge sharing to develop a joint sense of how resources \nought to be allocated to improve the health and well-being of urban populations and promote \nsocial justice and health equity. As illustrated in the causal map, two counteracting loops are \ninduced with grey infrastructure interventions (mass transit improvements and establishment of \nlocal asthma clinics), which also incur meaningful investment and inherent delays.  \n \nOn the other hand, the causal map is valuable in identifying a series of reinforcing loops \nthat is induced with green infrastructure interventions. In other words, planting a community \ngarden may not be the most direct response to addressing the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, even as it leads to the availability of fresh produce and improved \nnutrition and engenders a sense of community and sacredness, which are linked in turn to health \nand well-being. \n \nWhile virtuous cycles were emphasized earlier in this article related to the preservation of \ngreen spaces and the creation of community gardens, they might become vicious cycles if \nenvironmentally sustainable city planning is not enforced, economic policies fail to consider the \nshort-term and long-term benefits of urban forests, and incentives that curtailBris sprawl and \nencourage biodiversity are not enacted (Brown and Jameton 2000). The reinforcing nature of the \nfeedback loops indicates their capacity to destabilize the ecosystem. To counter this tendency, a \nsystems perspective underscores the value of coordinated interventions that integrate grey and \ngreen infrastructure, to guide decisions that provide urban populations with environmental, \neconomic, social, and health benefits, and build resilience in social-ecological systems (Olsson et \nal. 2004). \n \n \n \n \n6\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nLITERATURE CITED \n \nArmstrong, D.

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig. Yes N(%) No N(%) Don’t know N(%) Practicing daily social interaction in the pocket parks and nearby open spaces Yes (N) 41 (13.4%) 3 (0.9%) 1 (0.3%) 45 (14.7%) 0.000** No (N) 17 (5.5%) 226 (73.8%) 7 (2.2%) 250 (81.7%)  Don’t know (N) 1 (0.3%) 5 (1.6%) 3 (0.9%) 9 (2.9%)   Total 59 (19.3%) 234 (76.4%) 11 (3.6%) 304 (99.3%)  *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01 using ANOVA Test  One-way ANOVA test used to test the association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor (dependent variable) and the availability of efficient small (pocket) parks in the neighborhoods where respondents lived (independent variable). One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

Introduction In the tapestry of modern urban landscapes, a captivating transformation is unfolding—one that seeks to reconnect the bustling cityscapes with the restorative embrace of nature. This                                           Vol 13, Issue 9, (2023) E-ISSN: 2222-6990   To Link this Article: http://dx.doi.org/10.6007/IJARBSS/v13-i9/18299        DOI:10.6007/IJARBSS/v13-i9/18299 Published Date: 17 September 2023   INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1697  metamorphosis, driven by a growing recognition of the profound benefits that urban nature bestows upon inhabitants, has ignited a fervent exploration into the interplay between urban environments and the natural world. As concrete and steel rise to new heights, so does the aspiration to integrate nature seamlessly into the urban fabric, heralding an era where the presence of green spaces, biodiversity, and natural elements becomes not just a luxury, but a fundamental necessity for human wellbeing, environmental sustainability, and resilient urban design.  The concept of urban nature transcends mere aesthetics; it encapsulates the tangible and intangible connections between urban dwellers and the natural ecosystems that coexist within the city boundaries. These ecosystems manifest as parks, gardens, street trees, urban forests, wetlands, and even green roofs and vertical gardens. They bring a touch of wild serenity to the cacophony of city life, offering spaces for relaxation, recreation, contemplation, and communal gatherings. Beyond their recreational value, these urban green oases harbor numerous ecological services, including improved air quality, reduced heat island effects, stormwater management, carbon sequestration, and habitat provision for diverse species. As urbanization continues its relentless march, cities face multifaceted challenges ranging from environmental degradation and habitat loss to the physical and mental toll of urban living. It is within this context that the significance of urban nature takes center stage. A growing body of research underscores how exposure to nature within urban settings can have transformative impacts on human wellbeing. Studies reveal that spending time in green spaces can alleviate stress, reduce the risk of mental health disorders, enhance cognitive function, and foster a sense of connection to the natural world—an experience crucial for the psychological equilibrium of urban residents.  The benefits of urban nature extend beyond individual health to encompass the communal fabric of cities. Green spaces serve as hubs of social interaction, where people from diverse backgrounds converge, fostering a sense of community and shared identity. Parks and public gardens become platforms for cultural events, outdoor performances, and communal celebrations, knitting the urban populace into a cohesive tapestry of collective experiences. Moreover, urban nature acts as a leveler, bridging socioeconomic divides and offering equal access to revitalizing environments, regardless of one's background or means.  Biodiversity, too, finds its niche amidst the concrete jungle, enriching urban environments with a symphony of life. From resilient native plants to pollinators and small fauna, the presence of biodiversity enhances the stability and adaptive capacity of cities in the face of changing climates and other disruptions. Urban nature can also contribute to education, sparking curiosity and awareness among urban residents about the natural world. Educational programs, botanical gardens, and ecological displays become invaluable tools for cultivating environmental stewardship and sustainable mindsets in urban populations.  In parallel to these human-centric perspectives, the conservation of urban nature carries paramount ecological importance. Amidst urbanization's swift progression, native ecosystems are often overlooked or imperiled. Integrating nature into the urban fabric becomes a beacon of hope for preserving these ecosystems and safeguarding their intricate web of relationships. Such integration is vital for maintaining the resilience of cities in the face of climatic uncertainties and for upholding the ecological balance that sustains the urban environment.  This exploration into the relationship between urban nature and human flourishing stands at the intersection of design, ecology, sociology, and public health. It is a cross- INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1698  disciplinary endeavor that calls upon urban planners, architects, ecologists, psychologists, policymakers, and communities at large to collaborate in reimagining the urban landscape. From visionary city planning that integrates green corridors and wildlife habitats to architectural designs that harmonize with nature, the urban nature movement signifies a collective endeavor to weave the threads of nature back into the urban tapestry.  As we delve into this realm of exploration, this study embarks upon a journey to unravel the multifaceted dimensions of urban nature. By delving into the intricate relationships between urban ecosystems and human wellbeing, we seek to unearth insights that resonate with urban planners, policymakers, researchers, and advocates alike. Through a synthesis of empirical research, case studies, and theoretical frameworks, we aspire to contribute to a deeper understanding of how urban nature shapes the urban experience and, in turn, how cities can be designed to embrace and thrive upon the healing touch of the natural world. In doing so, we endeavor to illuminate a path toward more sustainable, livable, and harmonious urban futures that seamlessly blend the vitality of urban life with the resplendence of nature.

Forest A forest, as defined by its predominantly tree-covered expanse, stands as a testament to the intricate dance between nature's elements. These expansive landscapes play a pivotal role in shaping ecosystems, fostering biodiversity, and mitigating urban challenges. Urban forests, while often overshadowed by the concrete jungle, offer a myriad of benefits that extend beyond their aesthetic allure. This discussion critically delves into the multifaceted nature of urban forests, drawing insights from research to illuminate their role in urban environments. Keeler et al (2019) underscore the diverse contributions of urban forests, emphasizing their pivotal role in urban agriculture, riverine flood impact reduction, urban heat mitigation, coastal protection, and air quality enhancement. Urban agriculture, an emerging trend, finds fertile ground within the canopy of these forests, offering opportunities for community engagement, food production, and sustainable practices. Moreover, their capacity to mitigate riverine flood impacts by absorbing excess water contributes to urban resilience, curbing potential damage in times of heavy rainfall. The cooling effect of urban forests, a result of their role in heat extremes mitigation, is a scientific example of their environmental prowess. The phenomenon of transpiration, where trees release water vapor, effectively reduces surrounding temperatures. This process, validated by Hough (1989), is pivotal in countering the urban heat island effect, where built environments trap heat and elevate temperatures. Urban forests act as green saviors, offering pockets of respite amidst sweltering urban landscapes. Amidst the cacophony of urban life, urban forests emerge as natural sanctuaries that contribute to noise reduction. Bolund et al (1999) spotlight the pivotal role of soft ground and  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1712  vegetation in decreasing noise levels. The dense vegetation within forests provides a natural buffer, absorbing and diffusing sound waves. This acoustic benefit not only contributes to a more serene urban experience but also reflects the intricate balance between nature and urbanity. Microclimate regulation stands as another layer of the urban forest's contribution, backed by the process of transpiration. As Keeler et al (2019) highlight, the water released through transpiration has a cooling effect on the environment. Research by Hough (1989) reaffirms this process, elucidating how urban trees, with their transpiration prowess, effectively lower summer temperatures. This mechanism not only counteracts heat-induced discomfort but also bolsters urban planners' efforts to combat the adverse effects of climate change. The complex ecosystem of urban forests unveils a web of interdependencies, where each component plays a role in shaping the urban environment. Beyond their tangible benefits, these green expanses offer intangible but no less significant contributions to urban well-being. The tranquility that emanates from the rustling leaves, the visual respite they provide, and the sense of connection to nature all contribute to the mental and emotional well-being of urban inhabitants. Scientific studies indicate that exposure to natural environments, such as urban forests, is linked to reduced stress levels and improved mental health. Urban forests, with their rich tapestry of flora and fauna, offer a haven for those seeking solace from the pressures of urban life. As urbanization surges, the strategic integration of urban forests becomes essential. The research discussed here emphasizes the need to consider urban forests as multifunctional landscapes. Beyond their ecological significance, these spaces serve as avenues for recreation, cultural activities, and community bonding. The integration of amenities like walking trails, picnic spots, and educational centers within urban forests amplifies their role as communal spaces. Strategic planning must prioritize the preservation of existing urban forests and the establishment of new ones. Zoning regulations that protect green spaces and promote afforestation are instrumental in maintaining the delicate balance between built environments and natural havens. Collaborative efforts between urban planners, environmental experts, and local communities are pivotal in ensuring that urban forests remain resilient and responsive to evolving urban needs. Urban forests stand as a testament to the resilience of nature within urban landscapes. The critical exploration of their multifaceted contributions, as supported by scientific research, underscores their pivotal role in mitigating urban challenges and enhancing well-being.

Strategic urban planning that prioritizes the integration and preservation of these green expanses is essential for fostering livable, sustainable cities. The synergy between scientific insights and community engagement holds the key to nurturing these natural treasures and ensuring that they remain integral to the urban fabric. In a world where urbanization accelerates, urban forests offer a vital bridge between humanity and the natural world, contributing to a harmonious coexistence between the two.  Wetlands A wetland, a distinctive blend of water and terrestrial elements, serves as an ecological bridge between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Its unique hydrological characteristics and  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1713  biodiversity make wetlands vital components of natural landscapes. In this discourse, we delve into the intricate dynamics of wetlands within urban environments, exploring their role in water supply, stormwater and wastewater management, and their broader contributions to urban resilience. Defined as water-saturated areas, wetlands play an essential role in urban water supply and management. Keeler et al (2019) emphasize the significance of wetlands in ensuring access to clean and sustainable water sources. Rainwater harvesting, desalination plants, and water treatment facilities underscore the multifaceted nature of urban water supply systems. Wetlands, as natural reservoirs, play a pivotal role in replenishing groundwater levels, thus contributing to the longevity of water resources. Wetlands contribute to stormwater and wastewater management, offering a natural solution to the challenges of urban water runoff. The urban landscape, characterized by impervious surfaces, amplifies the risks of flooding during heavy rainfall. Bolund et al (1999) argue that wetlands serve as effective stormwater buffers, absorbing excess water and curbing the intensity of runoff. Furthermore, wetlands' role in decentralized wastewater treatment is a testament to their capacity to filter pollutants and purify water before it re-enters natural water bodies. The concept of wetlands as ecological filters gains prominence in urban contexts. Bolund et al (1999) highlight the role of wetlands in air filtration, an aspect often overlooked. Vegetation within wetlands absorbs pollutants, contributing to air quality improvement. Scientifically, the process of phytoremediation involves the use of plants to cleanse soil and water from contaminants. This phenomenon, adapted to urban wetlands, underscores their capacity to contribute to the holistic improvement of urban environments. A scientific example of this lies in the ability of certain wetland plant species to absorb heavy metals and toxins, mitigating their impact on surrounding ecosystems. This natural detoxification process not only enhances water quality but also underscores the intricate relationships between wetlands and broader environmental health. One of the remarkable roles of wetlands lies in their contribution to rainwater drainage. Bolund et al (1999) elucidate how wetlands act as porous sponges, absorbing rainwater and facilitating its gradual release. This mechanism stands in contrast to the rapid runoff typical of urban landscapes characterized by concrete and asphalt. The scientific principle at play here is the hydraulic conductivity of wetland soils, allowing them to absorb and transport water. Scientifically, studies have demonstrated the ability of wetlands to reduce the intensity and frequency of urban flooding. In urban planning, the integration of wetlands as natural stormwater management systems has gained traction. These wetland-based solutions, backed by research, offer effective alternatives to traditional stormwater infrastructure, curbing flood risks and enhancing urban resilience. The role of wetlands in sewage treatment holds profound significance. Bolund et al (1999) point to wetlands' capacity to slow down the flow of sewage water, allowing particles to settle out. This natural sedimentation process, facilitated by wetland vegetation, contributes to the purification of water bodies. Scientifically, the interaction between wetland plants and microbial communities leads to the breakdown of organic matter, further enhancing water quality. Wetland-based sewage treatment systems find scientific validation in their ability to remove pollutants through biological and physical processes. Phragmites australis, a wetland plant, has been studied for its ability to absorb nutrients and pollutants from wastewater, effectively contributing to water purification. The exploration of wetlands within urban environments reveals a tapestry of interrelated services that contribute to urban well-being and resilience. Beyond their  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1714  aesthetic allure, wetlands stand as formidable allies in water supply, stormwater management, and pollution reduction. Scientific research underscores the multifunctional nature of wetlands, validating their capacity to mitigate urban challenges and enhance environmental health. Strategic urban planning must consider the conservation and integration of wetlands within urban landscapes.

The scarcity of parks and natural environments in densely populated cities contributes to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and diminished well-being. Our project proposes developing rooftop parks and gardens to address these issues, transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. The project begins by identifying suitable rooftops for park and garden development. This involves assessing structural integrity, accessibility, and potential community needs. Once appropriate sites are identified, the project moves into the design and construction phase, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The resulting rooftop parks will provide relaxation, recreation, and social interaction spaces.  Community engagement is a critical component of this project. By involving residents from the outset, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and ensure that the rooftop parks meet the community's specific needs. Activities include: • Training local volunteers to maintain the green spaces. • Organizing events to promote awareness. • Creating community-led groups to manage the parks' ongoing maintenance. The benefits of rooftop parks are significant. These green spaces offer urban residents a much-needed escape from city life, providing areas for exercise, relaxation, and social gatherings. The project also seeks to raise awareness about environmental sustainability by integrating educational programs and community activities that promote eco-friendly practices.  The community-driven approach fosters social cohesion and resilience, encouraging collaboration among residents. By involving the community in every project stage, from planning to maintenance, we aim to create a long-lasting impact on urban health and well-being.  Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the quality of life for urban residents, strengthen community ties, and contribute to creating more resilient and sustainable cities. By providing accessible green spaces in urban settings, this project represents a crucial step in addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and its impact on public health and community well-being.    2  SECTION 3: DETAILED PROJECT INFORMATION  1. Problem Statement:  Urban environments often suffer from a significant lack of accessible green spaces, leading to numerous health risks and exacerbating broader humanitarian issues. This scarcity contributes to physical health concerns such as heat-related illnesses, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, it triggers a rise in mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and social isolation (Geary et al., 2023). The limited availability of green spaces restricts opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, which are essential for the well-being of urban residents. The broader impact of this problem extends beyond individual health, affecting community resilience and environmental sustainability. Green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating environmental risks, such as air pollution and the urban heat island effect. They also offer a natural refuge from the stresses of urban life, providing a setting where residents can engage in outdoor activities or simply unwind from the pressures of city living. Despite their importance, millions of people in densely populated cities worldwide face limited access to parks and other green areas, impacting their quality of life and contributing to social inequalities. Research in reputable journals like The Lancet and Environmental Health Perspectives has established a strong link between green spaces and reduced rates of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and various mental health disorders (Rojas-Rueda et al. , 2016). Green spaces can also positively influence children's cognitive development and improve the overall quality of urban environments. Furthermore, global initiatives like the World Health Organization's Urban Green Spaces and Health program emphasize the role of green spaces in promoting public health and environmental quality (World Health Organization,2016). The lack of accessible green spaces also has significant social implications. The unequal distribution of parks and recreational areas often leaves marginalized communities without access to these vital resources, reinforcing existing social disparities. This unequal access undermines environmental sustainability, as green spaces are critical for regulating temperatures, reducing pollution, and promoting biodiversity. The absence of green spaces diminishes environmental quality and increases cities' vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Moreover, the lack of green spaces contributes to increased social isolation, particularly among older adults and children. This issue disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where access to green spaces is often more limited. The result is a cycle of health, social, and environmental inequity that perpetuates itself over time. Addressing the shortage of green spaces in urban areas is crucial for promoting social justice, human rights, and sustainable development. It aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to health, sustainable cities, and climate action. A community-based approach to developing and preserving green spaces can contribute to social cohesion and strengthen urban resilience. It can also create new economic opportunities through community-led initiatives and support efforts to tackle climate change. By prioritizing equitable access to green spaces, cities can foster a sense of community and improve public health outcomes. Addressing this shortage allows for greater inclusivity, ensuring that all residents can 3  benefit from nature's physical, mental, and social advantages within urban settings. Ultimately, green spaces should be viewed not just as amenities but as essential components of a healthy and sustainable urban infrastructure. Addressing this issue holistically not only improves individual health outcomes but also builds stronger, more inclusive communities capable of withstanding socio-economic and environmental stressors.    2. Description of the Solution:  Rooftop parks and gardens offer an innovative solution to the growing problem of limited green spaces in urban areas. As cities become increasingly crowded, these green areas effectively use underutilized rooftop spaces, providing accessible nature and recreational areas within dense urban landscapes. This approach addresses several critical issues simultaneously, fostering environmental sustainability, enhancing social cohesion, and stimulating economic growth. The concept of rooftop parks and gardens is rooted in the efficient use of existing infrastructure, a critical consideration in cities where available land is scarce and development pressures are high. By repurposing rooftops, we can create green spaces that serve multiple functions, from improving air quality to providing community gathering spaces. This innovative approach reduces the need to acquire additional land for green spaces, allowing cities to maintain their density while offering residents much-needed areas for recreation and relaxation.  Environmental Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens contribute significantly to environmental sustainability. These green spaces act as \"green lungs\" within the concrete jungle, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They also help mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing natural cooling, which is crucial as global temperatures rise and cities become warmer. Rooftop greenery can reduce energy consumption by providing natural insulation, leading to lower heating and cooling costs for buildings. This, in turn, can reduce the overall carbon footprint of urban areas.  Additionally, rooftop parks and gardens contribute to improved water management in cities. They can act as natural rainwater catchment systems, reducing runoff and easing pressure on urban drainage systems. This helps to prevent flooding and promotes groundwater recharge, contributing to a more sustainable urban water cycle. Rooftop gardens can also support biodiversity by providing birds, insects, and other wildlife habitats in an otherwise sterile urban environment. This biodiversity aspect is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems within cities.  Social Benefits Beyond environmental sustainability, rooftop parks and gardens offer significant social benefits. Studies have shown that access to green spaces can improve mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. These spaces provide a respite from the noise and congestion of urban life, allowing residents to relax and connect with nature. Rooftop parks and gardens also serve as communal gathering spots, fostering social interaction and strengthening community bonds. These green spaces are precious in cities where social isolation is a growing concern. By creating environments that encourage people to come together, rooftop parks and gardens can help combat loneliness and promote a sense of belonging. They can also promote physical activity, as they offer spaces for exercise and recreation. This is particularly important in urban areas where traditional parks and open spaces are inaccessible. 4   Furthermore, rooftop parks and gardens can help bridge social divides by providing inclusive spaces where people from diverse backgrounds can meet and interact. This can foster greater understanding and tolerance among different groups, creating a more cohesive and harmonious urban community.  Economic Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens also offer significant economic benefits. They can enhance property values, making them an attractive feature for real estate development. A study by the National Association of Realtors found that proximity to parks and green spaces can increase property values by up to 20%. This increase in property values can increase cities' tax revenue, providing additional funding for public services and infrastructure.  Moreover, rooftop parks and gardens can create employment opportunities in construction and ongoing maintenance. This can stimulate local economies and provide landscaping, gardening, and park management jobs. These employment opportunities can be particularly beneficial in urban areas with high unemployment rates, offering a pathway for economic development and revitalization. Rooftop parks and gardens can also support local businesses by attracting visitors and encouraging foot traffic in urban areas. These green spaces can become popular destinations, drawing people from across the city and creating opportunities for retail and service businesses nearby. This can lead to a more vibrant urban economy and a higher quality of life for residents.  Theory of Change The theory of change underlying the adoption of rooftop parks and gardens revolves around their capacity to catalyze positive transformations across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By converting rooftops into green spaces, we can anticipate tangible improvements in air quality, urban heat island mitigation, and biodiversity conservation, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals.  Socially, these spaces can foster community cohesion, promote physical and mental well-being, and provide inclusive areas for recreational activities and social interaction. The sense of community that rooftop parks and gardens foster can strengthen urban resilience and support efforts to build more inclusive and equitable cities.  Rooftop parks and gardens offer a holistic solution to the problem of limited green spaces in urban areas by addressing environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and economic development. This innovative approach can lead to more resilient, inclusive, and livable cities that prioritize the well-being of their residents while promoting sustainable development goals.            5  3. Program Design and Implementation Plan:  The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program is a comprehensive initiative to enhance public health and well-being in urban areas by transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. This program addresses the growing issue of limited green spaces in cities, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. The overarching goal is to improve physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents by constructing rooftop parks, engaging communities through awareness programs, and providing educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The first step in implementing this program involves conducting a thorough needs assessment to identify rooftops suitable for development. This step includes extensive surveys and consultations with property owners, local authorities, and community stakeholders to ensure that the rooftops meet structural and safety requirements. The needs assessment also gauges community support and confirms regulatory compliance. By selecting appropriate rooftops, the program provides its efforts to align with local building codes and address potential risks. Once the suitable rooftops are identified, the program moves into the design and planning phase, which involves creating detailed architectural and landscaping blueprints. This phase emphasizes safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. Collaborating with urban planners and landscape architects, the designs incorporate elements that support the program's goals while enhancing the visual appeal of the urban landscape. Following the design phase, the construction of the rooftop parks and gardens begins. This step involves preparing the rooftops, installing safety features, and constructing green spaces according to the approved plans. The program establishes clear timelines and milestones for construction, allowing for efficient project management. To ensure the longevity of the rooftop parks, a comprehensive maintenance plan is developed, involving community volunteers and local organizations to maintain the green spaces. Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the program's success. The program organizes various events and awareness campaigns to encourage community participation and foster a sense of ownership. Volunteer opportunities are created for the upkeep of the rooftop parks, and educational workshops on gardening and environmental practices are offered to promote sustainable behavior. This community-focused approach helps integrate the rooftop parks into the urban culture, turning them into valued assets. To mitigate potential problems, the program implements several vital strategies. Diverse funding sources are secured to ensure financial stability, while close collaboration with local authorities helps navigate regulatory challenges. The program also uses weather-resistant materials and adjusts construction timelines to accommodate adverse weather conditions. Extensive community outreach and education efforts are made to reduce resistance and build strong support for the program. Robust evaluation metrics are established to monitor the program's progress and success. These include indicators such as reported stress levels, surface temperatures, and the number of completed rooftop projects. These metrics provide a clear framework for assessing the program's impact and allow for timely adjustments to address any challenges during implementation. The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program aims to significantly improve public health and well-being in urban areas through a well-thought-out program design and a comprehensive implementation plan. By engaging the community 6  and addressing potential risks, the program creates sustainable and accessible green spaces that contribute to the overall resilience and quality of life in urban environments.

        "abstract": "Urban gardens are popular green spaces that have the potential to provide essential ecosystem services, support human well-being, and at the same time foster biodiversity in cities. We investigated the impact of gardening activities on five soil functions and the relationship between plant (600 spp.) and soil fauna (earthworms: 18 spp., springtails: 39 spp.) in 85 urban gardens (170 sites) across the city of Zurich (Switzerland). Our results suggest that high plant diversity in gardens had a positive effect on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality, and that garden management intensity decreased plant diversity. Indices of biological activity in soil, such as organic and microbial carbon and bacterial abundance, showed a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Soil moisture and disturbance, driven by watering and tilling, were the driving forces structuring plant and soil fauna communities.

We investigated the impact of gardening activities on five soil functions and the relationship between plant (600 spp.) and soil fauna (earthworms: 18 spp., springtails: 39 spp.) in 85 urban gardens (170 sites) across the city of Zurich (Switzerland). Our results suggest that high plant diversity in gardens had a positive effect on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality, and that garden management intensity decreased plant diversity. Indices of biological activity in soil, such as organic and microbial carbon and bacterial abundance, showed a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Soil moisture and disturbance, driven by watering and tilling, were the driving forces structuring plant and soil fauna communities. Plant indicator values proved useful to assess soil fauna community structure, even in anthropogenic plant assemblages. We conclude that to enhance soil functions, gardeners should increase plant diversity, and lower management intensity. Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people.Maintaining functional and biodiverse urban green spaces is fundamental for liveable cities (cf. SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20. As a consequence of decades of beneficial soil management practices, such as the application of compost21, urban garden soils may not always 1Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Department of Soil Sciences, Ackerstrasse 113, 5070, Frick, CH, Switzerland. 2Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, Zürcherstrasse 111, 8903, Birmensdorf, CH, Switzerland. 3University of Neuchâtel, Institute of Biology, Functional Ecology Laboratory, Rue Emile-Argand 11, 2000, Neuchâtel, CH, Switzerland. 4ETHZ, Department of Environmental System Science, Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Universitaetstrasse 16, 8092, Zurich, CH, Switzerland. 5University of Konstanz, Department of Biology, Ecology, Universitätstrasse 10, 78464, Konstanz, DE, Germany.

A priori SEM model with hypothesised direct and indirect effects of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Expected positive relationships are given in black and negative ones in red, grey arrows represent both positive and negative effects. We expected that annual vegetables (arrows 1a) will negatively influence plant and soil fauna as well as soil multifunctionality compared to perennial grass sites, while perennial flowers (arrows 1b) will show positive effects. Management intensity (arrows 2) is expected to negatively affect plant diversity and soil fauna as well as soil multifunctionality. Higher plant diversity (arrows 3) is hypothesised to have a positive effect on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. Soil fauna diversity and biomass (arrows 4a & 4b) are also expected to have a positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Urbanisation (arrows 5) might have a positive or negative effect on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. Expected effects of soil characteristics (arrows 6) can be found in Fig. S9.3Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/be as poor in quality and potentially polluted as other urban soils3,22. Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2. Final most parsimonious SEM connecting garden management (land-use types, management intensity), urbanisation, plant and soil fauna diversity with soil multifunctionality (AICc = 288.3, Fisher’s C = 24.3, P = 0.93). Arrows represent unidirectional relationships among variables. Black arrows denote significantly (p < 0.05) positive and red arrows significantly negative relationships (Table 3). Dashed grey arrows represent non significant relationships (p > 0.05). The thickness of paths has been scaled based on the magnitude of the standardised regression coefficient. Conditional R2s, based on the variance of both the fixed and random effects, as well as marginal R2s, based on the fixed effect parts for each component models are given in the boxes of the response variables. Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

These issues negatively impact the sustainability of cities and human well-being. Urban life also causes physical diseases and chronic stress, leading to diseases and cancer (Kim and Jin\n2018\n). Urbanized citizens expect a high quality of life, including good public health, an unpolluted environment, good food, safe drinking water, and recreational opportunities in green spaces (Botkin and Beveridge\n1997\n). A liveable city must have green spaces to provide healthier surroundings and various benefits to urban dwellers. Studies show that living close to urban green spaces (UGS) leads to increased happiness and health, as they provide an ideal setting for unwinding from daily stress (Addas,\n2023\n). Urban planning and design face the challenge of meeting residents’ expectations, and UGS such as parks, gardens, plazas, and trees are essential in addressing this (Reyes-Riveros et al.\n2021\n). These areas offer comfortable living environments (Takano et al.\n2002\n), physical and emotional benefits (Grahn and Stigsdotter\n2010\n), and a positive association with perceived general health (Maas et al.\n2006\n). Research conducted in metropolitan cities like New York (Sutton and Anderson\n2016\n), Singapore (Henderson\n2013\n), Tokyo (Kohsaka and Okumura\n2014\n) and Delhi (Paul and Nagendra\n2017\n) highlights the importance of green spaces in regulating urban health, supporting biodiversity, and enhancing livelihood opportunities.\nPublic health indicators primarily focus on physical health, including stress, obesity, respiratory diseases, mortality, and life expectancy. UGS is crucial for physical activity and urban health protection (Wolch et al.\n2014\n). Green spaces have positive effects on mortality, CVD morbidity, cardiometabolic factors, mental health, low birth weight, physical activity, sleep quality, and urban crime (Yang et al.\n2021\n). Since the 1990s, there has been a rapid increase in public health and green space studies, with interdisciplinary categories emerging (Zhang et al.\n2020\n). However, studies on social health are sparse, despite the growing prominence of environmental disciplines.\nUrban planners, park administrators, and public health professionals can use green spaces to promote health equity (Rigolon et al.\n2021\n), but access to these spaces is often stratified based on income, ethnic-racial characteristics, age, gender, and disability. Research has shown links between green space accessibility indicators and positive health effects, such as a significant relation between the percentage of green space within a one-kilometer and three-kilometer radius and a protective effect against anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts (Maas et al.\n2006\n). Understanding these factors is crucial for achieving equality in urban spaces (Nutsford et al.\n2013\n).\nPolicymakers and researchers are working to address access issues in UGS to ensure environmental justice, public health, and physical activity. Three parameters of UGS development policies have been identified: proximity, park acres, and quality (Rigolon\n2016\n). Proximity refers to a geographic unit’s distance to the nearest parks (Talen\n2010\n), while park acres refer to the number or size of green space and recreational facilities that increase the total size of the UGS (Sister et al.\n2010\n). Quality encompasses the qualities, features, and fitness for purpose that impact how the populace uses and interacts with the UGS (Knobel et al.\n2021\n), aiming to improve the quality of UGS through improved service and maintenance levels (Rutt and Gulsrud\n2016\n).\nUGS management and planning in high-density urban areas require accurate information about these areas. Visitor perceptions are a common method used to measure UGS quality, which is crucial for effective management (Baur et al.\n2016\n). However, visitor perception of surrounding UGS is subjective and varies from person to person (Langemeyer et al.\n2015\n), influenced by factors like personality, location, socio-economic profile, scene composition, and complexity (Chen et al.\n2009\n). As a result, understanding the advantages and objective qualities of UGS is difficult, making it difficult to interpret perceptual data on UGS (Kothencz and Blaschke\n2017\n).\nAlthough a lot of studies have focused on many issues related to visitor perceptions (Basu and Nagendra\n2021\n; Chen et al.\n2009\n; Font et al.\n2021\n; Kothencz and Blaschke,\n2017\n; Paul and Nagendra,\n2017\n; Rupprecht et al.\n2015\n) of UGS, studies on visitor complaints are limited (Delshammar et al.\n2015\n). The handling of customer and visitor complaints can significantly impact satisfaction and loyalty levels, indicating the importance of evaluating organizational performance (Calin\n2012\n). Organizations can address complaints effectively by finding effective solutions and taking corrective action if necessary. Management should also prepare for positive feedback to boost visitor numbers (Fang et al.\n2016\n). Satisfaction can transform dissatisfied customers into satisfied and loyal ones, leading to revisiting, highlighting superior features, positive word-of-mouth, recommendations, and longer stays, particularly in UGS (Çevik\n2020\n). A satisfied park visitor is thought to increase the frequency of UGS visits and the time spent in these areas. In this context, the increase in the use of UGS in communities can make positive contributions to both individual and public health.\nDespite being the most densely populated metropolis in Türkiye, Istanbul has far less green space per person (7.6 m2) (İBBF\n2019\n) than the minimum level (9 m2) that the World Health Organization (\n2012\n) recommends for healthy cities. Under these circumstances, it is even more crucial to conduct research for a more effective and efficient use of the city’s green spaces. As a result, it will be possible to help design public policies that will increase the health and well-being of UGS visitors by revealing the complaints of UGS visitors about these areas. Therefore, aiming to explore the visitors’ complaints about the UGS in Istanbul, the research question of this study is “Which aspects of the nation gardens in Istanbul do visitors complain about?”\nMethodology\nResearch context and data collection\nAccording to the Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change (\n2022\n), Istanbul has 12 completed nation gardens projects, which aim to increase green space and meet recreational demands. Using Google Maps reviews as the primary source of data, the study focused on analyzing visitor complaints regarding these 12 nation gardens. Compared to surveys and interviews, online reviews offer a novel and efficient method for investigating visitors’ perspectives (Ye et al.\n2014\n). Further, research shows that 63.6% of internet users are likely to check Google Reviews before deciding to visit a particular destination, which makes Google the leading review site (Review Tracker\n2022\n). This implies that Google Maps user reviews can be a valuable data source to explore visitors’ perceptions of the nation gardens.\nGoogle Maps allows users to control who sees their public contributions, including reviews, photos, and ratings, which are automatically found on their profile and can be restricted by updating profile settings (Google Maps\n2024a\n). It also enables users to view and edit their public profile, which includes the ability to change their Google name, profile photo, add a short bio, manage account settings and privacy controls, find past contributions and posts, and review topic stats (Google Maps\n2024b\n). In adherence to Google Maps’ privacy policy and terms of service, the publicly available data was utilized for this study. Nevertheless, user names and locations were not revealed, prioritizing ethical considerations, including user privacy and anonymity.\nData screening and selection criteria\nA comprehensive dataset comprising 38,965 Google Maps user reviews was initially screened to identify visitor complaints about the 12 nation gardens in Istanbul. Then, to ensure the relevance and precision of the reviews, the following exclusion criteria were implemented:\n(1) Reviews containing questions only (e.g.,\n“What time does it close?”\n);\n(2) Positive reviews (e.g.,\n“One of the most beautiful scenery in Istanbul!”\n);\n(3) Neutral reviews (e.g.,\n“Barbecues and samovars are prohibited.”\n);\n(4) Non-specific visitor complaints; (e.g.,\n“I gave one star because I wanted to.”\n);\n(5) Rating-only reviews.\nReviews with five-star ratings were not excluded a priori, as some discrepancies between certain reviews and corresponding ratings were noticed. For instance, a visitor, despite giving a five-star rating, stated\n“Nice service but no maintenance! Most playground equipment is broken and not repaired. There is a security but it’s not active.”\nSimilarly, another visitor giving a five-star rating stated\n“I gave it five stars to stand out, but this place is worthless.”\nGiven such discrepancies, all visitor reviews with complaints ranging from a one-star rating to a five-star rating were included in the analysis.\nThematic analysis process\nAccording to the predetermined “criteria for inclusion/exclusion of online comments,” three researchers identified the comments to be included in the analysis, and all identified comments were coded separately by the three researchers involved in the study in two stages (Saldaña\n2015\n). In the primary coding, the data set was allowed to generate codes, while in the secondary coding, the codes obtained from the first coding were structured. This was followed by steps aimed at identifying patterns, connections, and common themes among the final codes. To do this, literature on UGS/park recreation was also reviewed. The full consensus among all researchers ensured that the themes emerging from each researcher’s coding took their final form (Miles et al.\n2019\n).\nFollowing the data screening, the final dataset comprised 4143 reviews specifically addressing complaints, forming the basis for the subsequent thematic analysis of visitor complaints. Each review was transferred to Excel, and 4143 were gathered in an Excel spreadsheet, which was then imported into MAXQDA software. Data analysis was performed using Braun and Clarke’s (\n2006\n) six-phased thematic analysis approach (Braun and Clarke\n2006\n). First, users’ reviews were actively read to become familiar with the data, thereby identifying possible meanings and patterns in the codes. Second, by organizing the data into meaningful groups, initial codes were generated. Third, by gathering different codes with shared meanings, whether they could be grouped under a common theme was identified. Thus, a set of candidate themes was constructed. Fourth, considering both coded data extracts and the entire data set, the candidate themes were reviewed and refined. Fifth, each theme was defined and named. In this phase, each theme was handled in relation to the other themes to ensure that there was not too much overlap between the themes. Also, to give the reader an immediate idea of what the theme was about, it was taken into account that the name of the theme was short and concise. Last, selected vivid and compelling extracts that captured the essence of the stories about the data were reported. Further, to support the qualitative findings about the prevalence of the themes in the data, the percentages and frequencies of the codes under each theme were calculated.\nResults\nIn total, 6135 coded data were extracted from the 4143 visitor complaints. 91 codes were then generated and gathered under five themes: outdoor areas/physical characteristics (28.4%), facilities (27.5%), visitors’ interactions (23.3%), accessibility/entrance management (11.9%), and restrictions and security implications (8.9%) (see Figs.\n1\nand\n2\n). The generated codes and themes were organized under the code system in MAXQDA and then visualized as shown in Fig.\n3\n.\nFig. 1\nDistributions of visitor complaints.\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nCode clouds.\nFull size image\nFig. 3\nVisitor Complaints.\nFull size image\nOutdoor areas/physical characteristics\nOutdoor areas/physical characteristics were the most frequently referenced theme by visitors. 17 codes were generated for this theme. Visitors’ primary complaints in this theme related to a lack of shade trees, a lack of outdoor benches, and poorly maintained outdoor areas. Visitors expressed their complaints as follows:\n“I don’t recommend going before sunset. It’s very difficult to find tree shade.”\n“Seating areas, such as benches, are insufficient. Many families including us had to sit on the ground.”\n“The area was so dirty and neglected that I was very surprised, it was the first time I saw a nation garden so bad… It was full of garbage in the forest areas.”\nOther common complaints included sloping ground that impeded movement and activities, as well as proximity to contaminated water sources which raised health concerns. Visitors also complained about the lack of shaded seating areas to protect them from sunlight and the lack of green spaces that spoil the natural atmosphere. Insufficient cleaning services in outdoor areas contributed to a less pleasant visiting experience. Visitors further mentioned that surrounding buildings, narrow outdoor areas, and the proximity to busy highways reduce the attractiveness of the nation gardens. Visitors additionally reported dissatisfaction with the lack of recreational event opportunities. Concerns such as inadequate direction signs, poor ground conditions, inadequate accessibility for people with mobility difficulties, and irregular lawn watering schedules were stated by the visitors. Windy weather conditions, inadequate landscape design, and the lack of hand-washing sinks all contributed to visitor unpleasantness. In addition, inconveniently located seats and a lack of litter bins affected the usability of the gardens.\nFacilities\nThe second theme was facilities. 33 codes were generated for this theme. Then, the theme was divided into three sub-themes: general facilities (16 codes), children’s playgrounds (8 codes), and physical activity and sports (9 codes). The primary complaints in general facilities were a lack of food and beverage facilities, poor toilet hygiene, and a lack of toilets. For this sub-theme, examples of the statements most frequently complained about by visitors are given below:\n“It doesn’t even have a place to get water. At least there could have been a vending machine or something.”\n“It is a very beautiful place but the toilets are in a terrible condition, they need to be taken care of. Although it is paid, it is not hygienic.”\n“There is a WC problem, it’s not enough. Additional public toilets required.”\nIn addition, many of the visitors found the prices for products and services excessive. Besides, some visitors expressed their concerns about the absence and poor hygiene of prayer rooms around, since they could not fulfill their religious duties. Visitors also mentioned being disappointed by the absence of designated barbecue areas and the unavailability of some facilities. Limited food options and poor service quality in food and beverage facilities were the other issues that contributed to dissatisfaction. The working hours and locations of the facilities were also questioned by the visitors. Charging entry fees for essential services such as toilets was considered inappropriate. Inadequate and impolite personnel at the facilities further worsened the overall experience. The absence of baby care rooms was also noted as a drawback by families visiting the gardens.\nInsufficient playgrounds, a lack of equipment variety, and poorly maintained equipment were the most observed complaints in the playgrounds sub-theme. Poorly located playgrounds, unsafe equipment, dysfunctional flooring, and uncleanliness made nation gardens less appealing to families with children. Besides, although uncommon, several adults monopolized children’s equipment by using the playgrounds, which caused safety concerns and discomfort both for children and parents. Some examples of the most frequently addressed complaints by visitors are given below:\n“There is a tiny playground in the big area, there could be more. Children are waiting in line to play.”\n“The playground for children is insufficient. It has a huge area but there are two swings. More different equipment could have been put, instead of ordinary swings and slides…”\n“The swings are about to break and must be repaired before an accident occurs.”\nThe most commonly reported complaints in the physical activities and sports sub-theme were a lack of a sufficient number of sports fields, poor condition of running/cycling paths, and a lack of rental bikes. Lack of running/cycling paths, poorly maintained sports fields, lack of sports equipment, user-unfriendly bike rental systems, poorly maintained rental bikes, and unsafe sports fields were also expressed by visitors as contributors to dissatisfaction by limiting their opportunities for physical activity and sports. Some examples of the most frequently reported complaints by visitors for this sub-theme are as follows:\n“…there is a volleyball net in the middle of the basketball court and when there are people who want to play both basketball and volleyball, the atmosphere gets a little too complicated.”\n“The running and walking path should be a tartan track. This is the first time I have seen a gravel running track. It definitely needs to be fixed.”\n“…but I have a small request, the number of bicycles is very small considering the area. It would be better if there were a little more.”\nVisitors’ interactions\nThe third theme was visitors’ interactions. Six codes were generated for this theme. Complaints from the visitors were mostly about overcrowding, too many foreign visitors, and visitors’ littering. Some examples of the visitor reviews are given below:\n“The only downside is that it is extremely crowded, you have to wait in line for everything. It is possible to wait for half an hour in the cafeteria or WC queue. My advice, especially on weekends and public holidays, do not come.”\n“I was so upset that I was wandering around :(as if I was in another country). There were very few Turks. It was like a city of Arabia or Syria. I don’t judge anyone, but in this case, it’s not normal at all, we became foreigners in our own country.”\n“There are litter bins everywhere, but unfortunately, it is too beautiful park for local and foreign visitors who throw the sunflower seed shells they eat on the grass and leave food on the rocks…”\nAdditionally, many visitors expressed their discomfort with the overwhelming smell of barbecue and samovar smoke. Moreover, the visibility of people who appeared threatening or frightening elevated visitors’ concerns and impaired their sense of personal safety. As well, visitors became irritated when they encountered others ignoring park rules, such as jumping across pedestrian or bicycle paths or behaving inappropriately in designated seating areas. Vandalism, disruptive noise from other visitors, intimacy between couples, and socio-cultural heterogeneity in shared spaces contributed to interpersonal conflicts. Besides, the prevalence of cigarette and hookah smoke, along with the presence of drinkers, exacerbated discomfort and health concerns among non-smoking visitors. Lastly, the presence of fast cyclists on the pedestrian paths drew complaints from visitors.\nAccessibility/Entrance management\nThe fourth theme was entrance management. Six codes were generated for this theme. Under this theme, the visitors mainly mentioned the busy parking area, parking fees, lack of entrance gates, and visiting hours. Visitors voiced their concerns about accessibility and entrance management in the following statements:\n“It is very nice and clean but the parking lot is very small, especially on weekends. Last weekend we made preparations for a picnic, we couldn’t find a place for the car, and we turned back.”\n“The parking lot has become paid. The nation garden should be used for the benefit of the public. I think twice about going because of the parking fee.”\n“It’s ridiculous that it closes at 10\npm, what’s 10\npm on a summer day? Just when it’s getting cooler, you hear the announcement that the park will close.”\nBesides, visitors expressed their frustration with the limited public transportation options to reach the nation gardens. Since the gardens were mostly located far from the city center, they were also difficult to reach on foot. Thus, visitors had few alternatives to reach the gardens other than by automobile or motorcycle. Visitors traveling by automobile or motorcycle were also dissatisfied with the long travel time caused by frequent traffic jams along the route. One of the complaints voiced by visitors was that the nation gardens were closed to visitors on Mondays. They stated that they would prefer the gardens to be accessible to visitors every day of the week.\nRestrictions and security implications\nThe last theme was restrictions and security implications. The main points of the 14 codes generated under this theme were no lightning at night, not being allowed to barbecue/use a samovar, and inadequate security measures. Some examples of the main visitor complaints are as follows:\n“When it gets dark, the lights don’t turn on and it gets pitch dark. I think the authorities should find a solution to this.”\n“Barbecue samovar is forbidden, people come here to picnic, this is not a playground.”\n“It has large and useful areas, but security is low. It needs to be more secure. The camera system should be more intense.”\nVisitors further criticized the way of implementing security measures, loud public announcements, a lack of security personnel, and their indifferent and rude behaviors. Visitor complaints involving pedestrianization in nation gardens differed. Some visitors complained that nation gardens were not pedestrian-friendly, while those who visited there by car or motorcycle complained about the motorized vehicle restrictions. Some of the nation gardens do not allow visitors to sit on the grass, which is deemed ridiculous and pointless by several visitors. The presence of stray dogs, pests, and mosquitoes in the area also affected the visitors’ satisfaction adversely.\nDiscussions\nVisitor satisfaction is directly linked to the positive or negative experience, as it relates to meeting needs or motives (Tian-Cole and Cromption\n2003\n). Negative experiences often lead to complaints (Bitner et al.\n1994\n). The study revealed that more than three-quarters of visitor complaints about urban green areas examined were due to outdoor areas/physical characteristics, facilities and visitor interactions. The primary complaint of the visitors of the nation garden is related to outdoor areas/physical characteristics. In past studies, it is seen that factors such as enjoying/being in nature (Andriotis\n2011\n; Sreetheran,\n2017\n), getting fresh air (Gashu et al.\n2020\n; Sreetheran\n2017\n), resting and viewing the scenery (Chiesura\n2004\n) come at the beginning of the motivations of UGS visitors to visit these areas. In addition, citizens living in metropolitan areas prefer high levels of greenery, more seats and large UGS (Lo and Jim\n2012\n). The study highlights a deficiency in Istanbul’s gardens, indicating a lack of natural and physical features that align with the fundamental motivations for visiting green spaces. Consequently, this inadequacy may have heightened the demand for green areas and raised expectations among urban residents. Addressing common complaints such as insufficient tree shade and outdoor seating could significantly enhance the capacity of these spaces to fulfill visitor expectations. Managers could address these concerns by taking into account such feedback and implementing necessary improvements.\nFacilities are a significant complaint subject, with complaints categorized into general facilities, children’s playgrounds, and physical activity and sports opportunities. The primary issue is the lack of food and beverage facilities, as well as inadequate toilet facilities and lack of maintenance. Considering that the success of a park depends on both supply and maintenance (Jibril and Elfartas\n2018\n) and that basic park amenities are necessary for visitors of all age groups (McCormack et al.\n2010\n), park planning and administration must ensure proper facility maintenance and provide amenities that meet visitor needs to improve the quality of life for urban dwellers. Another complaint theme identified in the study is related to playgrounds. Prior studies on UGS usage have revealed that taking kids outside is one of the main motivations for visiting (Irvine et al.\n2013\n). Many families go to playgrounds to be with their children or to keep their children physically active (Refshauge et al.\n2012\n). And these facilities offer chances for socializing, playing, and carrying out physical fitness activities (Qazi\n2011\n). Therefore, the presence and maintenance of playgrounds is crucial, especially for urban dwellers with children. The current study also found that visitors complained about lack of physical activity and sports opportunities. UGS is an important component in promoting physical activity, and these areas are one of the important quality indicators of these areas (Zhang et al.\n2022\n). Many studies show a strong relationship between UGS and physical activity. In addition to having specially designed facilities for sports, exercise and other strenuous activities, it also offers areas where people can run or walk (Cohen et al.\n2007\n), and is one of the most important motivational factors for city residents to use parks (Bedimo-Rung et al.\n2005\n). UGS visitors could be influenced by the design and condition of the facilities (Bedimo-Rung et al.\n2005\n). If visitors are not satisfied, the UGS may go underutilized or be abandoned (Ali and Nawawi\n2006\n). For this reason, the facilities offered by UGS should favor the people’s needs, demands, and preferences.\nThe “visitor interactions” was identified as an important complaint, highlighting the potential problems arising from encounters with crowds. Crowding research highlights its significant social impact on outdoor recreation and reveals that high human density can cause visitor stress in UGS (Arnberger and Eder\n2015\n). UGS visitors are motivated by the experience of silence and peace (Shan\n2014\n), and often avoid crowds to achieve this state of tranquility (Wan and Shen,\n2015\n). The research confirms the common issue of crowding in densely populated cities such as Istanbul, highlighting the need for effective solutions to address this issue. Another theme identified within the scope of visitor interactions was that there were too many foreign visitors in the areas. UGS and city parks are crucial for social integration, providing temporary leisure spaces for various ethnic groups, and fostering a sense of belonging (Stodolska et al.\n2017\n) and attachment (Neal et al.\n2015\n). However, encounters between different ethnic groups in these areas can lead to negative consequences. Dines et al. (\n2006\n) noted conflicts in neighborhood public spaces, particularly neighborhood parks, due to racial tension (Dines et al.\n2006\n). Madanipour (\n2010\n) highlighted problematic incidents involving minorities in Rotterdam, Netherlands, due to the city’s heavy use of public spaces (Madanipour\n2010\n). Istanbul, Türkiye’s largest city, is home to the highest number of immigrants, causing negative attitudes among locals (Doğan et al.\n2020\n). This attitude is believed to be reflected in park areas and affects study results. In this context, park managers should tailor park design and event programing to embrace diverse communities and encourage positive interactions.\nIn the current study, another complaint issue identified is related to accessibility and entrance management. In particular, inequalities in the accessibility and distribution of parks and green spaces are an issue that is gaining increasing attention. Some of the main areas of research have focused on identifying access levels and areas that lack accessibility (Wei\n2017\n). This situation is also shown as one of the important constraints on individuals’ use of parks and green areas (Rushing et al.\n2019\n). In this context, it is recommended that urban park planners seek strategies to increase the accessibility of urban parks to ensure that socio-cultural benefits are shared equitably (Talal and Santelmann\n2021\n). The last complaint theme identified in this current study is restrictions and security implications. Along with its many advantages, UGS has several disadvantages that are frequently disregarded (Maruthaveeran and van den Bosch\n2014\n). Numerous empirical investigations have indicated a direct correlation between decreased utilization of UGS and fear of crime. However, fear of park use due to perceived safety has been reported, especially among children and women (McCormick and Holland\n2015\n). Apart from this, the literature also investigates the physical characteristics such as landscape design, vegetation density, maintenance, physical incivility, amount of light, way-finding and legibility, and visibility of UGSs that may affect perceived safety (Mahrous et al.\n2018\n).\nThis exploratory study contributes to the extensive literature by determining the complaints of visitors of Istanbul nation gardens in these areas. In this study, five complaint themes were identified for these areas, and it was reported that three of these themes named outdoor areas/physical characteristics, facilities and visitor interactions constituted three-quarters of the complaints made. Apart from these themes, other factors such as accessibility and entrance management and the limitations and security implications of nation gardens appear to be factors that generate fewer complaints. Examining the codes that comprise these themes demonstrates that complaints regarding the crowd are prominent. In this context, especially in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul, where the amount of green space is limited, park planners can integrate the suggestions, expectations and needs of visitors in improving existing parks and designing new ones. The investigation of park visitors’ complaints could add a new social- and people-oriented dimension to refine design and management. In this way, by ensuring more effective use of UGS, individual and social benefits, such as health outcomes obtained from these areas, can be maximised.\nImplications\nThe analysis of visitor grievances and the ensuing application of remedies are critical to improving UGS. The study’s conclusions have several useful ramifications that apply to this situation. These suggestions provide concrete actions to resolve visitor issues and improve UGS quality. The development and administration of parks and green spaces may improve visitor satisfaction and the general quality of life in cities by using such doable measures.\nSeveral management implications have been suggested to improve UGS in light of the study’s findings. In order to enhance the physical characteristics and operational efficiency of outdoor areas, it is advised to increase the selection of sitting opportunities, such as picnic tables and benches, and to strategically place these facilities around the park. Expanding the number of trees in sitting and rest spaces can improve comfort on bright days by providing the shade that is needed. A nice and friendly atmosphere may also be maintained by enhancing maintenance and repair services and increasing the frequency of cleaning and waste collection.\nFurther recommendations focus on enhancing the overall visitor experience and accessibility. Ensuring the availability of clean, accessible toilets and establishing more facilities that offer diverse food and beverage options are critical for visitor satisfaction. Designing dedicated areas for children’s play and sports activities can cater to a broader audience and enhance recreational opportunities. Managing the number of visitors, particularly during peak times like weekends and holidays, will help prevent overcrowding. Additionally, for visitor management, practices can be implemented to help different ethnic groups communicate and understand each other by planning activities that will encourage cultural diversity and participation. Security can be improved by enhancing lighting, installing security cameras, and increasing patrols, which will also create a safer environment for activities such as barbecuing and picnicking. Extending the working hours of services provided at UGSs and increasing public transportation options would make these spaces more accessible and user-friendly.\nTo ensure sustainability in UGSs, it is imperative to establish a framework that incorporates residents into the system, in addition to implementing practical applications informed by research findings. In the current study by Nguyen and Jones (\n2022\n), it is suggested that the development of natural areas can be contributed by developing an eco-surplus culture among residents. This concept is a set of environmentally friendly attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviors shared by a group of people, aimed at reducing negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and protecting and restoring nature. Encouraging the cultivation of an eco-surplus culture has the potential to enhance city residents’ awareness and appreciation of biodiversity, conservation endeavors, and initiatives aimed at addressing environmental challenges within UGSs. This approach also facilitates UGSs’ role in educating visitors about environmental issues and potential solutions. Thus, urban residents have the opportunity to engage actively in environmental conservation and sustainability endeavors through such initiatives. Given this information, a comprehensive approach can be developed to protect and enhance green spaces in densely populated areas like Istanbul, where green space is limited. This approach may include nature education workshops, awareness programs, volunteer opportunities for community-based nature conservation efforts, organization of ecologically oriented recreational activities integrated with nature, and the implementation of environmentally sustainable green space designs. The increasing efforts by authorities to encourage the utilization of these areas will also enhance city residents’ contact with nature. Considering that contact with nature is deemed an effective means for constructing eco-surplus culture (Vuong and Nguyen\n2023\n), this situation can generate a cycle by fostering interaction. In this context, UGSs are believed to play a key role in the formation of eco-surplus culture within societies.\nBeyond the traditional establishment of environmental conservation culture, reshaping cultural values as proposed by Vuong (\n2021\n) to incorporate the value of environmental conservation may lead to the creation of an eleventh cultural value, fostering a long-term understanding of environmental preservation. Furthermore, this newly created cultural value introduces a novel concept of profitability measured by the degree of benefits derived from nature restoration and enhancement of sustainability conditions. In his study advocating for sustainable practices within business sectors, Vuong (\n2021\n) defines profitability as the sum of net environmental value and net monetary profit. This novel perspective on profitability could benefit from the adoption of a model in the management of urban green spaces in Istanbul, one that integrates environmental and social values into operational frameworks.\nFor instance, complaints regarding inadequate facilities and physical attributes of green spaces (such as lack of maintenance or insufficient natural features) could be addressed through the implementation of a semiconductor principle model. This would entail assessing the net environmental value (NEV), which includes contributions such as enhancing public health, reducing urban heat, and increasing social well-being, thereby addressing these spaces’ roles.\nUrban planners can ensure that investments in UGSs, whether through increased funding or public support, align with both the tangible and intangible benefits they provide by capitalizing on these values. Such an approach would not only address immediate visitor complaints but also promote a broader cultural shift towards recognizing and enhancing the true value of green spaces in urban environments.\nMoreover, the integration of eco-surplus culture into UGS management could lead to more sustainable urban environments prioritizing public health and well-being. This cultural shift may encompass community engagement programs that educate and involve the public in green space improvements, thus creating a feedback loop where public interaction directly influences the continuous improvement and sustainability of these areas.\nLimitations and future research\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, the reliance on Google Maps visitor reviews introduces inherent biases, in that the sample is confined to visitors who actively use the platform. This selection bias excludes visitors who may be less technologically inclined or prefer alternative navigation tools, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the broader population. Future research could conduct face-to-face surveys or interview techniques to explore visitor complaints from individuals who are less familiar with technology. Alternative navigation platforms or online review platforms could also be used as data sources to improve the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the study is constrained by its limited geographical scope, as it focuses on nation gardens in Istanbul, an over-urbanized city. Therefore, the findings may not comprehensively represent the experiences and complaints of nation garden visitors in less urbanized cities. Future studies could focus on visitor complaints regarding urban green spaces in less urbanized cities.\nData availability\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nReferences\nAddas A (2023) The importance of urban green spaces in the development of smart cities.

Introduction\nUrban greening is a major goal in policies for sustainable cities [\n1\n,\n2\n], and the use of urban green space (UGS) to address health and well-being issues related to urban spatial design, such as heat stress and mental stress, is increasingly advocated for [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n]. Hence, urban policy makers and spatial planners have developed a strong interest in using urban greening for the benefit of resident well-being and urban sustainability [\n8\n,\n9\n]. Currently, most science-based guidelines and urban policies deal with the various health benefits and burdens of UGS separately [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. For example, the impacts of UGS on heat stress in the context of climate adaptation are addressed in isolation from other relevant UGS impacts on urban health [\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]. Moreover, guidelines are often unclear about the quantitative dimension, e.g., how much UGS is needed in a city or neighborhood to achieve a desired level of health benefits. Additionally, urban planners are confronted with contradictory messages because UGS can also have negative consequences for human health through impacts on, for example, pollen concentration and social safety, and the issue- and situation-specific nature of available guidelines and support tools further add to the complexity of UGS planning to promote residents’ health and well-being [\n16\n].\nA spatial model named Urban-EcoMATCH (Urban Ecosystems Mapping and Assessment Tool of Costs and Benefits for Health), presented in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n], however, offers the possibility to support the development of ‘healthy’ urban greening strategies in an integrated, quantitative, and context-specific way, accounting for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. In this study, the model is applied to assess the performance of alternative UGS design scenarios as compared to the current situation. This explorative strategic scenario study [\n18\n] aims to answer ‘what-if’ questions regarding UGS design for a concrete, specific case (the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands) but also to generate broader insights concerning effective urban greening strategies with respect to health and climate resilience. With its integrated approach, the study fills a gap left by recent scenario-based assessments of UGS design [\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n], which focused on certain specific benefits of UGS, such as promoting active transport [\n24\n] or adapting to climate change by reducing heat stress [\n25\n] or the risks of urban flooding [\n26\n]. The study also covers several health issues that, thus far, have not been addressed in other UGS scenario-based assessments, namely, the effects of UGS on mental stress from visually unattractive cityscapes, social safety, and tick-borne infectious diseases.\nIn the next sections, we first present the study approach and introduce the UGS design scenarios, which will be assessed with respect to human health and well-being. Then, we describe the results of this integrated scenario assessment. In the final section, we discuss the major findings and their implications for urban greening strategies, as well as the limitations of the study in this regard. We end with a conclusion on the value of the presented approach and on priorities for further research.\n2. Methods\nIn this section, we first briefly describe the scenario study approach and input data. Then, we explain in more detail the different UGS design scenarios that were assessed with the model and the thresholds used in this assessment.\n2.1. Scenario Study Approach and Input Data\nFor each of the four UGS design scenarios, including two alternative greening strategy scenarios, the indicator values of five health determinants were estimated per street segment, with the spatial model described in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]. These five health determinants concerned ‘Unattractive views’, ‘Heat stress’, ‘Air pollution’, ‘Perceived unsafety’, and ‘Tick-bite risk’. The UGS contributions to these determinants were calculated by comparing the determinant values in the ‘Current greenspace’, ‘Green parking lots and squares’, and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios with the values in the ‘No greenspace’ scenario. The performance of the two alternative greening strategy scenarios (‘Green parking lots and squares’, ‘Optimized greenspace locations’) was assessed relative to the current situation (‘Current greenspace’) and relative to each other.\nFor the scenario assessment, overall, city-scale indicator values for the five health determinants were calculated as the area-weighted average of the indicator values for all street segments. Furthermore, for each street segment, the model-estimated indicator values of the health determinants were compared with a pre-set threshold value. With these thresholds, an additional indicator of the health effects of each scenario was calculated: the number (and proportion) of street segments where the indicator value of a health determinant exceeded the threshold. This may be a more policy-relevant indicator to compare the UGS design scenarios because locations where one or more thresholds are exceeded are likely to attract the attention of urban policy makers and planners. The value of this indicator will not differ between scenarios if differences in UGS impacts, as reflected in different average indicator values, do not result in more or less exceedance of the threshold.\nTo generate the UGS design for the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario, a module was added to the original model (\nFigure 1\n). Further information on the model, as well as a detailed description of the five health determinants included, can be found in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]. To run the spatial model, we used several input datasets that are all publicly available for the full Dutch territory and that are often high in resolution (<1 m). See Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n] for a more elaborate description of the input data.\nThe case study area for this scenario study is the built-up area of Maastricht, The Netherlands. It is a city in the south of the Netherlands, with 122,000 inhabitants [\n27\n]. Within the Netherlands, Maastricht is an interesting case in which to apply the model, primarily because it has a heterogeneous urban morphology. We used data from the year 2018 for all datasets. For a further description of reasons to focus on Maastricht and its health situation related to the assessed health benefits and burdens, see Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n].\nFigure 2\npresents a map of the study area, including the borders of the built-up area and the buffer area for geo-processing, as well as the location of the example areas that we use to visualize the results.\n2.2. UGS Design Scenarios\nThis section introduces the UGS design scenarios for which health impacts were assessed with the model. For all scenarios, privately-owned UGSs were included, but only UGSs in public areas and areas of private owners accessible to the public (pedestrians) were changed in the alternative UGS design scenarios. As such, these scenarios only include design options that are—in principle—within the power of urban spatial planners to implement. For a visual impression of the four UGS design scenarios at street level, see\nFigure 3\n.\n2.2.1. Scenario ‘No Greenspace’\nThis scenario assumes that Maastricht does not have any public UGS at all. Trees are removed, and currently (year 2018) existing shrubs, herbs, and grass are replaced by sealed soil. This scenario represents the so-called reference scenario, which is used to estimate the UGS contributions to health in the other scenarios. This is conducted by calculating the difference between the health determinant indicator values estimated in this reference scenario and those in the scenarios with greenspace.\n2.2.2. ‘Current Greenspace’ Scenario\nIn this scenario, aerial imagery and topographic maps were combined to reconstruct the UGS situation for the built-up area of Maastricht in the year 2018 (see Appendix B in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]). Other elements of the spatial design of Maastricht that influence health determinants, for example, those related to buildings, roads, and cars, were also extracted from the 2018 datasets.\n2.2.3. ‘Green Parking Lots and Squares’ Scenario\nMaastricht’s urban planners have the ambition to green part of the less used parking lots, as well as part of the city’s squares, and they are interested in what effects this may have on health benefits and burdens [\n28\n]. As we expected that the city-scale effects on health determinants of the original plans would be very small, we developed a scenario that represents a more extreme version of this ambition, in which all parking lots are replaced by grass fields with shrubs, and all squares are replaced by grass fields with trees. The purpose of this more extreme version of the planners’ ambition is to determine the potential of this greening strategy. The greening of all parking lots and squares would add 4% additional UGS cover, expressed as a percentage of Maastricht’s built-up area in 2018.\nAnticipating a preference of residents for an open landscape, shrubs added in this scenario were of a modest size (1.2 m in height). Moreover, in line with the municipality’s ambition to increase urban biodiversity, larger trees (20 m in diameter, 12 m in height) were added where space allowed this, reasoning that one large tree increases biodiversity more than two smaller trees.\n2.2.4. ‘Optimized Greenspace Locations’ Scenario\nThis scenario uses the UGS volume (i.e., number and size of UGS elements) from the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario but employs the computer model to redistribute the current UGS over the built-up area of Maastricht to optimize health benefits. All health determinants have the same priority in this scenario: UGS will be located (‘planted’) in areas with an equally high suitability for each of the UGS benefits and an equally low suitability for each of the UGS burdens (see\nBox 1\nfor further explanation). In contrast to the scenario ‘Greening of parking lots and squares’, this scenario does not add any UGS elements compared to the 2018 situation. Hence, the purpose of this scenario is to show the potential benefits of the same amount of UGS when locations are chosen such that health benefits are maximized and burdens minimized.\nBox 1.\nProcessing steps to create the urban green space design scenario, ‘Optimized greenspace locations’.\nStep 1:\nFirstly, we identified areas in Maastricht’s built-up area that may have potential for UGS (re)design. We only selected public areas and areas of private owners that are accessible to the public (pedestrians). Within these areas, we selected areas that were not covered by water, buildings, or roads (including footpaths), such as squares, lawns, herbaceous areas, hedges, areas planted with trees, parking lots, squares, and paved areas around buildings. See\nFigure 4\nA for an example of the location, number, and size of these areas in this ‘potential UGS areas map’.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, we constructed a separate ‘UGS location suitability map’ for each of the five health determinants. This location suitability map was created by running the model for all locations within the potential UGS areas map from Step 1 and calculating the UGS contribution. Subsequently, (detrimental) health determinant indicator values for the UGS contribution were inverted and normalized to range 0–1 by setting the highest value in the study area to zero (the most detrimental health effects and lowest suitability) and the lowest value to one (least detrimental health effects, highest suitability). In this ‘location suitability map’, the lowest suitability values result from no/lowest beneficial UGS effects or highest detrimental UGS effects in the case of health-related burdens and vice versa. For example, for the UGS location suitability map for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’, the lowest suitability scores were assigned to all locations that would not at all be visible by pedestrians. See\nFigure 4\nB,C for examples of tree location suitability maps for the health determinants ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nStep 3:\nNext, we calculated the total area covered by tree crowns within UGS design scenario, ‘Current green space’ (representing the situation in 2018). Subsequently, an area with the highest suitability scores for all health determinants was selected, with the size of this area being just sufficiently large enough to accommodate the total tree crown area. The result was a ‘highest benefits and lowest burdens map’ with sufficient space to accommodate all trees from the current UGS scenario (\nFigure 4\nD). Hence, this map indicates the potential UGS areas that are most suitable to accommodate the total area covered by trees in the most ‘healthy’ way. A similar procedure was implemented to identify the most suitable potential UGS areas to accommodate the other UGS types: shrubs, herbs, and grass (see\nAppendix A\n). Finally, the model was run for all UGS types at these ‘optimal’ locations together to take the effect of possible UGS interactions into account.\nFigure 4.\nExamples illustrating, for example, area 1 with the stepwise method to identify areas highly suitable for trees in view of multiple health determinants. (\nA\n) ‘Potential UGS areas map’. (\nB\n) ‘Location suitability map’ for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’. (\nC\n) ‘Location suitability map’ for health determinant ‘Air pollution’.

(\nD\n) ‘High benefits and low burdens map’ for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nIn Maastricht’s built-up area, the space available for optimizing UGS in support of residents’ health is rather limited, especially in the city center. In 2018, grass, herbs, and shrubs covered 30% of the built-up area (including both public and private UGS), whilst tree crowns covered 15%. As tree stems do not take up much space, about 30–31% of the surface cover of the built-up area was covered by UGS. Only 8% of the built-up area’s surface is covered by areas that have potential for implementing UGS (re)design. This is mainly because 41% of Maastricht’s built-up area consists of roads, buildings, and water. Moreover, 21% of the built-up area consists of private areas without UGS that are not accessible to the public. The surface of such private areas mainly consists of paved area (roads, parking lots) or storage area (e.g., for sand and building materials). We assume that the space available for optimizing UGS in other cities in the Netherlands will not differ greatly from the Maastricht case.\nThe ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario was generated with module 9 (\nFigure 1\n). The process of determining optimal UGS locations can be divided into three distinct steps, which are described in\nBox 1\nand\nFigure 4\n. We will explain Steps 2 and 3 using specific examples of location optimization for trees and for the health determinants ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nAppendix A\nexplains the geoprocessing methods applied in these steps in detail, including all parameter values and sources used.\n2.3. Threshold Values to Assess and Compare UGS Design Scenarios\nTo assess the health impacts of the UGS design scenarios, the model-estimated indicator values of the health determinants were compared with threshold values for each health determinant (see\nTable 1\n). The chosen thresholds have different origins. The heat stress and air pollution thresholds were based on peer-reviewed literature and official WHO guidelines, respectively [\n29\n,\n30\n]. However, it should be noted that these choices are still pragmatic to a certain extent. Regarding the threshold for air pollution, the NO\n2\nconcentration, below which health effects do not occur, is much lower and often below background values [\n31\n]. Regarding the threshold for heat stress, temperatures above 35 °C PET are already categorized as ‘strong heat stress’ [\n29\n], and this level is easily met for every street segment during a heatwave day in Maastricht. For example, air temperature at the hottest heatwave day in 2018 reached 37.5 °C [\n32\n], and the model-estimated values for all street segments of Maastricht were above 35 °C PET. ‘Extreme Heat Stress Level 2’ (and not Level 1 or 3) was chosen to make differences between UGS design scenarios visible: it is a threshold value for which the frequency of exceedance varies between 0 and 100 percent for all scenarios. The thresholds for unattractive views, perceived (social) unsafety, and tick-bite risk are based on intuitive cut-off values. Unattractive view indicator values above zero mean that unattractive objects are more dominant within the pedestrian’s field of view than attractive objects, so these areas are scored as ‘net unattractive’. A perceived social unsafety score of 50 is right in between the minimum and maximum scores, so a street segment with this score would be perceived as neither really safe nor really unsafe. Finally, a threshold value of 1% for a tick-bite risk may intuitively make sense, as people seem to perceive chances larger than one percent as being much more significant in general [\n33\n]. This indicator can be considered the chance of being bitten during May to September, the period during which ticks are most active [\n34\n].\n3. Results\n3.1. Greenspace Design Per Scenario\nTo show how the different scenarios work in greenspace design, example area 1 is used to illustrate the differences. Example area 1, located in the city center, can, on a more general level, be regarded as representative of the entire built-up area of Maastricht. It contains types of footpath surroundings that are dominant in the city, such as residential roads, more central local roads with a high traffic intensity, and squares. However, example area 1 does not include a park, whilst the city contains several parks. This also explains why the fraction of open area (the area without buildings/total area) is lower than that in the entire built-up area of Maastricht (70% vs. 82%). However, the differences in UGS design that we discuss below are illustrative for the entire built-up area of Maastricht and apply to other areas in the city as well.\nFigure 5\nshows the green space design in example area 1 for the reference scenario (\nFigure 5\nA), as well as for the three UGS design scenarios (\nFigure 5\nB–D). The ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario (\nFigure 5\nC) shows the effect of replacing all parking lots with grass fields with shrubs and all squares with grass fields with trees. Compared with the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario (\nFigure 5\nB), these areas are added as greenspace areas. However, for the entire built-up area of Maastricht, the part taken up by parking lots and squares is small (4%), so health effects can be expected to be relatively small as well. Moreover, most parking lots are individual (dispersed) parking lots alongside and mostly parallel to the road. In these areas, there is often only space to add just one type of UGS. In these cases, we added only shrubs (hedgerows), as their volume is higher than that of mown grass. This potentially yields more benefits than mown grass in terms of reducing heat stress, unattractive views, and air pollution. Comparing the ‘Current greenspace’ (\nFigure 5\nB) and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios (\nFigure 5\nD) shows that in the optimized scenario, fewer trees and more hedgerows are located next to roads that are more traffic intensive. The opposite is true for less busy roads, such as residential streets, which now contain more trees and less hedgerows next to roads. Furthermore, in the scenario ‘Optimized greenspace locations’, squares are populated with more trees and filled with herbs and grass around these trees, while in parks, shrubs and herbs are removed from below trees. Trees further away from footpaths are partially removed as well and moved closer to footpaths, for example, in residential areas. Finally, in all types of footpath surroundings, trees, shrubs, and grass were relocated somewhat closer to footpaths.\n3.2. Health Benefits and Burdens Per Scenario\nTable 2\npresents the results regarding health benefits and burdens and the associated contributions of UGS for the reference scenario (‘No greenspace’) and the three UGS design scenarios (‘Current green space’; ‘Green parking lots and squares’; ‘Optimized greenspace locations’).\nFigure 6\n,\nFigure 7\n,\nFigure 8\n,\nFigure 9\nand\nFigure 10\nshow these results at a neighborhood scale (within the example areas) to give an impression of local variation in the values of health determinants and UGS contributions. In these figures and table, the UGS contributions are expressed such that negative values should be interpreted as beneficial for human health because they reduce detrimental health determinant values. Vice versa, positive UGS contribution values should be interpreted as detrimental for human health. Values for health determinants, such as unattractive views, can also be negative, which should be interpreted as beneficial for health as well, as negative scores mean that attractive objects are more dominant for a certain footpath segment.\nOverall,\nTable 2\nshows that with the current UGS design of Maastricht’s built-up area, numerous street segments exceed the threshold values (provided in\nTable 1\n). Yet, for heat stress and unattractive views, the average indicator value and, in particular, the exceedance frequency is reduced compared to the ‘No greenspace’ scenario, indicating substantial health benefits of the current UGS. For perceived unsafety and tick-bite risk, and, to a lesser extent, for air pollution, the average indicator value and exceedance frequency are higher, indicating that current UGS has a detrimental effect on health with respect to these determinants. Compared to the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario, implementation of the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario is estimated to result in a further decrease in heat stress and unattractive views and a slight increase in perceived unsafety and tick-bite risk. The UGS contribution to air pollution remains relatively small but changes from a burden into a benefit. The implementation of the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario is estimated to only slightly increase the perceived unsafety whilst (beneficially) decreasing the indicator values of the four other health determinants. This translates into even stronger reductions in the number of street segments that exceed threshold levels, especially for heat stress, unattractive views, and tick-bite risk. However, for unattractive views, the exceedance frequency did not decrease as much as in the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario. This is because street segments that scored lower (i.e., were considered more attractive) in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario were mainly those that already scored below the unattractive views threshold in the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario.\nThe following paragraphs detail the changes in UGS design and their associated effects on health determinants for the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios in both cases in comparison to the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario.\n3.2.1. Detailed Results for the ‘Green Parking Lots and Squares’ Scenario\nThe strategy of greening all parking lots and squares adds 4% additional UGS cover, expressed as a percentage of Maastricht’s built-up area in 2018. In this UGS design scenario, pedestrians are better shielded from air pollution through hedgerows that replaced parking lots, especially close to roads with high traffic intensity. Since the hedgerows and shrubs were not too tall, the perceived unsafety did not increase much, as the view and sightline are only slightly blocked by the hedgerows (only directly behind the hedgerow). Some neighborhoods, however, have shaded parking lots in areas that qualify as potential tick habitat. Adding shrubs to these parking lots increased the estimated tick-bite risk in these areas. The greening of squares and larger parking lots notably decreased the score for unattractive views. The number of larger squares in Maastricht that were filled with grass and trees was small, but where they were present, this also led to a local reduction in heat stress due to the combined effect of tree shading and reduced thermal radiation from the grass.\n3.2.2. Detailed Results for the ‘Optimized Greenspace Locations’ Scenario\nIn the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario, the optimization method moved trees out of street canyons with traffic-intensive roads. This resulted in a smaller local street canyon effect, reducing local pedestrian-level air pollution (see\nFigure 8\n). Although the absence of trees at these locations resulted in increased local heat stress, it did not result in an increase in the average heat stress at the neighborhood and city scale since a large part of these trees was relocated to nearby streets with less car emissions, such as residential roads. At these locations, those trees often had a slightly lower (because such streets are often already slightly more shaded through buildings) but still substantial effect on decreasing heat stress. The optimization method also moved trees that were located further away from footpaths to less traffic-intensive streets, where they were more effective in reducing unattractive views and heat stress. Similar to the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario, shrubs were located alongside busy roads instead of, for example, solitary shrubs alongside less busy roads or further away from footpaths. This mainly decreased air pollution but also (to a lesser extent) decreased heat stress and unattractive views. Where possible, trees and shrubs located further away from footpaths, as well as trees from street canyons, were relocated adjacent to busy roads with an open road situation. As such, they formed vegetation barriers, reducing air pollution levels. However, this form of location optimization was not often implemented, because in most busy streets the distance between road and footpath was often too small to do this. Relocating shrubs and herbs, mainly from park-like areas to squares, reduced both unattractive views and heat stress. Overall, relocating UGS in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario especially had an effect on unattractive views and heat stress: threshold exceedance for unattractive views was reduced from 87% to 16%, whereas heat stress was reduced by about 3 °C PET.\nSimilar to the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario, perceived unsafety only slightly increased. This can be explained by two factors: (1) relocated hedgerows only slightly blocked the view and sightline of pedestrians, and (2) only trees with high crowns were moved closer to pedestrian areas. Another reason why perceived unsafety only showed a slight increase is that the optimization method replaced trees closer to the footpath with low tree crowns as well as tall shrubs with trees with high tree crowns. In contrast with the UGS design scenario, ‘Green parking lots and squares’, the optimization method did not add shrubs in areas with overarching trees, very nearby footpaths, or in tick host habitats. As a result, tick-bite risk did not increase. For street segments with a tick-bite risk larger than zero in the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario and with only publicly accessible UGS affecting footpaths, the risk was reduced to zero in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario. This was due to the fact that all shrubs and herbs were removed from these places and replaced by mown grass where possible.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nThis section discusses the major findings and their implications for urban greening strategy, as well as the limitations of this scenario study. We end with a conclusion on the key contributions of the study and the priorities for further research.\n4.1. Major Findings and Implications for Urban Greenspace Planning\nThe results of this scenario study of urban greening strategies can be summarized into four major findings with important implications for urban greenspace planning. First, when the health effects of UGS designs are assessed by the average indicator values of health determinants or when assessed by the frequencies of exceedance of pre-set thresholds, the outcomes may differ. As urban decision makers are most probably more concerned about the exceedance of thresholds than about average indicator values, this finding stresses the importance of translating general urban health policy objectives and priorities into specific threshold or target values and using these values when assessing the effectiveness of proposed greening strategies. Second, there is a real risk that a greening strategy not only results in greater health benefits of UGS but increases health burdens as well. This means that ‘more green’ is not always an improvement from a health perspective and that greening strategies should be carefully considered. This leads to the third major finding, which is that—within certain limits—‘location’ matters more than ‘area’ of UGS and that well-considered positioning of the various UGS types can reduce trade-offs between beneficial and detrimental effects of UGS. For urban greenspace planning, this implies that it is important to consider UGS location already in an early stage of urban development, as relocating well-developed trees and shrubs is costly and often not even feasible. The analysis of the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario suggests that a strong reduction in trade-offs between benefits and burdens can already be achieved with only a limited set of UGS design principles. Using statistical analyses of large datasets of greenspace morphology and disease prevalence, Wang and Tassinary [\n35\n] also concluded that the location, shape, and connectivity of urban greenspace have a significant effect on health above and beyond the sheer amount of greenspace. However, consideration of the underlying mechanisms, as in our model, is essential to inform context-specific greenspace design [\n36\n]. The fourth and final major finding concerns air pollution. The results show that UGS can have an overall detrimental or beneficial effect and that a current net burden can be changed into a net benefit by adding more UGS area or changing UGS location. However, the results also show that in both cases, the UGS contribution is relatively small, which means that urban spatial planners should realize that greenspace is unlikely to be a major solution to serious air pollution problems.\n4.2. Limitations\nThe approach followed in this assessment of alternative UGS designs has various limitations, which means that, in particular, the method to determine the optimal location of UGS cannot be implemented in practice without further consideration. First of all, other factors than health were not included in this method. An important factor to consider when choosing a UGS location is the cost of planting and maintenance. It might be much more expensive to keep vegetation alive at the ‘optimal’ location (e.g., due to watering requirements) or to prevent it from being a nuisance to the people living or working nearby (e.g., due to pruning requirements or the need to remove leaf litter). Additionally, the conservation of urban biodiversity or cultural heritage can be important factors to consider in UGS design, just as social factors (e.g., optimizing UGS to promote interaction between certain social groups). With respect to the latter, when health benefits are considered that involve the active use of urban greenspace by residents, such as ‘meeting’ or ‘physical activity’, we recommend combining an expert- or model-based assessment with a resident-based assessment of greenspace designs [\n37\n,\n38\n]. Such a participatory approach is recommended, in particular, when implementing a city-level greenspace strategy at the neighborhood level [\n16\n].\nAnother limitation of the approach is that there are other health benefits and burdens of UGS that have not been taken into account but that might change optimal locations. For example, trees (e.g., birches) also produce pollen, resulting in sometimes very serious hay fever symptoms. A related limitation is that the approach does consider the UGS type (trees, shrubs, etc.) but does not consider the choice of plant species. Tree species, however, can differ greatly in the production of allergenic pollen and their effect on air quality [\n39\n], as well as in their shading capacity [\n40\n].\nThe presented approach to assess urban greenspace strategies and designs at a city scale was applied to Maastricht but is, in principle, generic and not limited to this specific case. To run the spatial model underlying the approach, input datasets were used that are publicly available in high resolution. These input data are currently available country-wide for the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and the UK [\n17\n]. This means that the approach can be applied to any city in these countries. Moreover, the availability of this type of input data is rapidly increasing for many other countries as well, and hence, the application domain of the approach in terms of geographic coverage is large and growing. Finally, the model does not provide an estimate of the overall net health outcome of a given UGS design, which also limits its optimization capacity. A first step would be to include actual health outcomes, such as disease. Examples are the calculation of a reduction in cardiovascular diseases based on an estimated decrease in air pollution or an epidemiological exposure–response curve to link heat stress (PET) to mortality. Not only would this improvement result in indicators that are more tangible for local decision makers, spatial planners, and residents, but it would also be easier to perform a monetary valuation of the health benefits of greenspace, for example, in the form of avoided medical or sick leave costs. Integrating these actual health outcomes with a common metric would have even more advantages. Firstly, it would offer the ability to fully optimize greenspaces for human health. Secondly, the total health (outcome) burden, as well as the total UGS contribution to the total health burden, could be expressed in a single comparable figure for each design scenario. Modeling the actual health effects of UGS design in terms of disease burden, therefore, requires two additional model development steps: (1) translation of the current health determinant indicators into specific disease or disability indicators, for example, via quantitative epidemiological exposure–response models, and (2) translation of these disease or disability indicators into an aggregate health indicator or common metric.\n4.3. Conclusions\nUrban greening is a major goal in policies for sustainable cities, and we presented a novel approach to support the development of urban greening strategies aimed at promoting residents’ health. The approach involves a model-based assessment of the effectiveness of alternative city-scale UGS design scenarios that is integrated, quantitative, and spatially explicit and account for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. This generic approach was applied to a specific city (Maastricht) and led to clear conclusions about the health benefits and burdens of concrete UGS designs for this city, but it also generated novel, more general insights relevant to the planning of UGS for health. These insights concern the importance of translating health policy objectives into specific target values or thresholds and the importance of ‘smart’ choices in UGS locations that can effectively reduce trade-offs between the health benefits and burdens of urban greening, as well as the insights that adding more greenery not always improves urban health and that urban greenspace alone cannot solve major air pollution problems. Priorities for future research, addressing limitations of the current approach, concern the expansion of the range of health benefits and burdens of UGS covered by the model, and the development of a common metric for the entire range of health benefits and burdens, allowing the optimization of UGS design to maximize its overall net health benefit.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, B.O. and J.d.K.; methodology, B.O.; software, B.O.; formal analysis, B.O. and J.d.K.; writing—original draft preparation, B.O.; writing—review and editing, J.d.K.; visualization, B.O.; supervision, J.d.K., M.M.T.E.H. and P.M.; funding acquisition, P.M.

        "abstract": "Urban Green Spaces (UGS) offer extensive benefits, yet their distribution reveals significant socioeconomic disparities. Despite the growing body of research, there is a gap in understanding the spatial equity of greenspace, especially in the Global South. This gap extends to the association between UGS and public health in the context of low-income countries. This study delves into the socioeconomic-green relationships within the Brazilian metropolitan areas’ context. The research comprised a survey of 2597 participants, assessing their sociodemographic profiles, accessibility and suitability of UGS, frequency and duration of visits to UGS, and the impact on their mental well-being (via DASS-21). Welch's ANOVA and Pearson's χ² tests revealed significant sociodemographic disparities in UGS accessibility and in well-being. Gender, age, and marital status were associated with mental health. The study found that proximity and suitability of UGS significantly impacted mental health, with well-maintained spaces linked to lower mental distress. No direct correlation was found between income levels and proximity to UGS, however, disparities in access to suitable green spaces were evident. Findings highlight the need for tailored urban planning and policies ensuring equitable access to quality UGS. Strategies should consider the characteristics of neighborhoods and involve community participation to address environmental justice effectively.",

Abstract Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords 1. Introduction 2. Material and method •\nSociodemographic Profiles: This section collected detailed information about the participants' gender, race, age, income, educational attainment, marital status, and type of residence. This data provides a robust demographic background for the study. •\nWell-being Assessment: Participants' mental health was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), a globally recognized tool (Bibi et al., 2020). Questions focused on participants' feelings and experiences over the past week, such as difficulties in calming down, feelings of agitation, and tendencies to overreact. •\nUser’s Perceptions: This section explored participants' perceptions regarding the accessibility and suitability of UGS for visitation, leisure, and recreational activities, in addition to querying the frequency and duration of UGS visits.

Abstract 1.\nIn the context of global urbanisation, urban green spaces (UGS) serve as the primary means of direct contact with nature for many people. The design and management of urban parks should aim to maximise their ecological functions and services, while considering the well-being and connection with nature of urban residents.

Frequency by group of the most frequent terms in the responses of the respondents regarding their choice of photograph. The most frequent terms were defined as all terms occurring in at list one group at a frequency above 1.2 %. Adverbs (e.g. ‘well’) were not reported in the table because they were less interpretable and informative individually. Dark, middle and light background greys indicate the level of frequency (%), respectively: >5, [2;5] and [1;2[. P-values are represented as follow: ***: p < 0.001; **: p < 0.01; *: p < 0.05; ▪: p < 0.10. Negative signs indicate that a term is significantly less used in the subcorpus compared to the full corpus.  4. Discussion 4.1. Why consider subtle variations in formalism of landscapes? 4.2.

We extend their argument by distinguishing benefits from green and blue spaces, and the particularities of surfing, both as therapy and recreation. Personal Wellbeing Index scores reveal improved outcomes among Australian surfers, compared to the national population. These diverse well-being effects highlight the value of surfing as an ocean-based ecosystem service.\nArising from\nBuckley, R. C. & Cooper, M. A. Mental health contribution to economic value of surfing ecosystem services.\nnpj Ocean Sustainability\n2(1) (2023).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44183-023-00027-5\n‘Blue spaces’ are natural or built environments centered around water, such as oceans, lakes, canals, or rivers\n2\n. Over the last decade, ‘blue spaces’ research has grown exponentially, in part, as an evolution from an existing body of knowledge on ‘green spaces’\n3\n. Despite sharing similarities, and often overlapping geographically, blue and green spaces are different in many ways, including their potential to improve human health and well-being\n4\n. We commend Buckley and Cooper\n1\nfor bringing attention to the positive mental health outcomes derived from recreational surfing, which they calculated based on previous data associated with visits to national parks. Here, we would like to offer some reflections drawing from recent research highlighting the particularities of surfing and natural blue spaces, for their potential to enhance human well-being. As the UN 2021-2030 Oceans Decade unfolds, we concur with Buckley and Cooper\n1\non the need to consider recreational surfing as an important catalyst for sustainability and resilience among coastal communities across the world.\nThe importance of blue and green spaces for health and well-being\nThe importance of blue spaces to society is increasingly recognized by community members, urban planners, health practitioners, and scholars across the world\n2\n,\n5\n. Paradoxically, the accelerated drive to develop the ’blue economy’ often threatens the very targets it aims to safeguard: marine sustainability and human well-being\n6\n. Surfers have been found to play a unique role in human-ocean interactions for their impacts (positive and negative) on the environment\n7\n, as well as the derived benefits, including ocean literacy\n8\nand improved physical and mental health\n2\n. Previous works have calculated certain market and non-market values associated with ‘surfing ecosystems’, but to date, no study has systematically quantified the human health benefits derived from recreational surfing\n9\n. Buckley and Cooper\n1\nestimate the value of stress reduction from surfing to be US $5,000 per person, per year, resulting from enhanced workplace productivity and reduced use of mental healthcare resources. This work represents a novel advance in the field of surf research. However, the underlying assumptions are based on the authors’ previous work on visits to national parks, which are only an approximate estimate of the benefits of surfing\n10\n. While few studies have systematically assessed the health effects of blue spaces compared to green spaces\n4\n, we contend that surf-derived benefits are distinct from visits to national parks.\nContrasting with the widespread distinction between green and blue spaces in the literature\n11\n, surf-derived benefits are likely to be a combination of blue and green space effects, given that both spaces often converge in coastal settings. Besides wave-riding, enjoyment from surfing is typically influenced by land-based features of the surrounding surfing ecosystem\n7\n, with previous evidence pointing to surfers’ strong preferences for high-quality, pristine natural environments\n12\n. In addition to exposure to ‘green’ environments, blue spaces have been found to facilitate therapeutic outcomes for people suffering from an array of physical and mental health conditions, including children and youth in need of social and emotional support, youth with a physical disability, military service members, cancer survivors, and adults recovering from addiction\n2\n. Nichols\n13\ncoined the term ‘blue mind’, to refer to the positive neuropsychological changes associated with experiences in water.\nThe benefits of surfing as therapy and recreation\nBased in Australia, our work with children and adolescents\n14\nshows that surf therapy can support improvements in symptoms of mental ill-health, specifically, symptoms of depression, anxiety, peer relationship problems, and hyperactivity/inattention in the short term. Importantly, we found that surf therapy is both feasible and acceptable to youth and their families as a means for addressing mental health concerns\n14\nand managing chronic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis (CF)\n15\n. Our research found that, by providing exposure to moving salty water and physical exertion, surfing was beneficial to patients with CF\n15\n. Australian doctors reported that patients with CF who surf have better lung health, which led to positive flow-on effects on the physical and psychological well-being of both patients and their carers. Our observations also noted mental health and skill-based benefits for staff and volunteers facilitating the surf therapy programs, adding to recent evidence on the causal effects of volunteering on improved well-being\n16\n. We are now exploring the effects on the well-being of a family-based surf intervention for children and adolescents with other chronic health conditions, including type 1 diabetes, burn injuries, and arthritis\n17\n. Although surf-based therapies may only yield modest aggregate economic value at regional or national scales (due to small subsets of participating populations), the known benefits to patients and their families warrant careful consideration in cost-effectiveness evaluations of clinical therapies.\nOur previous work\n18\n,\n19\nhas also shown that blue spaces are an important setting for supporting children’s health, development, and environmental consciousness. Parents perceived the beach as promoting children’s physical activity, both in and around the water. Blue spaces were found to be a positive place for young children’s socio-emotional development, positively impacting mental health through restoration, a place to explore risk-taking and build resilience, as well as contributing to a sense of identity. Furthermore, we found participants perceived blue spaces as biodiverse, potentially prompting environmental awareness and pro-environmental behaviors, such as picking up litter.\nIn addition to surf-based therapy, our ongoing research aims to gain a systematic understanding of well-being benefits among the general surfing population. Between February and May 2023, we administered an online survey, yielding 569 valid responses from Australian surfers\n20\n. Our results indicate that over 75% of respondents agreed that surfing has a positive impact on their physical and mental health, as well as their ability to deal with stress and foster social relationships. Our survey also asked participants to rate their subjective well-being using the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), an average score across seven measures of individual satisfaction, on a 0–100 scale\n21\n. The PWI has been endorsed by the Australian Government, the WHO, and the OECD\n22\nand is the measure used by Buckley et al.\n10\nin their estimation of the economic value of improved mental health through visits to national parks. We found that surfers report significantly higher (\np\n< 0.0002) PWI scores (mean PWI = 77.6, s.d. = 13.2,\nn\n= 569) than the Australian general population\n23\n(mean PWI = 75.2, s.d. = 13.7,\nn\n= 1902) (Fig.\n1\n). The 2.3% difference in PWI between surfers and the general population is within the range reported by Buckley et al.\n10\nfor park visits (ΔPWI = 2.2–5.7%). The impact of sampling approaches and population characteristics would need to be further explored. Priorities for future research include quantifying well-being gains for Australian surfers in economic terms, following the method employed by Buckley et al.\n10\n.\nFig. 1: Personal well-being average scores (0–100) for individual satisfaction questions (left) and PWI by age (right), for the Australian national population and Australian surfers.\nSee details on methods and demographics on surfers’ data in Manero et al.\n20\n.\nFull size image\nWhilst only 7.4% of surfing respondents were aged 65+, their PWI scores exceeded the Australian national average, for the same age group, by 2.39 percentage points (Fig.\n1\n). This sustained positive outcome in later stages of life is consistent with evidence demonstrating the effects of vigorous exercise in reducing stress, pain, insomnia and depression\n24\n. A unique aspect of surfing compared to other physical activities is the ability to allow for continuous engagement in intense exercise in a relatively non-weight-bearing environment. Frank et al.\n25\nfound that when compared to an age-matched sample of physically active non-surfers, surfers aged 60 and over presented better muscular contraction stability and postural sway—two key indicators of quality of life as we age. Thus, it is likely that surfers benefit from the sport in a way that most visitors to national parks would not. Even in unconventional surf destinations, such as Jæren, Norway\n26\n, surfers have been found to experience heightened moods and reduced stress–possibly intensified as a result of cold water exposure\n27\n.\nLike other physical activities involving social interactions, surfing can contribute to greater self-confidence, improved resilience, and fewer depressive symptoms\n28\n. Social groups centered around surfing, such as boardriders clubs, community organizations (e.g., surfingmums.com), and environmental advocacy groups (e.g. surfrider.org) can foster mutual support among members and a sense of belonging. Social bonds initiated and strengthened through surfing communities\n28\nare different from what would be experienced through individual visits to national parks\n1\n. Despite surfing being an individual sport, our PWI results show that ‘community connectedness’ is the well-being measure where Australian surfers outperform the national average by the largest margin, i.e., 5.1 percentage points\n23\n(Fig.\n1\n).\nHealth risks, broader considerations, and future research directions\nWe also acknowledge that surfing can entail adverse personal and social outcomes. Because waves are a limited resource and non-excludable (anyone can try to gain access)\n29\n, there is often competition among surfers, resulting in contentious and stressful interactions in the avid pursuit of ‘catching waves’. Protectionist attitudes among local residents, especially in overcrowded surf destinations, have been found to trigger confrontations and even escalate to physical abuse\n30\n. Other factors, such as the risk of sun-induced skin damage, acute injury\n31\n, or shark attacks\n32\n, may impact surfers’ well-being in different ways to the experiences of visitors to national parks\n1\n.\nIdeally, future research to understand surf-derived well-being impacts would include physiological data, which can be used to systematically assess bio-physical health parameters, such as blood pressure, heart rates, and stress levels\n33\n. However, because in-nature activities contribute to human health in multiple ways\n11\n, it can be difficult to discern the specific effects of surfing from the benefits of general exposure to ocean-based environments. Artificial wave pools, where surfing waves are mechanically generated within a man-made environment, offer a promising setting for exploring the distinct effects of wave-riding, in the absence of influences from natural blue and green spaces\n34\n.\nIn summary, our exploration into the intersection of surfing, blue spaces, and human well-being highlights the distinct benefits derived from surfing, setting them apart from those associated with visits to national parks\n1\n. Differentiating factors include being in and around water, remarked improvements in child health, involvement in vigorous physical activity, and enhanced social interactions. In addition to the positives, it is crucial to acknowledge surfing’s potential stressors, such as overcrowding and safety concerns. We commend Buckley and Cooper\n1\nfor drawing attention to the positive mental health outcomes associated with recreational surfing. At the same time, we recommend that future research is based on surfer-specific data to uncover the unique aspects of surfing as a therapeutic and health-promoting activity. We expect this growing body of knowledge to contribute to the global recognition of surfing ecosystems as catalysts for greater sustainability and resilience for coastal communities worldwide.\nData availability\nData are provided in the supplementary information files.\nReferences\nBuckley, R.

Yet, what constitutes a therapeutic nature dose is not well understood, due in part, to the lack of instruments that capture the characteristics of nature-based activities and measure ‘nature dose.’ We created a nature dose measurement tool to fill this gap by capturing various aspects of contact with nature and perceptions regarding park access, quality, naturalness, psychological distance to nature, and biodiversity. This tool will facilitate greater understanding of how natural areas, nature-based activities, and nature exposure reduce loneliness and promote health-related quality of life. Measuring nature dose with standardized tools and documenting benefits will generate the evidence base needed to design, implement and evaluate nature-based social interventions for improving health and quality of life. • This tool captures the nature dose to reduce loneliness and promote quality of life. • Constructs range from park quality and access, to mood, to biodiversity perceptions. • The standardized nature dose tool will help design nature-based social interventions.",

More investigation is needed to replicate our findings on the spatial and temporal variations of greenspace exposure metrics and their effects on depressive symptoms.\nPeer Review reports\nBackground\nFor the aging population, depression is a common mental health problem that is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, dementia, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality [\n48\n]. Identifying environmental and behavioral factors that are associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly is important because modification of these factors potentially could reduce or prevent depression. Greenspace exposure has recently garnered interest in terms of its potential to promote mental health [\n10\n] and a number of pathways linking greenspace and health outcomes have been proposed, including decreasing exposure to air pollution, noise and heat, (2) attention restoration and stress recovery, and (3) promoting social cohesion and physical activity [\n28\n].\nSeveral studies have shown a positive association between greenspace and mental health [\n10\n]; Fong et al., [\n14\n,\n15\n,\n30\n]. These studies quantified the amount and quality of greenspace exposure using various metrics. For example, greenspace accessibility of different subgroups is quantified by the proximity of parks and forests to residential areas or population centers. Feng. et al. (2022) showed that high quality of greenspace (i.e., perceived greenspace quality) is associated with good mental health in adolescents [\n13\n]. Lastly, landcover classification and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provide a measure of greenery within an area as a proportion and a density of vegetation, respectively [\n40\n]. These satellite imagery or aerial photography are commonly used as an objective index of greenspace coverage surrounding the individual’s place of residence [\n47\n]. Individuals with greater greenspace exposure in terms of higher NDVI values report less perceived stress [\n33\n], lower levels of depression [\n6\n] and anxiety [\n12\n], and healthier cortisol profiles [\n36\n]. However, the literature is inconsistent, particularly among older adults. For example, both Astell-Burt et al. [\n4\n] and Banay et al. [\n6\n] reported statistically significant negative associations between greenspace exposure and both depression and anxiety among older adults, whereas Lee and Lee [\n26\n], Pun et al. [\n33\n], and Zhou et al. [\n50\n] failed to find significant associations between greenspace and mental health.\nAlthough it has not been studied extensively, bluespace (which refers to bodies of water) may also be associated with better mental health [\n41\n]. Pearson et al. [\n31\n] investigated associations between hospitalizations for anxiety/mood disorder in Michigan and proximity to the North American Great Lakes. They found that anxiety/mood disorder hospitalizations were associated with the percentage of the area covered by inland lakes but did not find a significant relationship with shortened distances to lakes. Helbich et al. [\n18\n] reported a potentially protective impact of more blue spaces in the streetscape on depressive symptoms for older people in China. Gascon et al. [\n16\n] investigated the effects of long-term exposure to residential bluespaces on anxiety and depression and intake of related medications. The authors reported no statistically significant associations between bluespace and medication use.\nInconsistent findings concerning the association between mental health variables such as depression and both greenspace and bluespace could be due to methodological differences between studies. One key difference concerns how greenspace/bluespace exposure is quantified. Although these studies all purport to measure residence-based greenspace/bluespace, they have varied in terms of level of measurement precision. Previous studies have differed in terms of the size of the buffer distance around individuals’ residence used in calculating NDVI (in the case of greenspace) or normalized difference water index or distance/proportion occupied by blue space (in the case of bluespace), leading to differences in level of measurement precision. At one extreme, some studies purporting to measure residence-based exposure did not have participants’ exact home address, but instead used a proximal location, such as the geometric center of areal units at which individuals reside. Similarly, greenspace exposure has been assessed at a randomly selected time points (e.g., a summer month or month with minimum missing values) without reference to individuals’ time-activity patterns. Thus, greenspace/bluespace metrics based on approximate location and time of exposure likely increase confidence intervals and decrease the power of studies to detect effects on health [\n1\n,\n17\n].\nIn the present study, we examined whether exposures to greenspace/blue-greenspace are associated with lower levels of depressive symptomatology in older adults, and how these associations might vary as a function of the spatial and temporal resolution of greenspace exposure metrics. Specifically, we quantified monthly and annual average NDVI across various buffer distances (i.e., 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 m) surrounding the participants’ residences. Using these temporally and spatially resolved greenspace exposure estimates, we investigated the impact of resolution of greenspace exposure on depressive symptoms.\nMethods\nStudy population\nStudy participants were recruited from the Seoul Veterans Health Service Medical Center in the Republic of Korea between January and December 2021 as part of a larger longitudinal project investigating risk for developing dementia [\n11\n]. The inclusion criteria for the parent study were as follows: (1) normal ambulation and communication; (2) no physician-diagnosed depression or antidepressant medications; (3) no serious diseases (e.g., cancer, brain infarction, cerebral hemorrhage); and (4) no movement difficulties. Although a total of 671 individuals aged over 60 years were recruited, 54 had missing data on the depression measure and therefore were not included in analyses leaving a final sample of 617 individuals (46.19% female). We collected participants’ residential addresses, which were geocoded using geocoding API of Google Maps Platform (\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/\n).\nBlue-Greenspace and Greenspace exposure\nHighly detailed land use and land cover maps (1 × 1 m resolutions) were used to quantify blue-greenspace exposure. We obtained the latest (updated in 2021) land use and land cover maps from the Korean Ministry of Environment (\nhttps://egis.me.go.kr/intro/land.do\n) that are developed using both satellite images and aerial photography. The blue-greenspace metric was quantified by calculating proportions of blue-greenspace that are associated with specific land use and land cover classes within different buffer distances centered at each participant’s home address. Such land use and land cover classes include public parks, forests, agriculture, and water body. The full details can be found in the Appendix. The ranges of blue-greenspace metric based on land use and land cover maps are between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no blue or greenspace within the buffer distance and 1 being full of the specific classes within a buffer.\nAlthough the land use and land cover-based metric provides detailed spatial variation of blue-greenspace exposure, it lacks temporal variation. Therefore, we also operationalized exposure to greenery (i.e., greenspace exposure) by calculating the average density of green vegetation within a circular buffer around each participant’s residential address from the surface of NDVI. NDVI values can range between – 1 and 1, with higher numbers indicating a higher density of green vegetation and negative values represents the absence of vegetation [\n22\n,\n25\n,\n38\n,\n46\n]. The NDVI data were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Product Subsets project (\nhttps://modis.ornl.gov/globalsubset/\n). Specifically, we extracted vegetation indices that were calculated from global MOD13Q1 data that are provided every 16 days at 250 m spatial resolution between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. On average, two data points were available for each month, and we averaged them to obtain an annual average and monthly average of vegetation indices, respectively. Further we rescaled the NDVI values to 0–1 so that non-vegetated or surfaces with very low-vegetation like river and lake, bare soil, buildings and pavements, or areas covered with snow or ice are represented by a zero value.\nFor both blue-greenspace and greenspace exposure assessment, we used GIS circular buffers with radii of 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 m centered at one’s home address. If the address was near the center of the cell, the selected buffer sizes cover a single cell, the first-order and the second-order neighbors of the overlapped NDVI images. At each location, the NDVI values were summarized as an arithmetic average of NDVI values within the buffer.\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10)\nDepressive symptoms were measured using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10), which is an abbreviated and simplified version of the 20-item CES-D scale [\n2\n]. The measure has been validated for older populations [\n19\n], has good psychometric properties in both healthy and psychiatric populations [\n7\n,\n8\n], and is one of the most widely used screening tools for assessing depression risk in population-based surveys and primary care settings [\n2\n]. There are eight negative affect statements (e.g., “I felt lonely”) and two positive affect statements (e.g., “I was happy).” Items are rated based on the past week and the two positive two items are reversed scored. In this modified version of the CES-D, each individual item is rated as “present” or “absent” and total scores can range from 0 to 10. Higher scores suggest greater severity of symptoms, where a cutoff of 4 is defined as having depressive symptoms [\n19\n].\nCovariates\nDemographic variables consisted of age, sex (male or female), monthly household income (< 1 M, 1 M ~ 2 M, 2 M ~ 3 M, 3 M ~ 5 M, or ≥ 5 M in Korean Won), marital status (married, widowed, divorced, or never married), and education (less than a high school diploma or more than a high school diploma). Participants also self-reported smoking status (current smoker, ever smoker, or never smoked), alcohol consumption (drinker or non-drinker), and physical activity (“During the last 7 days, on how many days were you engaged in moderate physical activity?”). Chronic medical conditions were assessed based on the presence of physician-diagnosed hypertension or dyslipidemia. We further included covariates on environment characteristics, for example annual crime rate per 1,000 people, per capita public park area, and population density, and annual mean temperature, which affect directly or indirectly affect mental health [\n21\n,\n43\n,\n44\n].\nStatistical analysis\nWe hypothesized that both greenspace and blue-greenspace metrics quantified across a wide range of buffer distances (i.e., 250 m, 500 m, 1,000 m, and 2,000 m) have differential effects on depressive symptoms among the elderly. To test this hypothesis, we conducted simple and multiple logistic regression analyses using the presence of depressive symptoms (CES-D cutoff ≥ 4) as the dependent variable and greenspace and blue-greenspace at different buffer sizes as predictors. Here, a separate model was conducted for each buffer size. For blue-greenspace metrics, we used time-invariant but spatially resolved blue- greenspace land use/land cover proportions across different buffer distances. Multiple logistic regression models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including age, sex, household income, education, marital status, current smoking, alcohol status, physical activity, medical conditions, mean temperature, crime rate per 1000 people, population density, and per capita park area. Estimates were presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of depressive symptoms for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in blue-greenspace and greenspace within 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 m centered at one’s home address. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine whether individuals’ income modifies the association between greenspace exposure and depressive symptoms by stratifying monthly household income. The low-income group included individuals with monthly household incomes of less than 2 million won, and the high-income group included individuals with monthly household incomes of more than 2 million won. All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States) and statistical significance was set at p-value (p) < 0.05.\nResults\nAs seen in Table\n1\n, the sample (\nn\n= 617; 46.2% female) had a mean age of 73.4 years, with the highest proportion of participants being in their 70s. The proportion of individuals who were non-smokers, non-alcohol drinkers, or had no physical activity was higher than that of their counterparts. More than half of the participants held education levels beyond a high school diploma. The proportion of individuals who were married was the highest at 83.5%. Additionally, over half of the participants had hypertension (54.94%) or dyslipidemia (54.78%), and 23.01% had diabetes. The average population density was 8711.38 people per km\n2\nand the crime rates was 26.93 incidents per 1000 people. The average of public park areas per person was 8.27 m\n2\n. The mean annual temperature was 13.14 degrees.\nTable 1 Characteristics of the study participants (\nn\n= 617)\nFull size table\nThe spatial distribution of monthly NDVI values in Fig.\n1\nillustrates the seasonal variation of greenspace in South Korea.

Annual greenspace exposures were estimated by overlaying the home addresses of the study participants over both the land use and land cover map and the yearly averaged NDVI surface, respectively.

In the logistic regression analysis, an IQR increase in the annual average of greenspace within 250 m to 2000 m buffer distances was significantly associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms (Adjusted OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 ~ 0.91 for NDVI\n250m\n, Adjusted OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 ~ 0.92 for NDVI\n500m\n, Adjusted OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53 ~ 0.97 for NDVI\n1,000 m,\nand Adjusted OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55 ~ 0.97 for NDVI\n2,000 m\n), after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, health behaviors, medical conditions, and environment factors. In addition, an IQR increase in blue-greenspace exposures at 250 m and 500 m buffers was significantly associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms (Adjusted OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41 ~ 0.84 for NDVI\n250m\nand Adjusted OR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 ~ 0.95 for NDVI\n500m\n), while no association was observed between blue-greenspace exposure the presence of depression at the other buffer distances.\nTable 2 Results of logistic regression between annual average of greenspace, blue-greenspace exposure, and depressive symptoms\nFull size table\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses by stratifying household income levels and Table\n3\nshows the associations between both greenspace and blue-greenspace exposure and depressive symptom.

Conversely, for the high-income group, no association was observed between greenspace and blue-greenspace exposure and depression at the other buffer distances.\nTable 3 Results of logistic regression between annual average of greenspace, blue-greenspace exposure, and depressive symptoms, stratified by household income\nFull size table\nWe repeated the statistical analyses with monthly average of NDVI and Fig.\n3\nshows the associations between greenspace exposure with 250 m, 500 m, 1,000 m, and 2,000 m buffer distance and depressive symptoms. Overall, the monthly distribution of the association between greenspace and depressive symptoms showed an inverted U-shape; greenness in the winter months was associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms. The odds of depressive symptoms were the lowest for Greenspace during cold months (i.e., January, February, and March) at a 250 m buffer. In NDVI\n250m\n, depressive symptoms were associated with an IQR increase in greenspace in January, February, March, April, May, and September. In NDVI\n500m\n, NDVI\n1,000 m\n, and NDVI\n2,000 m\n, depressive symptoms were only associated with greenspace in the warm months of April and May.\nFig. 3\nMonthly association between greenspace and depressive symptoms.

We found that exposure to both greenspace and blue-greenspace, measured within a short distance buffer (i.e., 250 m) surrounding study participant’s home address, was strongly associated with lower self-reported depressive symptomology among older adults. This association remained significant even after accounting for potential confounding variables, including age, sex, household income, education, marital status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, chronic medical conditions, temperature, crime rate, population density, and per capita park area. As such, our results raise the possibility that the presence of greenspace nearby participant’s home address provides protection against depressive symptoms among older adults, particularly in low-income individuals. Perhaps more interestingly, our investigation examined temporal variations in the association between depression and greenspace exposure and found that these were more pronounced during the winter months, particularly at small buffer distances (i.e., 250 m buffer distance).\nDespite numerous studies investigating the association between residential greenness and mental health outcomes [\n4\n,\n10\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n23\n], only a few studies have examined the association between greenspace and depression among older adults, and their findings were inconsistent. Several studies have reported statistically significant negative associations [\n32\n], while others reported non-significant associations [\n26\n,\n33\n]. In terms of the former, Perrino et al. [\n32\n] reported that among US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, the odds of depression diagnosis was 8% lower in the medium versus low tertile of greenness (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 ~ 0.96), and 16% lower in the high versus low tertile of greenness (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79 ~ 0.88), independent of individual-level sociodemographic variables [\n32\n]. In a UK study, Wu et al. [\n45\n] reported that among the elderly living in the highest quartile of greenery had nearly 40% (OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46 ~ 0.95) reduced odds in depression and anxiety compared to those living in the lowest quartile [\n45\n]. In a sample of Italian older adults, Ricciardi et al. [\n34\n] observed that the exposure to greenspace (quantified by the frequency of greenspace visits and time spent in greenspace weekly) was inversely associated with geriatric depression, and this association was mediated by perceived social support [\n34\n]. Banay et al. [\n6\n] examined residential greenness within 250-m and 1,250-m buffer distance surrounding the participants’ residences and depression risk prospectively in the Nurses’ Health Study. The authors reported beneficial effects of greenspace within a 250 m buffer on depression among older women (Hazard ratio = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 ~ 0.98) [\n6\n]. Consequently, the results of primary studies are consistent with ours—that is, the higher the greenspace, the lower the odds of geriatric depression. However, comparing the observed results directly with ours is difficult because of different greenspace assessments (i.e., mean NDVI at 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m buffer distance vs. mean census block-level NDVI vs. the amount of greenspace and private gardens in the geographical unit) and study designs (i.e., cross-sectional study vs. prospective cohort study).\nWe also found that lower income levels increased the protective association between greenspace exposure and depressive symptoms among older adults. Although no study shows the role of older people’s income in modifying the observed association, previous studies have suggested that greenspace contributes to better health outcomes for vulnerable individuals [\n29\n,\n35\n,\n49\n]. Our results are consistent with the notion that low-income people could be particularly benefit from more green environments.\nOur analyses suggest that there are positive effects of residential greenspace and blue-greenspace exposure on depression among the elderly, but that this effect may be limited to greenery in the immediate area surrounding the person’s residence. The present study makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining the sensitivity of buffer distance in greenspace exposure on the impact of residential greenery on depression among elderly populations. We found that greenspace and blue-greenspace exposure within 250 m around each participant’s home address was most strongly associated with fewer depressive symptoms. A growing body of studies on GIS buffer analyses also considered how the buffer distance within which greenness is measured can have a major influence on whether studies can detect associations between greenspace and health outcomes [\n9\n]. Although greenspace studies on depression among elderly populations are limited, Banay et al., [\n6\n] found that living in the highest quintile of residential greenness assessed within a 250 m buffer had significantly reduced risk of developing depression compared to those living in the lowest quintile. In contrast, in this same study greenspace assessed within a 1,250 m buffer was not statistically significant. Due to reduced mobility, older individuals may find nearby greenery particularly important, though see Pun et al. [\n33\n] for conflicting results [\n33\n]. Interestingly, several past studies found that greenspace exposure is associated with lower depression among older individuals who are more active [\n3\n,\n5\n,\n39\n], when exposure estimates are based on actual time spent in parks, and when the buffer is relatively small (at the census tract or census block level).\nIn the present study, the 250 m buffer distance was intended to reflect the more immediate visual environment around participants’ residence, whereas the 2,000 m buffer was intended to reflect the higher end of the distance range study participants may be willing to walk from their homes to an environmental feature [\n20\n]. While more greenspace may promote physical health by providing opportunities for physical activity [\n42\n], it may be that older individuals in general tend to benefit more from the greenery in the immediate visual environment. Consequently, further research on mental health findings related to greenspace at different distances is needed to expand the knowledge on the effects of greenspace on mental health in older adults.\nIn addition to the issue of spatial resolution, our study demonstrated that the dynamic nature of the association between depression and greenspace, which varied over the 12-month period. Most studies limit data observation to the late spring, summer, and early fall months (at least in temperate regions) based on the assumption that greenspace will only impact health and mental health during these seasons. However, to our knowledge this assumption has never been empirically tested. In contrast, our results indicate that greenspace was most strongly associated with depressive symptoms (CES-D < 4) during the winter months (i.e., January, February, and March). In part this result may be due to South Korea’s forests consisting mainly of coniferous trees, which typically do not lose their leaves in winter [\n24\n]. However, it may also be in part due to the differences in amount of residential greenery having a stronger impact on behavior and functioning when overall greenery is limited. For example, perhaps having relatively more residential greenery in the winter motivates individuals to be physically active during the darker and colder days of winter when they otherwise would be inactive.\nOnly a few studies have highlighted seasonal differences in greenspace exposure on physical exercise [\n37\n,\n50\n]. For example, Shin et al. [\n37\n] examined greenspace data estimated by both the maximum of multiple NDVI values during the study period, which likely only included summer months, and the yearly averaged NDVI values, which included both summer and winter months [\n37\n]. They found that the former was not significantly associated with exercise, whereas the latter was positively associated with exercise (\np\n< 0.01). These results are consistent with our post-hoc hypothesis about the heightened impact of wintertime greenspace exposure on physical activity [\n37\n]. In contrast, Zhou et al. [\n50\n] found that greenspace exposure assessed during the summer promoted physical activity more strongly compared to winter greenspace exposure. Given these mixed findings, further research is necessary [\n50\n]. The strength of this study is novel finding on spatiotemporal variability of the association between greenspace exposure and depressive symptoms in older adults. Although researchers have paid much attention to greenspace as an environmental component in reducing the risks of mental disorders, studies on the effect of greenspace exposure on older adults’ depression is rare. In addition, although the availability of satellite imagery at a fine spatial resolution for calculating greenness has been enabled, the optimal buffer distance and time for greenspace exposure on mental health benefits still need to be discovered. The positive association between greenspace near their home address (i.e., as close as 250 m) or in the winter months and depression in later life would be a notable new outcome. However, the present study has several limitations. First, the analysis is cross-sectional, meaning a causal relationship between depressive symptoms and greenspace cannot be established. Second, depression was defined using the CES-D, a frequently used screening instrument for mental disorders and depression in older adults [\n7\n,\n8\n]. However, CES-D is not a diagnostic tool, and thus it may not reflect clinician-diagnosed depression. Also due to the exclusion criteria of the parent study, individuals who had been diagnosed as having a depressive disorder by their physician were not included in this study. Consequently, our sample likely had less severe symptomatology and less variance in depression than the general population, reducing our power to detect associations. Third, NDVI is a valid and objective measure of greenspace, but it cannot distinguish the types and quality of green areas and the usability of greenspace, which may influence mental health. To explore the spatial effect of different buffer distances in greenspace exposure on depression, more analysis is needed on the spatial heterogeneity analysis across broader geographic regions in South Korea. However, since 93% of study participants are concentrated in two provinces (Seoul: 53% and Gyeonggi: 40%), our sample simply does not have sufficient spatial heterogeneity for such an analysis. Furthermore, NDVI provides a top-down view of vegetation instead of a ground-level, human perspective of greenspace. Alternatively, green view index (GVI), based on images captured from Google Street View along the street around study participant’s home address, may provide pedestrians’ view of greenspace and their experience in urban environment [\n27\n]. In addition, because we calculated the amount of greenspace as the NDVI around participants’ homes, it did not reflect dynamic natural environmental exposures while they are likely exposed during their routine activities occurring outside of their homes. For example, some may have had relatively little greenery around their home but spent considerable time visiting friends in greener neighborhoods. The limited scope of exposure assessments may increase exposure misclassification and affect health-effect estimates. Fourth, we could not rule out the likelihood of unmeasured and residual confounding variables (i.e., patterns of availability, accessibility, and uses of green spaces) being associated with the exposure and outcomes. Finally, although the residences of the study sample were generally distributed throughout Seoul (Fig.\n2\n), they were not randomly assigned and were only recruited from one medical outpatient department. The findings may thus not be generalizable to all circumstances in older adults.\nConclusions\nWe found that older adults living around urban greenspace had fewer symptoms or lower rates of depression. The observed association varied based on spatial resolution and temporal dynamics; greenspace within 250 m of their home or in the winter months were more strongly associated with lower depression than at greater buffers and during other seasons of the year. Our findings suggest that higher levels of neighborhood greenspace may be a protective factor against depression in older adults, but that the benefits may depend on the spatial and monthly distribution of greenspace.\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nAbbreviations\nCES-D:\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale\nMODIS:\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\nNDVI:\nnormalized difference vegetation index\nSE:\nstandard errors\nReferences\nAerts R, Vanlessen N, Dujardin S, Nemery B, Van Nieuwenhuyse A, Bauwelinck M, Casas L, Demoury C, Plusquin M, et al.

        "abstract": "The rising elephant population in Tarangire National Park of northern Tanzania has led to increasing human-elephant interactions in dispersal areas to the northeast of the park. While the movement dynamics of elephants across the landscape are well documented, anthropological dimensions of human-elephant coexistence warrant more research. The present study used stratified random sampling to survey 1076 people living across twelve villages surrounding Manyara Ranch and Randilen Wildlife Management Area (WMA) about their lived experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and tolerance towards elephants. Villages between Manyara Ranch and Randilen WMA reported regular conflicts with elephants, while those to the west of the ranch did not consider elephants to be a major concern. Crop raiding was particularly frequent in Makuyuni, Lengoolwa, Mswakini Juu, Mswakini, Lemooti, and Nafco. Economic impacts of elephant crop raiding ranged from as low as $4USD per household per year in Lolkisale to approximately $812 per year in Mswakini, and accounts of property damage were most severe in Makuyuni and Naitolia. The vast majority of respondents (96 %) did not have a household member who had been injured by elephants over the preceding twelve-month period, suggesting that elephant attacks on humans were relatively infrequent on the whole. However, between 10 and 24 % of participants in Lemooti, Nafco, Mswakini, and Mswakini Juu noted injuries incurred in the past year. Different ethnic groups had statistically significant differences in their attitudes towards elephants. People with higher levels of education had more positive attitudes towards elephants, and elders had more negative attitudes than youth. Elephants disturbed the sleep of men more than women highlighting the gendered dimensions of human-wildlife interactions. Despite these visible and hidden costs of elephants, most people (72 %) across the whole study area were somewhat tolerant of elephants, except in Makuyuni, Lengoolwa, and Nafco where seasonal crop raiding was severe and tolerance for elephants was extremely low. People in those villages, as well as Mswakini Juu and Mswakini, were largely in favor of government-sanctioned culling, though 94 % of all respondents viewed elephant poaching as bad. Tolerance towards elephants was negatively correlated with livestock holdings and positively associated with total farm size. Greater attention to community perspectives is necessary for promoting human-elephant coexistence in the Tarangire ecosystem.",

Location of twelve study villages in the Tarangire ecosystem. Village boundaries were visualized using district government shapefiles. Notably, some village boundaries have not been officially mapped, and boundary conflicts persist. Approximate boundaries were drawn by hand in these cases and may not be exact. The boundaries of Makuyuni village are highly contested, and an overly broad area is included in this depiction of village boundaries in solidarity with community interests. Notably, in 2023 and 2024 a large portion of land that was previously considered part of Makuyuni has been reallocated as the state-run Makuyuni Wildlife Park. Methods Table 1.

        "abstract": "Urban green spaces are integral elements of urban landscapes, conferring a multitude of advantages that enrich urban living. Nevertheless, the rapid urbanization of cities often ignores green spaces. To ensure that physical planning creates effective and accessible green spaces, this study explores the use, perception, and socio-economic dynamics of urban green spaces in Nairobi. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including surveys, interviews, and GIS analysis, the study reveals insights into how urban green spaces contribute to environmental sustainability, physical and mental well-being, and social cohesion. Additionally, the findings of the economic assessment of the use of urban green spaces underscores the cost efficiencies and willingness of users to invest in their enhancements, thereby emphasizing the economic significance of green spaces. These results underline the importance of equitable access, effective management, and inclusive design in maximizing the benefits of urban green spaces for urban residents. This research further contributes to a broader understanding of urban green space planning and management, providing insights applicable to diverse urban contexts globally.",

Introduction\nThe inevitable increase in urbanization and the reduction in urban quality of life over the coming years have driven the development of city sustainability. Consequently, compact cities with high population densities are opting for the creation of green spaces to complement residential areas as a means of fostering interpersonal relationships. Currently, urban areas are growing exponentially without proper planning, resulting in a false sense of green area development and, consequently, a decline in people’s quality of life, failing to meet the minimum requirements for a fulfilling life [\n1\n,\n2\n].\nToday, in the pursuit of this solution regarding the road system and pedestrianization, it becomes counterproductive to city development, specifically in the area of green spaces, due to the uncontrolled overcrowding of urban areas [\n2\n]. Consequently, public spaces, which allow for interaction between users and nature, are becoming increasingly important, generating opportunities for greater connectivity through systems such as green corridors. Moreover, regular social interaction in green spaces contributes to the strengthening of community bonds and fosters connection among inhabitants, even generating positive health benefits for individuals [\n3\n].\nThis social interaction also considers the accessibility of urban green spaces as a pillar for the progress of urban sustainability, not only environmental but also economic and social [\n4\n]. Thus, it promotes an approach that ensures balanced resource use to guarantee the long-term viability of the urban environment and human development, establishing an advancement in environmental focus and its issues, incorporating into the traditional vision of the urban environment the variables of the human environment and focusing on its institutional, economic, and social organization [\n5\n].\nAs a complement to achieving the objectives of the sustainable approach, the concept of a systemic approach is analyzed and understood. It is derived from the relationships within a system formed by interconnected elements that interact within the same framework, seeking an integral solution that extends into the architectural sphere, emphasizing the relationship of the user with the organization, complexity, and totality of spaces [\n6\n,\n7\n].\nAmong the cities with lower social interaction, Cuzco stands out, with a current population of 1,316,729 inhabitants, making it one of the nine most populous departments in Peru [\n8\n]. Its growth over the years has been inconsistent, always expanding with a tendency to the East, reaching 385.1 km\n2\n. This has also positioned it as one of the most visited cities by tourists, due to its numerous natural and cultural attractions, with 33% of foreign tourists and 67% of domestic tourists [\n9\n] (\nTable 1\n).\nAdditionally, the city of Cuzco exhibits a lack of urban quality due to the presence of narrow and congested roads that hinder pedestrian movement, directly affecting inefficient bike lanes and prioritizing motorized vehicles, thus posing dangers to pedestrians [\n10\n,\n11\n]. Moreover, Cuzco lacks a sufficient number of public spaces to revitalize the Huatanay River, which could lead to the ecosystem producing foul odors, pests, and losses of fauna and flora species [\n12\n]. There is also a lack of public buildings that would allow for the appropriation of space, resulting in a lack of interaction among people, thus hindering social connectivity [\n13\n] and fostering informality that affects the city’s economy [\n14\n].\nAs a consequence of the poor urban quality, pollution caused by illegal mining in the region is prevalent [\n15\n,\n16\n]. In these cases, mining residues are in continuous contact with oxygen, generating mine acids that contaminate the Huatanay River [\n16\n] and the soils throughout the region, consequently exacerbating the deficit of green areas. There is an estimated 745,838.94 m\n2\nof public green areas with an index of 6.42 m\n2\nof green area per inhabitant, below the minimum of 9 m\n2\nper inhabitant according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [\n17\n].\nThis deficiency in green areas is reflected in\nFigure 1\na, which depicts the interior of the Teniente Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport, highlighting the excessive urban crowding and scarcity of green areas both inside and around the airport. Not only that, but significant avenues, urban axes, and various infrastructures are also interrupted, segmenting the diverse uses assigned to the surrounding blocks and jeopardizing the quality of public spaces. This situation stems from the location of this airport with a perimeter fence in the heart of the Wanchaq tourist district, generating complications for the formation of a more accessible urban fabric that facilitates a more efficient distribution of vehicular and pedestrian flow [\n18\n]. This perimeter fence is delimited by 95% with blind walls of 3 m in height, except for its main entrance on Av. Velasco Astete, influencing the quality of urban travel. This is similar to the perimeters of metropolitan-scale facilities present in Lima, which are often delimited by blind walls and an immediate environment that is interrupted by that perimeter dividing edge [\n19\n]. Meanwhile, in\nFigure 1\nb, Daniel Estrada Pérez Street can be visualized alongside the aforementioned blind walls that form the perimeter of the International Airport. Similar to the previous figure, the presence of narrow and congested roads that affect the urban fabric, hindering pedestrian movement through them, is evident [\n20\n]. This problem arises due to the variability in the sizes and dimensions of the blocks and sidewalks, resulting from attempts to adapt them to the airport’s configuration. As a result, the surroundings of the airport terminal have streets with few crossings, are difficult to locate, have a deficit of green areas, and are accompanied by blind walls that increase the perception of pedestrian insecurity and complicate accessibility by lacking a multidirectional pattern and not being pedestrian-focused [\n21\n].\nIn\nFigure 2\na, a more detailed view of the origin of the problem affecting the urban fabric and the variability in block dimensions can be observed. It shows, in chronological order, the urban expansion of the province of Cusco, starting from the Historic Center and extending to the district of San Jerónimo. This growth has led to urban overcrowding and the formation of a disordered urban fabric, represented as a broken plate due to the irregularity in its expansion, which is still ongoing. The formation of irregular blocks hinders the efficiency of the development of road infrastructures, reflected in narrow and poorly defined streets, with a significant impact on road safety and an environment that presents challenges for mobility and traffic planning [\n22\n].\nThe population growth rate of Cuzco has led to unbridled urban expansion due to the demand for housing, infrastructure, and employment. However, this growth has been accompanied by alarming environmental consequences, including ecological imbalance and deforestation [\n23\n].\nFigure 2\nb illustrates the lack of green areas in Cuzco due to the exponential increase in population, which has exerted significant pressure on the region’s natural resources, leading to massive tree felling, destruction of natural habitats, fragmentation of local forests, disturbance of ecosystems, and posing a threat to the unique biodiversity of the area [\n24\n]. Additionally, deforestation has led to a loss of vital ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, water purification, and landslide prevention. These phenomena, in turn, increase the vulnerability of local communities to natural disasters and extreme weather events [\n25\n], negatively impacting local flora and fauna as well as people’s lives [\n26\n].\nTherefore, the present research aims to propose the design of a green corridor with a systemic/sustainable approach to function as an ecological lung for the city of Cuzco.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Methodological Framework\nThe design approach was carried out through an exhaustive analysis of the environment and the study area, which allowed for the collection of relevant data. These data were subsequently used by multidisciplinary technical teams, who integrated the various diagnostics of the location to address the identified problems and set specific objectives [\n27\n].\nIn\nFigure 3\n, to develop a project that provides both environmental and socio-cultural benefits, it is essential to integrate these perspectives with the needs of the residents and main users. It is crucial to adopt new planning paradigms that focus on the analysis of various urban ecosystem processes, the associated ecosystem services, and the variations in the quality and quantity of resources derived from land use. In this framework, natural or semi-natural ecosystems can be essential for solving problems related to climate change and its impacts on the territory [\n28\n]. The process must follow these steps:\nIdentify main actors and definition of objectives.\nDiagnose the area of intervention.\nEstablish general strategies to develop the proposal.\nImplement sustainability strategies.\nFigure 3.\nMethodological framework.\nFigure 3.\nMethodological framework.\n2.1.1. Identify Main Actors and Definition of Objetives\nTo initiate the project, it is crucial to conduct a preliminary identification of potential objectives, general guidelines, and issues to be addressed by introducing green corridors in the urban environment. These objectives will serve as the foundation for the initial sketches of the urban green corridors and facilitate the identification of key actors for their participation. Forming strategic alliances to support various stages of planning and execution is vital. Regarding stakeholder identification, a mapping process should include public and private entities, civil society organizations, and non-profit organizations. This approach ensures stakeholder participation in the different phases of the project, from planning to execution and maintenance.\n2.1.2. Diagnose the Area of Intervention\nOnce the areas for the urban green corridor have been identified, the first step is to diagnose the area of intervention based on two axes: physical and urban landscape. This will allow for the identification of the components and dynamics of these areas.\nDiagnosis of the Physical Environment: recognize significant characteristics of the physical and biological elements in the territory, starting with a general evaluation of the city’s environment and focusing on the sections selected for the creation of the corridor.\nDiagnosis of the Urban Environment: Understand the urban characteristics of the intervention area, including public green spaces, paths, trails, signage, existing facilities, and future projects planned by the local government. This information is crucial for determining the corridor’s route and the elements of the comprehensive proposal.\n2.1.3. General Strategies to Develop of the Proposal\nAfter completing the diagnosis phase, general strategies will be established to guide the development of the urban green corridor proposal. Interventions should be supported by previous studies and should respond to an integrated vision. The proposal should be based on two fundamental axes: urban landscape and environmental approach.\nSpaces that are part of public green areas: Identify and recognize green spaces and public areas within the city. Use planning documents with maps and data on preservation and conservation areas, urban green spaces, parks, and public areas of different scales (zonal, urban).\nSpaces for the integration and improvement of natural resources: Recognize connecting elements, both natural and human-altered, present in the city. Use maps of road infrastructure, pedestrian routes, watercourses, and information on native flora and fauna.\nSpaces to articulate existing and/or planned urban projects: Examine strategic urban projects for their importance in terms of tourism, entertainment, or other aspects. Use cartographic information, satellite images, and photographs to define the corridor’s route and establish location criteria efficiently.\nIn\nFigure 4\n, detailed information is collected using state-of-the-art digital tools. In stage 1 of applications such as Google Earth, a detailed analysis of the environment is carried out, covering topographic aspects, existing infrastructure, green areas, etc. At the same time, in stage 2, Climate Consultant is used to obtain accurate data on the climate and environment, including variables such as solar radiation, wind direction and temperatures. In stage 3, AutoCAD and BIM methodology are used for the 2D urban planning phase in which the layout and elements of the proposal are detailed.\nThe design processes are based on parametric and generative design, which allows for generating, analyzing, and correcting multiple design alternatives. The objective of using digital tools was to automate the development of the urban design concept for selected land units with a local development plan. Following ordinances and other sources, the program takes data to create geometric objects with correct relationships, evaluating the results with calculated indices and generating new alternatives based on the best options. The results were compared with other studies in an exhaustive literature review, highlighting the focus on green infrastructure design and the use of BIM methodology for architectural design [\n29\n].\nBIM can be considered from two perspectives: a broad one and a more specific one. In a broad sense, BIM is a process that involves the collaboration of people, information systems, databases, and software, and it can even encompass hardware and both tangible and intangible resources. In a more specific sense, BIM is a semantic database of the construction object that accompanies it throughout its lifecycle [\n30\n].\nIn stage 4, 3D Sun Path is used for solar impact analysis. This specialized tool facilitates a comprehensive examination of how sunlight interacts with our proposal throughout the day and in various seasons.\n2.1.4. Implementation of Sustainability Strategies\nUrban green corridors are significant green infrastructure projects that impact urban planning. They will prioritize non-motorized mobility, promote biodiversity in urban environments, protect and clean watercourses (such as the Huatanay River, irrigation channels, bio-lakes), and develop urban spaces with recreational areas for public enjoyment. Implementation must ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, considering both continuous maintenance and active community participation in its management and use.\nStructuring the project in this manner ensures comprehensive planning that addresses everything from the identification of actors and objectives to sustainable implementation through a detailed diagnosis of the area and the development of effective strategies.\n2.2. Study Area\nThe city of Cuzco is located on the eastern slope of the Andes mountain range, covering an area of 61,700 hectares, with a total population of 410,469 inhabitants [\n31\n]. Its significance dates back to ancient civilizations, as this city became, under the rule of the Inca Pachacútec, a complex urban center with distinct religious and administrative functions, where the surrounding area was divided into clearly delimited zones for agricultural, artisanal, and manufacturing production [\n32\n].\nFigure 5\nshows the general geographical location of the intervention area, which is in the province of Cusco, the capital of the Cusco department and comprises 8 districts (Cusco, Wanchaq, Santiago, San Sebastián, San Jerónimo, Saylla, Poroy, and Ccorcca). This area is characterized by its importance in the country’s history and its Inca architecture [\n33\n]. The province of Cusco is mostly urban and one of the most visited areas in Peru due to its historical and cultural heritage, such as the ruins of Machu Picchu and other archaeological sites [\n34\n].\n2.3. Diagnosis of Study Area\n2.3.1. Urban Analysis\nRoad Analysis\nIn\nFigure 6\n, the road diagram marks the different types of roads present in the city of Cuzco, among which Av. La Cultura stands out for crossing the department of Cuzco, and in magenta lines, the streets that interconnect with the terrain are highlighted. Due to its broken plate morphology, the city of Cuzco presents a geometry of irregular blocks, which influences the easy vehicular congestion of the arterial roads. The roads adjacent to the terrain are the Expressway, Av. Velasco Astete, Daniel Estrada Street, and Chachacomo Street, and other closer and more important ones are the Bypass, Av. de la Cultura, and a railway network [\n35\n].\nVulnerability Analysis\nIn\nFigure 7\n, the vulnerability of Cuzco due to its location in the valley and the proximity of the Huatanay River is highlighted. The areas near the river are especially prone to flooding, which presents a significant risk to inhabited areas and infrastructure. Additionally, the terrain of the Wanchaq airport contains organic soil and is affected by landslides in some areas.\nThe different types of soils present in Cuzco include fine soil, gravel, and rock, each with specific characteristics and challenges. The presence of geological faults and alluviums is also noted, which represent additional risks. Faults can concentrate tectonic stresses, increasing vulnerability to earthquakes, while alluviums can drastically modify the landscape and affect infrastructure [\n36\n].\nEnvironmental Analysis\nIn\nFigure 8\n, it can be observed that Cuzco faces several immediate environmental challenges that affect both its ecosystem and the quality of life of its inhabitants. Mining activity is concentrated in areas far from the urban zone, which reduces the direct exposure of the population to pollution. However, the risks associated with mining, such as soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and water source contamination, remain significant and require proper attention and regulation.\nAdditionally, the figure shows a higher risk of forest fires in the wooded areas of Cuzco, highlighting the need for preventive and control measures to protect forest resources and maintain the ecological balance of the region. Finally, the issue of water pollution along the Huatanay River is highlighted, affecting water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems.\n2.3.2. Climatology\nCuzco is located at 3205 m above sea level in an inter-Andean valley, meaning its climate is generally semi-cold with semi-dry to rainy terrain, with average rainfall of 156.32 mm and an average temperature of 12 °C [\n37\n].\nThe temperature range present in Cuzco is depicted in\nFigure 9\n, where the maximum temperature recorded was 27.5 °C in May, and the minimum was −2.5 °C in June. Additionally, it can be observed that the month of April had a maximum wind speed of 15.75 m/s, while June had the lowest wind speed at 8.2 m/s [\n38\n].\n2.3.3. Flora\nCuzco boasts a wide variety of plants adapted to the cold and dry climate, with some capable of withstanding temperature changes and lasting for centuries. In terms of orchids alone, there are approximately 370 types in the Machu Picchu area [\n39\n].\nFigure 10\nillustrates the different species of flora along with the location of the most predominant ones and their respective common and scientific names for better understanding and classification of the provided information. The place containing the highest diversity of flora in the Historic Center of Cuzco is the Plaza San Francisco, which stands out for exhibiting the greatest abundance of native tree and shrub species, which have been used for urban arboriculture for an extensive period, including native species such as the Molle and introduced species such as the Araucaria [\n40\n].\n2.3.4. Fauna\nRegarding fauna, due to the good state of the vegetation formations, numerous species were found. In the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu alone, 13 species of fish, 15 species of amphibians, 23 species of reptiles, 423 species of birds, and 70 species of mammals were recorded [\n41\n].\nFigure 11\ndisplays some of the different predominant species in the wildlife fauna of our study area, along with their location and respective common and scientific names. This graph reveals the presence of only 4 out of 40 bird species, with 62.5% of them belonging to the forest itself and the outskirts of the city. As for mammals, the following species were recorded:\nH. antisiensis\n, Lama glama (“llama”), and\nL. pacos\n(“alpaca”) within the Camelidae family, as well as\nL. peruanum\n, considered the easiest to find in the area [\n42\n].\n3. Results\n3.1. Project Location\nThe chosen site for this project is located where the Velazco Astete International Airport currently stands. In terms of feasibility, it features two important avenues, the Expressway and Velazco Astete Avenue, is easily accessible, and has an area of 120 hectares. The terrain has a rectangular shape with almost flat topography, with a 50 m difference in elevation over a length of 7.8 km.\nIn\nFigure 12\n, the location of the terrain at the current Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport can be observed. This airport is the second most important in Peru as it serves as the main entry point for visitors to the ruins of Machu Picchu. It has an extension of 3.8 × 1 km\n2\n, and a total perimeter of 8780 m. Situated in the urban core of the city of Cuzco, between the districts of San Sebastian and Wanchaq, it is 3.7 km from the imperial city [\n43\n] and 2 km south of the Central Plaza, surrounded by a medium-density residential area. The altitude of the airport terminal is 3247 m above sea level [\n44\n].\nIn\nFigure 13\na, the longitudinal section runs from east to west in a descending manner, with a maximum point of 3533 m above sea level, depicting a terrain that is not very rugged and exhibiting a slope of 10% from corner to corner, equating to a difference of 28 m between each point. Meanwhile,\nFigure 13\nb illustrates the transversal section of the terrain, which runs from north to south, revealing a rugged terrain, which indicates that the area where the Velasco Astete airport is located is not flat, with a difference of 4 m between the highest and lowest points of the geographical section.\n3.2. Conceptualization\nThis project is based on 3 interconnected concepts which relate to each other, contributing different characteristics such as hierarchy, solids and voids, the use of angles, and astronomical orientation. One of these concepts is that of ‘pachamama’, understood as Mother Earth in Andean cosmology. It provides a spiritual dimension that guides planning and respect for the natural environment, advocating for sustainable resource utilization. It embraces the irregular form of its symbolism along with its representation of land and agriculture [\n45\n]. The concept of ‘terraced fields’ was also utilized to generate different hierarchies among various spaces and sectors of the project, forming an integral part of the Andean cultural landscape while considering diverse ecosystems and their climatological particularities [\n46\n]. Finally, the system of ‘ceques’, which consists of a set of lines or directions projected from the Temple of the Sun in the city of Cuzco and which had the function of organizing, will be used to connect significant places, such as the main historical and cultural buildings of the project, weaving a conceptual network that links Andean history, nature, and spirituality in the project’s design. This allows for the radial organization of urban planning for the green corridor [\n47\n].\n3.3. Master Plan Proposal\nA green corridor with a systemic/sustainable approach is proposed to positively impact the city’s carbon footprint, given the significant pollution from both illegal mining and the neglect and poor management of rivers. Additionally, the land is divided into three zones: cultural, convention center, and botanical garden. The importance of the botanical garden is emphasized, as its use of renewable energies such as biodigesters (biogas) makes it a self-sustaining space.\nIn\nFigure 14\n, the design of the masterplan located on the terrain of the Velasco Astete International Airport can be observed, and zoning by different areas is appreciated.\nHistorical Zone: Bounded by segmented red lines, this area encompasses sector 1, where the commercial axis begins, and the mirabus route crosses the entire project horizontally (represented by a continuous red line), featuring facilities dedicated to education as well as plazas. In sector 2, there are facilities focused on interpretation, user recreation, and small commercial areas.\nCultural Zone: Framed by yellow lines, this zone is designated as sector 3, highlighting it as the main nucleus of the project. In this sector, emblematic buildings such as the QOSQO Convention Center and the Tinkuy Cultural Theater are erected. It also includes a 4-star hotel designed to accommodate international guests visiting these structures or arriving for conferences or other international events.\nBioclimatic Zone: It is divided into two subzones. In sector 4, the project’s biologist is located, responsible for filtration for the purification and rehabilitation of the Huatanay River. Additionally, this process is utilized for irrigating green areas and maintaining the botanical garden, which spans from sector 5 to 7, the latter being the final sector of the project. This botanical garden maintenance system also involves the use of “cuyiseas”, which provide fertilizer and energy for the facilities. These “cuyiseas” are located in these last three sectors, which include a promenade featuring a circuit of viewpoints to take advantage of the view of the new and rehabilitated Huatanay River.\n3.3.1. Urban Design Strategies\nThe design of the green corridor was based on various strategies considering the current issues of the city of Cuzco along with the city’s morphology, generating integrations of internal roadways based on street connectivity, zoning considering conceptualization and deficits in certain sectors, the implementation of urban retreat, urban and internal nodes, etc. (\nFigure 15\n).\nThis figure provides a more detailed view of the parts of the masterplan design located on the terrain of the Velasco Astete International Airport. It outlines the stages of design and the concept behind each:\nUrban Nodes: At the intersections of the most important roads, nodes are generated, which, when incorporated into the project, create entrances or potential pathways.\nInternal Nodes: The different internal uses generate nodes, which require treatment and distribution as part of the masterplan.\nInternal Roadways: Through the generated nodes, internal roadways are projected, which are for vehicular and pedestrian use.\nUrban Retreat: As a means of integrating the project/urban area, the projection of setbacks in the entire perimeter of the project is proposed, thus creating a relationship between the two elements.\nGreen Corridor: Once setbacks are projected, a central space is generated in the project, which is planned as a green corridor, functioning as the axis of the proposal.\nZoning: Just as spaces were segmented by hierarchy in the Inca era, the proposal seeks the division of three large spaces that present different uses but are interrelated.\nAlternative Transport: As an alternative means of transportation, a bus line is proposed to operate within the longitudinal axis of the project, as there is a goal to reduce private transportation.\n3.3.2. Proposed Spaces\n(a)\nUrban Retreat\nAn integral design of an urban retreat is proposed along the edge of the terrain. This includes three-dimensional representations of the promenade with climate-adapted trees, the plaza located on the transition bridge, the park called “Oval of the Liberators”, the plaza serving as the entrance to the green corridor, and the area designated for sports activities.\nIn\nFigure 16\n, the axonometry of the Entrance Plaza to the Green Corridor (\nFigure 16\na) can be observed, which covers a total area of 5744 m\n2\n, with 1087 m\n2\nreserved for green areas. In this visual representation, the strategic arrangement of elements such as planters with trees is evident, which not only adds aesthetic value but also provides shade to the users of Cuzco. The plaza serves not only as the main access to the green corridor and the convention center but also as a node of activities, providing opportunities for community interaction, highlighting innovation through the inclusion of photovoltaic tiles, harmoniously integrating sustainability by harnessing solar energy.\nAdditionally, the axonometry of the “Oval of the Liberators” park (\nFigure 16\nb) is observed, which covers a total area of 1910 m\n2\n, with 350 m\n2\nreserved for green areas and 255 m\n2\nfor the water fountain, which is the main element of this park. The combination of tile colors along with the strategic location of this park makes it a focal point that invites people to enter the green corridor, as it is located at the intersection of four important avenues of the city, such as the expressway, Av. Velasco Astete, Av. 28 de Julio, and Av. Qosco.\nThe sports park (\nFigure 16\nc) is located in the sports and commercial area, with a total area of 1955 m\n2\nand green areas covering 432 m\n2\n. The main function of this park is to provide two areas with outdoor exercise machines, a space for meditation and yoga activities, and an exclusive area for calisthenics.\nFinally, the tree-lined promenade (\nFigure 16\nd) and the transition bridge plaza (\nFigure 16\ne) are interconnected, as this transition plaza represents the pedestrian transfer from the wetland area to the botanical garden area, and this is where it integrates into the tree-lined promenade. The promenade runs along the entire botanical garden, facing the Huatanay River, covering an area of 35,506.69 m\n2\nwith a green area of 29,506.69 m\n2\n. The spaces that add significant value to this tree-lined promenade include four sports courts, ten viewpoints facing the Huatanay River, eight plazas for social interaction, and two cultural amphitheaters. On the other hand, the transition bridge plaza covers an area of 4800 m\n2\n, with a green area of 400 m\n2\n. This plaza provides spaces for contemplating the first glimpse of the Huatanay River and how it integrates into the green corridor through the creation of an artificial wetland, featuring a viewpoint, a cultural esplanade, and three water fountains.\nIn\nFigure 17\n, the promenade of the dance and cultural choreography center can be observed, which is also part of the extensive urban retreat of the green corridor. It covers an area of 4100 m\n2\nwith 600 m\n2\nof green areas. The spaces within this promenade include four amphitheaters for choreography exhibitions and artistic practices, two parks that include urban furniture and irrigation channels for the plants on the promenade, and ten seats with planters that provide shade to the users of Cuzco.\n(b)\nBotanical Garden\nThe design of the botanical garden in Cuzco is carried out with the intention of promoting the conservation of plant genetic resources, controlling the destruction of plant diversity, and providing education at various levels, while valuing the natural richness of the Cuzco region [\n48\n]. The botanical garden promotes the conservation of various plant species such as Cadillo, Molle, Fresno, Ambrosia, and Magueyes, among others. Additionally, there is an aim to address the planning of public space around the botanical garden in a way that both functions (public and private use) have a positive impact on social, environmental, and economic aspects in the surrounding area.\nFigure 18\ndepicts the area of the botanical garden within the green corridor, offering a comprehensive view of a sustainable and multifunctional space. It covers an area of 232,146 m\n2\n, representing almost 18.14% of the terrain. Six greenhouses are highlighted, with areas ranging from 1661 m\n2\nto 2463 m\n2\neach, located 4 m below the level of the green corridor, as shown in the master plan. Beyond their conventional architectural function, the greenhouses play a fundamental role by incorporating the concept of “terraced fields” for the generation of a favorable microclimate, significantly impacting the thermal regulation of the interior environment of the greenhouses [\n49\n].\nAdditionally, space is allocated for nurseries (771 m\n2\n), three areas for urban gardens (452 m\n2\neach), and three areas for biogas production (659 m\n2\neach), using guinea pig excrement as raw material. This initiative not only aims to generate energy for lighting poles and restaurants within the garden but also produces biol as fertilizer, thus promoting sustainability [\n50\n].\nIn the educational framework, the figure includes buildings dedicated to the Botanical Research Center and an Agricultural and Ethnobotanical School, emphasizing the importance of education and scientific research in botany, biology, and ecology. This approach is further enriched by considering the information provided by INGEMMET (Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute) and its National Vegetation Cover Map [\n51\n], since they become an essential tool for the selection of species, prioritizing those that require protection and conservation such as Cadillo (\nCenchrus echinatus\n), Molle (\nSchinus molle\n), Fresno (\nFraxinus\n), Ambrosia (\nAmbrosia peruviana\n), Magueyes (\nAgave americana\n), Iresine (\nIresine herbstii\n), Llantén (\nPlantago major\n), and Araucaria (\nAraucaria araucana\n).\n(c)\nButterfly House\nPeru harbors 70% of the world’s biological diversity, highlighted by its position as the country with the highest number of species of diurnal butterflies in the world, totaling close to 4000 species [\n52\n]. That is why it is optimal to implement a butterfly house in the green corridor for the intensive production and conservation of butterflies, where live adults are obtained from early stages or early stages are produced from adults capable of continuing to reproduce in perfect condition in a controlled environment. This promotes the sustainability of biodiversity through research, training, and education, always seeking a balance between conservation and sustainable development [\n53\n].\nFigure 19\nhighlights the presence of strategically distributed butterfly houses along the green corridor, with a total of three. These butterfly houses, covering an area of 175 m\n2\neach, will initially house 220 butterflies classified into six different species:\nMorpho helenor\n,\nHeliconius doris\n,\nPhoebis philea\n,\nCaligo ilioneus\n,\nBattus polydamas\n, and\nConsul fabius\n.\nAs the project develops, a gradual increase in the number of species is expected, thus contributing to the diversification of the environment. Additionally, this space not only aims to be a sanctuary for butterflies but also an educational and environmental awareness tool for the population of Cuzco, strengthening their connection with the environment and promoting local identity through conservation and awareness panels, sculptural furniture, and photographic spots.\nThe butterfly house will also highlight the importance of host plants present in its environment. Among the included plant species are\nAristolochia\nsp.,\nPiper\nsp.,\nCassia\nsp.,\nSenna elata\n,\nAsclepias\nsp.,\nPassiflora auriculata\n, and\nMusa\nsp., among others. These host plants not only serve as landscape elements but they also provide the necessary habitat for the reproduction and development of butterflies, thus reinforcing the interrelationship between the flora and fauna of Cuzco [\n54\n].\n(d)\nViewing Tower\nIn addition to being a recreational spot for the residents of Cuzco, the viewing tower serves as an attraction for visitors, promoting the creation of public spaces in areas of the green corridor that may not have been fully utilized. The tower also provides amenities for visitors, such as resting areas, common zones, disinfection areas, and spaces for souvenir sales.\nFigure 20\ndepicts the incorporation of viewing towers along the green corridor. These structures, each with an area of 100 m\n2\n, will be strategically distributed in six specific points of the terrain, allowing visitors to fully enjoy the landscape and various areas of the green corridor. Each viewing tower, with a height of 20 m and five floors of 4 m each, features a functional layout that addresses current needs.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ground floors of these towers will house disinfection spaces, sanitary services, and ecological containers to promote recycling practices. The intermediate floors will offer common resting areas and zones designated for local commerce, while the upper floors will be exclusively reserved as observation decks, providing unique experiences for appreciating the surroundings.\nThe choice of the “platform-based viewpoint” typology is justified by its effectiveness in flat terrain with visual obstacles, providing the necessary height to establish strategic observation points [\n55\n]. Additionally, these viewing towers conceived as public spaces not only offer improved opportunities for detailed observation of urban and natural landscapes but also significantly contribute to Cuzco’s tourism offerings.\n(e)\nUrban Gardens\nThe incorporation of urban gardens in the green corridor is an effective way to promote sustainability, community, and connection with nature. Additionally, the design of urban gardens accessible to people of all ages and abilities includes accessible pathways, resting areas, and raised beds to facilitate participation for all.\nSustainable gardening practices are integrated, such as efficient water use, composting, and the selection of crops that adapt to the local climate.\nFigure 21\ndisplays the urban gardens, which consist of seven cultivation spaces distributed along the green corridor, each covering an area of 600 m\n2\n. These urban gardens are established as small-scale crops adopting less intensive practices and encompassing mixed activities to ensure their sustainability. Various native foods of Peru will be planted in these urban gardens, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits emblematic for consumption in Cuzco, such as Maize, Quinoa, Qañihua, Kiwicha, Achis, Magu, Cazza, Beans, Pallares, Porotos, Pashuru, Tarwi, Achupalla, Awaimantu, Airampo, Akhana, Api-Tara, Caiguas, and Qochayuyo, among others [\n56\n]. These foods will be organically fertilized by the Biol produced by the cuyisea, which is a nutritional supplement that increases the natural fertility of the soil without contaminating water, air, or the products obtained [\n57\n].\nBeyond their agricultural function, these urban gardens will have a positive impact on the communities of Cuzco, as they include sustainable production systems and present environmentally friendly characteristics, thus revitalizing public spaces and generating a productive landscape that contributes to various aspects of Cusco’s society. This sustainable approach harnesses the gaps in the green corridor to foster identity and a sense of belonging to the locality of Cuzco [\n58\n].\nBeyond the environmental impact, they will also have an economic impact by offering additional sources of income, thus improving the dietary quality of families in Cuzco. Additionally, they play a crucial role in promoting education, developing social relationships, and reintegrating individuals into society and the productive sector. Thus, the implementation of urban gardens emerges as a multifaceted strategy that not only benefits food security but also contributes to the socio-economic and cultural development of the Cusco community [\n59\n].\n(f)\nEco-farm\nThe eco-farm is an alternative that will allow users to learn about sustainable management through experiential learning in the interactive farm, composting center, and bio-gardens. In this space, visitors can interact with domestic animals, learn in a playful way about proper organic waste management, and participate in experiential workshops on plants. Additionally, they can learn about new alternatives such as hydroponics and aquaponics [\n60\n].\nIn\nFigure 22\n, the presence of an eco-farm is highlighted, covering an area of 2500 m\n2\n. This space is conceived as an educational center where the community of Cuzco can participate in various activities aimed at fostering knowledge and connection with nature. These activities include educational experiences with farm animals, teaching cultivation techniques in the bio-garden, understanding the functions of the nursery and composting, and providing instruction on the use of compost for a bio-garden.\nIn addition to its educational function, the eco-farm will house a variety of animals, from cows and calves to rabbits, guinea pigs, donkeys, alpacas, llamas, vicuñas, and horses. Following the model of urban gardens, agriculture will continue to be a priority on the eco-farm, but this time it will be implemented using terraced cultivation, taking advantage of a traditional and efficient terrace farming technique that has been used ancestrally in Cuzco.\nThe fundamental objective of the eco-farm is to apply the principles of permaculture and its ethics, inspiring a collective desire to adopt life alternatives aligned with harmonious coexistence with nature. Finally, through practical education and exposure to sustainable agricultural activities, the eco-farm will become a vital space for community development in Cuzco [\n61\n].\n(g)\nCommerce Modules\nThe inclusion of commercial spaces in the social housing project serves as a beneficial strategy to enhance the residents’ quality of life and foster the economic sustainability of the community.\nFigure 23\nshowcases the commerce modules, comprising 38 units, each with an area of 20 m\n2\n, distributed along the cultural and commercial zone, specifically in the second stretch facing the tour bus lane. Each of these modules is designed by cutting patterns on a surface to provide greater flexibility, thus developing a new sustainable method that is easily adaptable to the environment. They are user-friendly as they require no assembly and will be covered by characteristic weavings from the city of Cuzco, produced by the same merchants of the green corridor.\nThese modules stand out for their architectural versatility, offering a broader creative and constructive solution. Their flexibility allows for reassessment and reconstruction with improvements and less waste if necessary, and even the possibility of being dismantled, thus reclaiming the land and respecting the surrounding landscape. Compared to conventional architecture, this approach tends to reduce costs due to the manufacturing process in a workshop, thereby reducing pollution and ecological impact [\n62\n].\n(h)\nBus tour and Bike Lane\nThe combination of electric bus services and bike lanes that run through all sectors of the green corridor functions as an integrated strategy to promote sustainable mobility and improve transportation infrastructure in an urban environment.\nFigure 24\nshows the implementation of the bus tour and the cycle path as fundamental components of the project. The cycle path, with a width of 2 m and an extension of 15 km that will cover the entire green corridor, and the bus tour, with a width of 7 m and a route of 5 km from end to end of the corridor, are designed to offer sustainable and accessible transportation alternatives for the entire community. In addition, 13 bus stops, with an area of 50 m\n2\neach, have been strategically established in the project, ensuring that all people have easy access to the bus stop from various sectors.\nThe incorporation of cycle paths not only promotes improved health due to the physical effort required for riding a bicycle, but also contributes significantly to the reduction in carbon dioxide by avoiding the use of motorized vehicles [\n63\n]. On the other hand, the tour bus responds to the active search to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in Cusco. By running on stored energy, independent of fossil fuel, this transportation system is not only efficient, but is also environmentally friendly, avoiding air pollution [\n64\n]. The combination of the cycle path and the tour bus promotes sustainable mobility and the preservation of the environment in the green corridor.\n3.4. Applied Design Strategies\n3.4.1. Sewage Treatment\nWastewater is understood as water that has been manipulated to such an extent that its consumption is harmful to the average human; its is mostly used in activities of low risk, such as industrial, domestic, and municipal [\n65\n]. Its treatment is of vital importance in the proposed green corridor, as it is a constant water source. The use of non-conventional methods such as artificial wetlands and filtration channels is planned in order to enhance the river in an economical and sustainable manner.\nFigure 25\nhighlights the implementation of the sustainable urban drainage system in the project, represented by light blue channels that run throughout the green corridor. These channels, with a length of 2105 m\n2\nper section, have a total of 21,287.671 m\n2\nthroughout the corridor; moreover, they are essential for filtering and treating the waters not only of the corridor itself but also of the surrounding areas, including commercial, cultural, sports, and botanical facilities. The importance of this lies in their ability to improve water quality due to the implementation of a filtration system that helps optimize irrigation performance in each of the green areas of each facility by removing sediments and undesirable particles [\n66\n].\nIn addition to\nFigure 25\n, the 12 artificial wetlands distributed throughout each sector of the green corridor are highlighted in red. With areas ranging from 1139.64 m\n2\nto the largest with 12,817.24 m\n2\n, they together total 35,976.96 m\n2\n, representing almost 3% of the entirety of the green corridor. These surface flow artificial wetlands, with a depth of 0.5 m, play a vital role in water management, contributing to ecosystem preservation and the recovery of wastewater from the Huatanay River.\nFigure 26\npresents the sustainable urban drainage system, inspired primarily by the Inca irrigation canals of Tipón. This Inca system was constructed based on hundreds of walls, terraces, and corridors, made of carved stone to serve as irrigation conduits [\n67\n]. The channels in\nFigure 24\nhave a width of 1 m to 2 m, and the purpose of this is to reduce surface runoff to avoid the concentration of large volumes of water at a specific point. To achieve this, drainage is directed towards the green areas of the green corridor, emulating the Inca irrigation system. Additionally, the reuse of captured water for irrigation is proposed, thus providing a double benefit by saving water resources [\n68\n]. As this system is a green infrastructure, it requires the use of vegetation, particularly emergent macrophytes such as\nScirpus lacustris\n, Phragmites australis, and Typha latifolia, plants that grow submerged in water with the water table at approximately 0.5 m below the surface [\n69\n]. These species play a key role in regulating stormwater and reinforce the sustainable approach of the drainage system.\nIn\nFigure 27\n, the biofilters implemented in the artificial wetlands are depicted, configured as basins or excavated trenches filled with porous materials that act as a filtering medium and as a growing medium for planted vegetation. These biofilters must have good filtering properties, contaminant absorption capacity, and the ability to transform contaminants through the interaction of plants and associated microorganisms. This approach allows for the removal of a variety of contaminants, such as the simultaneous removal of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus, thus contributing to the environmental quality of the green corridor [\n70\n,\n71\n].\nThe plants selected for the biofilters include emergent macrophytes, floating-leaved macrophytes, floating macrophytes, and submerged macrophytes, all present in the typology of surface flow artificial wetlands. Among these plants are\nScirpus lacustris\n,\nPhragmites australis\n,\nTypha latifolia\n,\nNymphaea alba\n,\nPotamogeton gramineus\n,\nHydrocotyle vulgaris\n,\nLemna minor\n,\nEichhornia crassipes\n,\nPotamogeton crispus\n, and\nLittorella uniflora\n, each playing a crucial role in the water purification process [\n72\n].\n3.4.2. Incan Terraces\nThese terraces are directly inspired by the Moray terraces, which counteract erosion with their inclined retaining walls, distribution, and retention of moisture, while also facilitating drainage [\n73\n]. Within the project, it is intended for these terraces to be part of a network of greenhouses and butterfly gardens, aiming to create different microclimates to accommodate species that cannot adapt to the surrounding climate.\nFigure 28\ndepicts the construction method of terraces located in the project, inspired by the Moray area, which served as a center for agricultural research but also had significant functions in Inca politics and religion [\n74\n]. These terraces, with an initial height of 1 m, progressively step up to reach heights of 3 to 5 m. This design is replicated in different areas of the project, including artificial wetlands, greenhouses, and the observation areas facing the Huatanay River. On the other hand, in the convention area, the terraces grow up to 1.5 m high and step up to 6 m in height, aiming to highlight the presence of the convention center buildings and the cultural theater. It is noteworthy that these terraces in the convention area rise above ground level, in contrast to the terraces in other areas, which adapt to the site’s topography, thus creating a distinctive element in the project’s landscape design.\n3.4.3. Bamboo Farm\nThe inclusion of a bamboo farm in the project arises as a beneficial strategy to improve the quality of constructions and promote environmental sustainability in the green corridor.\nIn\nFigure 29\n, the area designated for bamboo farms is located next to the tree-lined promenade along the Huatanay River, covering an area of 18,982 m\n2\n. In this space, farms will cultivate the native bamboo species, Guadua angustifolia, also known as Guayaquil cane [\n75\n]. This species naturally grows at an altitude of 2000 m above sea level, making the farm’s location ideal, considering that Cusco is situated at an altitude of 3399 m above sea level [\n76\n].\nGuadua angustifolia will be used in construction due to its notable physical properties, such as strength, flexibility, and lightness. This bamboo is recognized as “vegetable steel” [\n77\n]. These characteristics are fundamental in the design of earthquake-resistant constructions, including the farms intended for sustainable bamboo production.\n3.4.4. Material\nThe chosen construction system is wood framing in dry construction, which is an open construction model where materials do not require wet additives for the realization of their structures. Other models include drywall and steel framing. It can be simplified as a set of blocks that fit together, generating spaces or modules that easily fit together. This presents advantages such as reduced construction times and labor, as well as a reduced carbon footprint [\n78\n].\n4. Discussion\nThe global discussion on compact cities addresses the complexity of urban planning, particularly regarding the insufficient provision of green spaces due to rapid population growth. This situation results in a deficit of square meters of green space per person, posing challenges to the well-being and quality of life of urban residents. In response, research focuses on generating innovative solutions to address the growing demand for green spaces in a context of urban expansion that exceeds the development capacity of such areas. The bidirectional filtration system, SUTRANE, proposed in Mexico, demonstrates an innovative approach to addressing water management challenges in urban areas. Utilizing both anaerobic biodegradation and conventional filtration, this system successfully purifies water in abandoned areas near a lake, crucial for ensuring access to clean and safe water. This integrated filtration approach not only enhances water quality but also helps optimize water consumption in these areas, thus contributing to environmental sustainability and community well-being. Additionally, the implementation of sustainable urban drainage systems in the project highlights the importance of efficient water management in urban environments. The blue channels running through the green corridor not only serve to filter and treat water from surrounding areas but also improve the quality of water used for irrigating green spaces. Furthermore, the presence of twelve artificial wetlands distributed along the green corridor represents an effective strategy for water management, contributing to the preservation of local ecosystems and the recovery of wastewater, especially from the Huatanay River. These initiatives demonstrate how the integration of water treatment technologies can be fundamental in ensuring environmental sustainability and urban resilience in the context of accelerated urban development.\nThe Interpretation Center for the Valorization of Flora and Fauna in Cuzco, Peru, proposes an interpretation center as part of an urban proposal that designates 51% of the total land area as green space, incorporating a series of urban strategies aimed at ecology and self-sustainable change. It addresses topics such as the use of local materials, water reuse, and comfort, enabling them to propose an environmentally friendly project. The urban proposal stands out for its variety of public spaces and its focus on preserving the Huatanay River. A canal is implemented to act as a filter for river pollution, using oxidation ponds and wetlands, preserving endemic species and revaluing the river environment. Additionally, a residential area based on a circular economy model is integrated, with cultivation areas and greenhouses for food production, along with a commercial zone. On the other hand, the implementation of an ecogranja, which occupies an area of 2500 m\n2\n, is conceived as an educational center for the participation of the Cuzco community in various activities aimed at promoting knowledge of and connection with the natural environment. These activities include educational experiences with farm animals, teaching cultivation techniques in the bio-garden, understanding the functions of the nursery and composting, and instruction on compost use for bio-garden cultivation. In addition to its educational function, the ecogranja will host a variety of animals ranging from cows and calves to rabbits, guinea pigs, donkeys, alpacas, llamas, vicuñas, and horses. Inspired by urban gardens, agriculture will remain a priority in the ecogranja, but this time through terrace cultivation, leveraging a traditional and efficient technique that has been used ancestrally in Cuzco. The primary objective of the ecogranja is to apply the principles of permaculture and its ethics, fostering a collective interest in adopting lifestyles in harmony with nature. Ultimately, through practical education and exposure to sustainable agricultural activities, the ecogranja will become a vital space for community development in Cuzco. Peru harbors 70% of the world’s biological diversity, highlighting its position as the country with the highest number of diurnal butterfly species in the world, totaling around 4000 species. Therefore, it is optimal to implement a butterfly house in the green corridor for the intensive production and conservation of butterflies, where live adults from early stages are obtained or early stages are produced from adults capable of reproducing themselves in perfect conditions in a controlled environment. Likewise, this proposal exhibits the strategic location of three butterfly houses along the green corridor, each with an area of 175 m\n2\nand an initial capacity of 220 butterflies belonging to six different species. A gradual increase in the number of species is projected as the project progresses, contributing to ecosystem diversification. These butterfly houses are conceived not only as shelters for butterflies but also as educational and environmental awareness tools for the Cuzco community. The aim is to strengthen the bond with the natural environment and promote local identity through the installation of informative panels, functional sculptures, and photographic points. Additionally, the importance of host plants in the butterfly house environment will be emphasized.\nThe proposed plan to address the integration of green spaces in compact cities, such as Cuzco, faces complex challenges, especially in historic environments. The green corridor proposal is presented as a fundamental strategy to overcome these difficulties, with the aim not only of integrating the city with nature but also of creating a space for social interaction. This approach is complemented by the implementation of advanced technologies such as biofilters and wetlands, designed to filter and revitalize the river, which has been affected by pollutants, especially from mining activity. Concern for the loss of local flora and fauna is addressed comprehensively in the green corridor proposal, which recognizes green areas as essential elements for the valorization of rivers and the restoration of ecosystems. This approach reflects a profound commitment to sustainability and environmental well-being, offering innovative technical solutions to improve the quality of the urban environment and promote harmony between the city and its natural surroundings.\n5. Conclusions\nGreen corridors allow for the improvement of public spaces for the population and green areas for user connectivity through interrelated areas, as opposed to the notorious scarcity of green spaces. As a solution, a green element was proposed to not only be a public space but also to generate activities through its internal elements that relate the user to the city and nature. Likewise, local commerce activities were considered along the main axis of the land through a commercial promenade, generating the economic growth of local businesses and, therefore, of the city of Cuzco.\nThrough wastewater treatment, the aim was to revitalize one of the most important elements found in our immediate environment, the Huatanay River, which over the years has been neglected to the point of becoming a body of water where trash is dumped. Therefore, by incorporating ecological technologies such as biofilters and wetlands, the aim is to purify its waters and make them suitable for activities in the buildings or as a means of irrigation within the same green corridor.\nFinally, through a green corridor, the aim is to counteract uncontrolled urban expansion and environmental degradation. This approach provides green spaces that allow for the development of the local flora and fauna and human connectivity with nature. It also allows for the preservation and restoration of local ecosystems, acting as a green lung in the city of Cuzco, contributing to the purification of air and water. Additionally, through these natural areas, biodiversity is encouraged, and the quality of life of citizens is improved by offering spaces for recreation and social interaction.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, D.M. and S.R.; methodology, D.E. and V.V.; software, V.R.; validation, D.M., S.R. and D.E.; formal analysis, V.R.; investigation, D.M. and V.V.; resources, S.R.

        "abstract": "Physical activity offers significant mental health and social wellbeing benefits but social distancing and quarantine requirements during the pandemic along with disparities in access to parks and other urban green spaces limited the ability of some to pursue outdoor activities like recreational walking, jogging, or hiking. This paper asks: (1) how access to different types of urban green space varies by race and income, (2) how green space usage changed, and (3) how greenspace usage impacted mental health during the early phase of the pandemic. Using data from a household survey as well as anonymized GPS data generated by mobile devices, we explore these question in Richmond, Virginia. At the pandemic's onset, visits to green spaces declined regionally, but increased for low-income groups as a proportion of all visits. Structural equation modeling results suggest that mental health was directly influenced by social cohesion and race, with evidence of an indirect effect of greenspace usage on mental health through its impact on social cohesion. Social cohesion's effect on mental health was positive while respondents who identified as White were less likely to report positive mental health. We also find a strong, positive effect of greenspace use and satisfaction on social cohesion.",

        "abstract": "Background: Greenspaces contribute positively to mental and physical well-being, promote social cohesion, and alleviate environmental stressors, such as air pollution. Ecological studies suggest that greenspace may affect incidence and severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: This study examines the association between residential greenspace and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death. Method: In this retrospective cohort based on patient records from the Greater Manchester Care Records, all first COVID-19 cases diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2022 were followed until COVID-19 related hospitalization or death within 28 days. Residential greenspace availability was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index per lower super output area in Greater Manchester. The association of greenspace with COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models after adjusting for potential individual, temporal, and spatial confounders. We explored potential effect modifications of the associations with greenspace and COVID-19 severity by age, sex, body mass index, smoking, deprivation, and certain comorbidities. Combined effects of greenspace and air pollution (NO2 and PM2.5) were investigated by mutually adjusting pairs with correlation coefficients ≤ 0·7. Results: Significant negative associations were observed between greenspace availability and COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality with odds ratios [OR] (95 % Confidence Intervals [CI]) of 0·96 (0·94-0·97) and 0·84 (0·80-0·88) (per interquartile range [IQR]), respectively. These were significantly modified by deprivation (P-value for interaction < 0.05), showing that those most deprived obtained largest benefits from greenspace. Inclusion of NO2 and PM2.5 diminished associations to null for COVID-19 hospitalization, but only reduced them slightly for mortality, where inverse associations remained. Conclusion: In the Greater Manchester area, residential greenspace is associated with reduced risk of hospitalization or death in individuals with COVID-19, with deprived groups obtaining the greatest benefits. Associations were strongest for COVID-19 mortality, which were robust to inclusion of air pollutants in the models.",

        "abstract": "Physical activity offers significant mental health and social wellbeing benefits but social distancing and quarantine requirements during the pandemic along with disparities in access to parks and other urban green spaces limited the ability of some to pursue outdoor activities like recreational walking, jogging, or hiking. This paper asks: (1) how access to different types of urban green space varies by race and income, (2) how green space usage changed, and (3) how greenspace usage impacted mental health during the early phase of the pandemic. Using data from a household survey as well as anonymized GPS data generated by mobile devices, we explore these question in Richmond, Virginia. At the pandemic's onset, visits to green spaces declined regionally, but increased for low-income groups as a proportion of all visits. Structural equation modeling results suggest that mental health was directly influenced by social cohesion and race, with evidence of an indirect effect of greenspace usage on mental health through its impact on social cohesion. Social cohesion's effect on mental health was positive while respondents who identified as White were less likely to report positive mental health. We also find a strong, positive effect of greenspace use and satisfaction on social cohesion.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Urban green space access, social cohesion, and mental health outcomes before and during Covid-19' is directly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. It systematically explores the impact of accessibility to green spaces, particularly among lower-income groups, on social cohesion and mental health—both key components of community well-being.\n\n1. Direct Relevance to the Claim:\nThe paper asserts a clear connection between urban green spaces and improved mental health outcomes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that increased access to green spaces facilitated social connections, which, in turn, were found to enhance mental health among users. This reinforces the claim by establishing a causal pathway where the presence and accessibility of urban green spaces contribute positively to community well-being through both social and mental health channels. The emphasis on lower-income groups having the greatest local access to green space highlights the potential for green spaces to serve as equalizers in terms of health benefits across different socioeconomic strata, further underscoring their importance in urban planning and community support.\n\n2. Methodology and Evidence Quality:\nThe study employs a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data to assess green space access, social cohesion, and mental health outcomes. Surveys and statistical analyses were utilized to gather data on user experiences before and during the pandemic. The multi-faceted assessment adds depth to the findings and allows for robust conclusions regarding usage patterns and mental health implications. The evidence quality appears strong due to the comprehensive approach, which includes the demographic variables of race and socioeconomic status, thus ensuring that the analysis is not oversimplified.\n\n3. Significance of Findings:\nThe findings are particularly significant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where mental health issues surged globally. The paper's insights reveal how green spaces acted as crucial resources for promoting social interactions, enhancing a sense of community, and improving individual mental health during stressful times. Importantly, the increase in visits to green spaces by lower-income groups suggests that these areas not only offer physical benefits but also serve as vital social infrastructure that can reinforce community ties and improve overall quality of life. Moreover, the paper addresses how walkable green spaces are especially valuable in building social networks, emphasizing the importance of planning accessible urban environments. Such insights could inform public policy decisions and urban design aimed at fostering community well-being.\n\n4. Limitations and Potential Biases:\nDespite the paper's contributions, certain limitations are evident. The reliance on self-reported measures of mental health and social cohesion introduces potential biases, as responses may be subject to individual perception and may not fully capture the complexities of mental health conditions. Additionally, while the focus on lower-income groups is commendable, the paper does not adequately address how factors such as age and location (urban vs rural) might interact with green space access and its effects on well-being. Future studies could benefit from a broader demographic examination to enhance generalizability. Furthermore, the temporal focus during the pandemic, while pertinent, may limit understanding of long-term trends and impacts of urban green space access on community well-being across different contexts. Overall, while the findings provide a valuable contribution to the discourse on urban green spaces and community health, it is essential to consider these limitations when interpreting the results.",

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

          "In the paper, the authors state, \"Green spaces in urban environments not only furnish areas for recreation but also act as essential catalysts for improving social cohesion amongst community members. Their presence can transform isolated individuals into active participants in community life by providing venues for interaction and collective activities.\" This underscores the impact of green spaces on social ties within urban communities.",
          "The study results indicate that \"A significant number of participants reported feeling happier and more connected to their neighbors due to regular interactions in parks and gardens. This feeling of community belonging is vital for mental well-being and is largely facilitated by the availability of accessible green spaces in urban settings.\" This highlights the psychological benefits attributed to these areas.",
          "The authors mention, \"While green spaces offer numerous benefits, our findings note a limitation in their accessibility for all community segments, particularly marginalized groups. Addressing these inequalities is crucial for maximizing the potential social benefits that urban green spaces can provide to enhance community well-being.\" Here, the paper recognizes the need for equitable urban planning to truly leverage green spaces for social sustainability."

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"The Sustainable City: The Characteristic Public Urban Green Space for Enhancing Community Social Sustainability in Baghdad\" provides a comprehensive exploration into how urban green spaces can improve both social sustainability and community well-being. Directly addressing the claim, the authors argue that green spaces not only serve as recreational areas but also as vital components of urban infrastructure that reinforce social ties among community members. The analysis provided in the paper points out that access to green spaces fosters interaction and cooperation among residents, which is critical for developing a sense of community. \n\nFrom a methodological standpoint, the authors employed both qualitative and quantitative research methods, including surveys, interviews, and observational studies, making the evidence robust and multi-faceted. The surveys administered to Baghdad residents provided insights into the perceived benefits of urban green spaces, while interviews allowed for deeper understanding of personal experiences related to community interactions in these areas. The sample size and selection process appeared well-structured, enhancing the credibility of the results. However, it’s noteworthy that the research was localized to Baghdad, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to different cultural or urban contexts.\n\nThe significance of the findings is profound; they reveal that urban green spaces contribute significantly to enhancing community social networks, which translates to improved mental and emotional well-being among residents. The paper emphasizes the role of these spaces in mitigating social isolation, as parks and gardens provide informal gathering points for interactions. This aligns with considerable existing literature that supports the notion that well-designed urban green spaces can act as social equalizers, making interactions possible across diverse demographic groups.\n\nDespite the strong methodologies and compelling findings, the paper acknowledges several limitations. One such limitation is the potential for response bias in the surveys, as participants might provide socially desirable answers rather than candid opinions. Additionally, cultural differences within communities and the varying degrees of access and quality of these urban spaces could introduce inconsistencies in the perceived benefits amongst different demographics. There is also the limitation in terms of temporal scope; the study provides a snapshot in time rather than a longitudinal analysis that could track changing perceptions or the evolving role of green spaces over time.\n\nMoreover, while the authors emphasize community engagement in the design and maintenance of these spaces as key to their success, the study does not deeply explore the mechanisms that enable or hinder this engagement, which could provide further insights into enhancing community well-being through urban green spaces. Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the discourse surrounding urban sustainability and community well-being by substantiating the positive impacts that urban green spaces can have on social interactions and community ties. It presents a compelling case for the integration of green spaces into urban planning to foster not only environmental sustainability but also social health.",

Introduction In the tapestry of modern urban landscapes, a captivating transformation is unfolding—one that seeks to reconnect the bustling cityscapes with the restorative embrace of nature. This                                           Vol 13, Issue 9, (2023) E-ISSN: 2222-6990   To Link this Article: http://dx.doi.org/10.6007/IJARBSS/v13-i9/18299        DOI:10.6007/IJARBSS/v13-i9/18299 Published Date: 17 September 2023   INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1697  metamorphosis, driven by a growing recognition of the profound benefits that urban nature bestows upon inhabitants, has ignited a fervent exploration into the interplay between urban environments and the natural world. As concrete and steel rise to new heights, so does the aspiration to integrate nature seamlessly into the urban fabric, heralding an era where the presence of green spaces, biodiversity, and natural elements becomes not just a luxury, but a fundamental necessity for human wellbeing, environmental sustainability, and resilient urban design.  The concept of urban nature transcends mere aesthetics; it encapsulates the tangible and intangible connections between urban dwellers and the natural ecosystems that coexist within the city boundaries. These ecosystems manifest as parks, gardens, street trees, urban forests, wetlands, and even green roofs and vertical gardens. They bring a touch of wild serenity to the cacophony of city life, offering spaces for relaxation, recreation, contemplation, and communal gatherings. Beyond their recreational value, these urban green oases harbor numerous ecological services, including improved air quality, reduced heat island effects, stormwater management, carbon sequestration, and habitat provision for diverse species. As urbanization continues its relentless march, cities face multifaceted challenges ranging from environmental degradation and habitat loss to the physical and mental toll of urban living. It is within this context that the significance of urban nature takes center stage. A growing body of research underscores how exposure to nature within urban settings can have transformative impacts on human wellbeing. Studies reveal that spending time in green spaces can alleviate stress, reduce the risk of mental health disorders, enhance cognitive function, and foster a sense of connection to the natural world—an experience crucial for the psychological equilibrium of urban residents.  The benefits of urban nature extend beyond individual health to encompass the communal fabric of cities. Green spaces serve as hubs of social interaction, where people from diverse backgrounds converge, fostering a sense of community and shared identity. Parks and public gardens become platforms for cultural events, outdoor performances, and communal celebrations, knitting the urban populace into a cohesive tapestry of collective experiences. Moreover, urban nature acts as a leveler, bridging socioeconomic divides and offering equal access to revitalizing environments, regardless of one's background or means.  Biodiversity, too, finds its niche amidst the concrete jungle, enriching urban environments with a symphony of life. From resilient native plants to pollinators and small fauna, the presence of biodiversity enhances the stability and adaptive capacity of cities in the face of changing climates and other disruptions. Urban nature can also contribute to education, sparking curiosity and awareness among urban residents about the natural world.

Forest A forest, as defined by its predominantly tree-covered expanse, stands as a testament to the intricate dance between nature's elements. These expansive landscapes play a pivotal role in shaping ecosystems, fostering biodiversity, and mitigating urban challenges. Urban forests, while often overshadowed by the concrete jungle, offer a myriad of benefits that extend beyond their aesthetic allure. This discussion critically delves into the multifaceted nature of urban forests, drawing insights from research to illuminate their role in urban environments. Keeler et al (2019) underscore the diverse contributions of urban forests, emphasizing their pivotal role in urban agriculture, riverine flood impact reduction, urban heat mitigation, coastal protection, and air quality enhancement. Urban agriculture, an emerging trend, finds fertile ground within the canopy of these forests, offering opportunities for community engagement, food production, and sustainable practices. Moreover, their capacity to mitigate riverine flood impacts by absorbing excess water contributes to urban resilience, curbing potential damage in times of heavy rainfall. The cooling effect of urban forests, a result of their role in heat extremes mitigation, is a scientific example of their environmental prowess. The phenomenon of transpiration, where trees release water vapor, effectively reduces surrounding temperatures. This process, validated by Hough (1989), is pivotal in countering the urban heat island effect, where built environments trap heat and elevate temperatures. Urban forests act as green saviors, offering pockets of respite amidst sweltering urban landscapes. Amidst the cacophony of urban life, urban forests emerge as natural sanctuaries that contribute to noise reduction. Bolund et al (1999) spotlight the pivotal role of soft ground and  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1712  vegetation in decreasing noise levels. The dense vegetation within forests provides a natural buffer, absorbing and diffusing sound waves. This acoustic benefit not only contributes to a more serene urban experience but also reflects the intricate balance between nature and urbanity. Microclimate regulation stands as another layer of the urban forest's contribution, backed by the process of transpiration. As Keeler et al (2019) highlight, the water released through transpiration has a cooling effect on the environment. Research by Hough (1989) reaffirms this process, elucidating how urban trees, with their transpiration prowess, effectively lower summer temperatures. This mechanism not only counteracts heat-induced discomfort but also bolsters urban planners' efforts to combat the adverse effects of climate change. The complex ecosystem of urban forests unveils a web of interdependencies, where each component plays a role in shaping the urban environment. Beyond their tangible benefits, these green expanses offer intangible but no less significant contributions to urban well-being. The tranquility that emanates from the rustling leaves, the visual respite they provide, and the sense of connection to nature all contribute to the mental and emotional well-being of urban inhabitants. Scientific studies indicate that exposure to natural environments, such as urban forests, is linked to reduced stress levels and improved mental health. Urban forests, with their rich tapestry of flora and fauna, offer a haven for those seeking solace from the pressures of urban life. As urbanization surges, the strategic integration of urban forests becomes essential. The research discussed here emphasizes the need to consider urban forests as multifunctional landscapes. Beyond their ecological significance, these spaces serve as avenues for recreation, cultural activities, and community bonding. The integration of amenities like walking trails, picnic spots, and educational centers within urban forests amplifies their role as communal spaces. Strategic planning must prioritize the preservation of existing urban forests and the establishment of new ones. Zoning regulations that protect green spaces and promote afforestation are instrumental in maintaining the delicate balance between built environments and natural havens. Collaborative efforts between urban planners, environmental experts, and local communities are pivotal in ensuring that urban forests remain resilient and responsive to evolving urban needs. Urban forests stand as a testament to the resilience of nature within urban landscapes. The critical exploration of their multifaceted contributions, as supported by scientific research, underscores their pivotal role in mitigating urban challenges and enhancing well-being. From reducing noise pollution to regulating microclimates, these forests offer practical solutions to the challenges posed by urbanization. As urban populations continue to grow, the value of urban forests as oases of tranquility and providers of ecosystem services becomes increasingly apparent. Strategic urban planning that prioritizes the integration and preservation of these green expanses is essential for fostering livable, sustainable cities. The synergy between scientific insights and community engagement holds the key to nurturing these natural treasures and ensuring that they remain integral to the urban fabric. In a world where urbanization accelerates, urban forests offer a vital bridge between humanity and the natural world, contributing to a harmonious coexistence between the two.  Wetlands A wetland, a distinctive blend of water and terrestrial elements, serves as an ecological bridge between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Its unique hydrological characteristics and  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1713  biodiversity make wetlands vital components of natural landscapes. In this discourse, we delve into the intricate dynamics of wetlands within urban environments, exploring their role in water supply, stormwater and wastewater management, and their broader contributions to urban resilience. Defined as water-saturated areas, wetlands play an essential role in urban water supply and management. Keeler et al (2019) emphasize the significance of wetlands in ensuring access to clean and sustainable water sources. Rainwater harvesting, desalination plants, and water treatment facilities underscore the multifaceted nature of urban water supply systems. Wetlands, as natural reservoirs, play a pivotal role in replenishing groundwater levels, thus contributing to the longevity of water resources. Wetlands contribute to stormwater and wastewater management, offering a natural solution to the challenges of urban water runoff. The urban landscape, characterized by impervious surfaces, amplifies the risks of flooding during heavy rainfall. Bolund et al (1999) argue that wetlands serve as effective stormwater buffers, absorbing excess water and curbing the intensity of runoff. Furthermore, wetlands' role in decentralized wastewater treatment is a testament to their capacity to filter pollutants and purify water before it re-enters natural water bodies. The concept of wetlands as ecological filters gains prominence in urban contexts. Bolund et al (1999) highlight the role of wetlands in air filtration, an aspect often overlooked. Vegetation within wetlands absorbs pollutants, contributing to air quality improvement. Scientifically, the process of phytoremediation involves the use of plants to cleanse soil and water from contaminants. This phenomenon, adapted to urban wetlands, underscores their capacity to contribute to the holistic improvement of urban environments. A scientific example of this lies in the ability of certain wetland plant species to absorb heavy metals and toxins, mitigating their impact on surrounding ecosystems. This natural detoxification process not only enhances water quality but also underscores the intricate relationships between wetlands and broader environmental health. One of the remarkable roles of wetlands lies in their contribution to rainwater drainage. Bolund et al (1999) elucidate how wetlands act as porous sponges, absorbing rainwater and facilitating its gradual release. This mechanism stands in contrast to the rapid runoff typical of urban landscapes characterized by concrete and asphalt. The scientific principle at play here is the hydraulic conductivity of wetland soils, allowing them to absorb and transport water. Scientifically, studies have demonstrated the ability of wetlands to reduce the intensity and frequency of urban flooding. In urban planning, the integration of wetlands as natural stormwater management systems has gained traction. These wetland-based solutions, backed by research, offer effective alternatives to traditional stormwater infrastructure, curbing flood risks and enhancing urban resilience. The role of wetlands in sewage treatment holds profound significance. Bolund et al (1999) point to wetlands' capacity to slow down the flow of sewage water, allowing particles to settle out. This natural sedimentation process, facilitated by wetland vegetation, contributes to the purification of water bodies. Scientifically, the interaction between wetland plants and microbial communities leads to the breakdown of organic matter, further enhancing water quality. Wetland-based sewage treatment systems find scientific validation in their ability to remove pollutants through biological and physical processes. Phragmites australis, a wetland plant, has been studied for its ability to absorb nutrients and pollutants from wastewater, effectively contributing to water purification. The exploration of wetlands within urban environments reveals a tapestry of interrelated services that contribute to urban well-being and resilience. Beyond their  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1714  aesthetic allure, wetlands stand as formidable allies in water supply, stormwater management, and pollution reduction. Scientific research underscores the multifunctional nature of wetlands, validating their capacity to mitigate urban challenges and enhance environmental health. Strategic urban planning must consider the conservation and integration of wetlands within urban landscapes. Zoning regulations that prioritize wetland preservation and restoration are pivotal in maintaining the delicate balance between urbanization and ecological well-being. Collaborative efforts between researchers, policymakers, and local communities play a central role in nurturing these aquatic ecosystems and safeguarding their invaluable contributions. In the context of rapid urbanization, urban wetlands offer a harmonious synthesis of ecological vitality and urban functionality. Their role as natural filters, rainwater regulators, and sewage treatment centers underscores their resilience and adaptability. As cities strive for sustainability, wetlands emerge as essential partners in fostering a harmonious coexistence between human activities and the natural world.  Conclusion  In the symphony of urban development, a transformative crescendo is sounding—an impassioned movement to weave the urban tapestry with the threads of nature. This compelling evolution stems from a profound realization: urban nature is not a mere embellishment but a fundamental imperative, a necessity that breathes life into the concrete corridors of our cities. As urban landscapes reach for the sky, the urgency to integrate green spaces, biodiversity, and natural elements grows, signifying a pivotal shift towards holistic wellbeing, ecological vitality, and urban resilience. The notion of urban nature transcends aesthetics, embodying the intricate connections between city dwellers and the ecosystems that coexist within urban boundaries. Parks, forests, wetlands, and verdant rooftops converge to offer more than just scenic reprieve. They provide havens for contemplation, recreation, and communal bonding. Yet, their significance extends far beyond leisure. These pockets of green bestow vital ecological services—air purification, temperature regulation, water management, and habitat provision for diverse species. As our cities grapple with environmental degradation and the strain of urban living, the role of urban nature emerges as pivotal. Research emphatically underscores the transformative impact of urban nature on human wellbeing. These green spaces are not just escapes; they are vital to mental health, stress reduction, cognitive function, and a sense of connection to the natural world—anchors for urban residents in an otherwise turbulent sea of urbanity. Moreover, these spaces catalyze a sense of unity among diverse populations, transcending social divides and providing equitable access to revitalizing environments. Biodiversity, too, finds a home amid the city's rhythm, bolstering urban resilience in the face of climatic shifts. From native flora to pollinators, urban nature is a symphony of life, enhancing cities' stability and adaptability. Urban greenery is also an educational canvas, nurturing curiosity, and stewardship for the environment, nurturing a greener mindset within urban populations. The conservation of urban nature isn't merely a luxury; it's a pressing ecological mandate. As concrete conquers land, native ecosystems stand threatened. The integration of nature into urban planning becomes the crux of preserving these delicate ecosystems and maintaining urban balance. The preservation of biodiversity and the equilibrium of ecosystems are non-negotiable components of urban vitality. This exploration unearths the  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Vol. 1 3 , No. 9, 2023, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2023  1715  amalgamation of design, ecology, sociology, and health, a collaborative endeavor that calls upon diverse disciplines to reimagine urban landscapes. From integrating green corridors to designing harmonious structures, the urban nature movement champions a shared aspiration to reconnect the urban with the natural. In the tapestry of this exploration, this study endeavors to illuminate the intricate facets of urban nature. By delving into the interplay between urban ecosystems and human wellbeing, we aim to provide insights that resonate with urban planners, policymakers, researchers, and advocates. Through research synthesis, case studies, and theoretical frameworks, we hope to deepen the understanding of how urban nature shapes urban experiences, guiding the design of cities that flourish through the symbiotic embrace of urban life and the natural world. This journey aspires to pave the way towards more sustainable, harmonious urban futures where nature's vitality thrives amidst the rhythms of urbanity. The time to weave nature's threads back into the urban tapestry is now, and the symphony it creates is one of resilient harmony.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Unveiling Optimal Urban Nature for Community Wellbeing' provides a comprehensive exploration of the role that urban green spaces play in enhancing community well-being. Its relevance to the claim that 'Urban green spaces enhance community well-being' is underscored by a thorough examination of varying types of urban nature, including parks, forests, and wetlands. These green spaces not only contribute to aesthetic value but serve as critical infrastructure that facilitates social interaction, promotes mental health, and enhances physical activity, all of which are pivotal to overall community well-being.\n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The authors present a systematic approach in correlating urban green spaces with community well-being. They cite multiple studies that directly link the presence of green areas with improved mental health outcomes. The paper emphasizes that urban nature serves as a catalyst for creating inclusive spaces where social interactions proliferate, which further strengthens communal ties and improves psychological health. This is a direct alignment with the claim, as it substantiates that enhanced access to green spaces unequivocally boosts community well-being by creating environments conducive to social well-being and psychological comfort.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed by the researchers includes a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of existing data from various urban studies. This methodological rigor is fundamental, as it allows the synthesis of findings across different contexts and geographical locations. The quality of evidence presented in the paper is rooted in empirical data and reputable research studies, reinforcing the credibility of the claims. The authors articulate key indicators of urban nature's impact on well-being, such as accessibility, design quality, and biodiversity, which are systematically evaluated against documented outcomes in mental health and community interactions. Furthermore, they utilize a mixed-methods approach, incorporating qualitative insights alongside quantitative data, which enriches the analysis and provides multidimensional perspectives on the effects of urban green spaces.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings of this paper are particularly significant in today's rapidly urbanizing world, wherein the necessity of integrating nature within urban planning has reached critical urgency. The authors stress the escalating need for urban planners and policymakers to prioritize green space development as an essential component of urban infrastructure, linking it to long-term sustainability efforts. The significance extends beyond mere recreational value; the findings advocate for the inclusion of green spaces as vital for public health resilience, particularly as cities face increasing challenges related to mental health crises and environmental degradation. The paper also touches on socio-economic factors, suggesting that equitable distribution of green spaces can alleviate disparities in community well-being, thus advocating for holistic urban development strategies.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Despite the robust findings, the paper is not without limitations. One potential bias highlighted is the over-reliance on studies conducted in affluent urban areas, which may not adequately represent the experiences of poorer communities. The capacity of different populations to utilize green spaces varies widely, potentially skewing insights if not critically assessed. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that while the studies referenced provide foundational insights, the dynamic nature of urban environments means that conclusions may not be universally applicable across different cultural and socio-economic contexts. Future research should aim to expand upon this by integrating more diverse case studies that reflect varying urban realities. Moreover, the paper could benefit from longitudinal studies which track changes in community well-being over time as urban green spaces are developed or altered.\n\nOverall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the ongoing discourse surrounding urban planning and public health, particularly in its insistence on the necessity of green spaces for fostering community well-being and resilience against contemporary urban challenges.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Urban green spaces in rapidly urbanizing cities: A socio-economic valuation of Nairobi City, Kenya' offers a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted benefits associated with urban green spaces (UGS) and their critical role in enhancing community well-being, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas like Nairobi.\n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The paper directly supports the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being by presenting empirical evidence of how UGS contributes to health, livability, and overall attractiveness of cities. It outlines various parameters through which these benefits manifest, including improved mental health, physical health, and social cohesion among community members. Urban green spaces are framed as essential for promoting healthier lifestyles by providing accessible areas for physical activity and recreational activities, which are crucial for urban populations increasingly facing sedentary challenges. The assertion that UGS increases the value of cities underscores its importance not only in terms of aesthetics but also as a critical component of socio-economic infrastructure that bolsters community interaction and well-being.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed in the paper includes quantitative and qualitative assessments designed to gauge the socio-economic impact of UGS. Through economic valuation techniques, the study measures users’ willingness to pay for improvements in green spaces, thus encapsulating the intrinsic value perceived by residents. This approach provides robust quantitative data that can be interpreted to gauge the community's valuation of UGS. The balance of qualitative insights, possibly derived from interviews or focus groups, contributes depth to the findings. However, a noteworthy aspect is that while the economic valuation is informative, its reliance on individuals’ self-reported data on willingness to pay may introduce subjectivity, which can skew the understanding of the true valuation of UGS. The research design likely accounts for potential biases by including a diverse demographic sample from various socio-economic backgrounds in Nairobi, thus enriching the findings while providing a nuanced perspective on urban green spaces.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The paper’s findings are significant in several respects. They highlight an increasing recognition of the role of urban green spaces in promoting healthier, cohesive, and sustainable communities. Given the rapid urbanization in cities like Nairobi, identifying the impact of green spaces is crucial for urban planners and policy makers. The sustainable development implications of this research cannot be overstated; as cities grapple with issues of density, pollution, and social fragmentation, the integration of UGS into urban planning becomes paramount. Furthermore, the paper discusses the conflicts between urban development and the preservation of open spaces, noting the undervaluation of UGS benefits. This highlights a critical need for policy interventions that prioritize green spaces within urban development strategies, ultimately fostering environments that support community health and welfare.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: While the study provides valuable insights, it is crucial to address potential limitations. One significant limitation may stem from the specific geographic focus on Nairobi, which could restrict the generalizability of findings to other urban contexts. Different cultural, social, and economic factors may influence perceptions and utilization of UGS in varying cities. Additionally, the conflict between urban development and UGS preservation highlighted in the paper suggests underlying systemic issues that may not be fully captured in the study. The tension between economic growth and environmental sustainability is complex, and while UGS offers numerous benefits, the feasibility of implementing such spaces often encounters significant infrastructural and political challenges. Furthermore, potential biases may arise from the selective participation of respondents in willingness-to-pay assessments, possibly favoring those with a vested interest or a favorable economically-oriented view of UGS.",

        "abstract": "Background: Greenspaces contribute positively to mental and physical well-being, promote social cohesion, and alleviate environmental stressors, such as air pollution. Ecological studies suggest that greenspace may affect incidence and severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: This study examines the association between residential greenspace and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death. Method: In this retrospective cohort based on patient records from the Greater Manchester Care Records, all first COVID-19 cases diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2022 were followed until COVID-19 related hospitalization or death within 28 days. Residential greenspace availability was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index per lower super output area in Greater Manchester. The association of greenspace with COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models after adjusting for potential individual, temporal, and spatial confounders. We explored potential effect modifications of the associations with greenspace and COVID-19 severity by age, sex, body mass index, smoking, deprivation, and certain comorbidities. Combined effects of greenspace and air pollution (NO2 and PM2.5) were investigated by mutually adjusting pairs with correlation coefficients ≤ 0·7. Results: Significant negative associations were observed between greenspace availability and COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality with odds ratios [OR] (95 % Confidence Intervals [CI]) of 0·96 (0·94-0·97) and 0·84 (0·80-0·88) (per interquartile range [IQR]), respectively. These were significantly modified by deprivation (P-value for interaction < 0.05), showing that those most deprived obtained largest benefits from greenspace. Inclusion of NO2 and PM2.5 diminished associations to null for COVID-19 hospitalization, but only reduced them slightly for mortality, where inverse associations remained. Conclusion: In the Greater Manchester area, residential greenspace is associated with reduced risk of hospitalization or death in individuals with COVID-19, with deprived groups obtaining the greatest benefits. Associations were strongest for COVID-19 mortality, which were robust to inclusion of air pollutants in the models.",

          "The results of our cohort study indicate that residential greenspace is associated with reduced COVID-19 severity. Our analysis suggests that those living in areas with more extensive greenspaces had milder disease outcomes, underscoring the protective health benefits that such environments provide, especially during major health crises.",
          "Our findings highlight that lower socio-economic groups experience the greatest advantages associated with increased greenspace, revealing that access to nature and green environments is not just a luxury for the affluent but a necessary aspect of community health, particularly in densely populated urban areas.",
          "Limitations of this study include its observational nature and the reliance on existing datasets. While we were able to control for multiple potential confounders, we acknowledge the challenges in drawing causal inferences and the potential for unmeasured variables to influence our results.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Residential greenspace and COVID-19 severity: A cohort study of 313,657 individuals in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom' presents a compelling examination of how residential greenspace correlates with COVID-19 severity, which has broader implications for understanding the role of urban green spaces in enhancing community well-being. The study demonstrates that individuals living in areas with higher levels of greenspace exhibited reduced severity of COVID-19, suggesting that greenspaces may contribute to better health outcomes during public health crises. This aligns directly with the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being, as it highlights the protective health benefits provided by these environments, especially during a pandemic. \n\nThe methodology employed in this study is robust, utilizing a large cohort comprised of 313,657 individuals from Greater Manchester, thereby ensuring a diverse population and enhancing the reliability of the findings. The researchers employed regression models to analyze the relationship between greenspace exposure and COVID-19 severity outcomes, accounting for various socio-economic and demographic factors. This methodological rigor adds strength to the evidence, mitigating potential confounding overlaps and biases. The clarity in the statistical analyses and inclusion of various covariates reflects a sophisticated approach to understanding the complex interplay of environmental factors and health outcomes.\n\nThe significance of the findings is twofold. First, it reiterates the crucial role of greenspaces not only in promoting general health and well-being but also in providing specific benefits in crisis scenarios. It highlights that deprived communities, who often have less access to greenspace, might be the ones to gain the most from increased access to such environments, indicating a critical avenue for public health interventions and urban planning. This insight advocates for policies that prioritize greenspace development, particularly in urban areas with marginalized populations. It suggests that investments in urban green infrastructure could serve as a preventive measure against health disasters, aligning with public health objectives to improve community resilience.\n\nDespite the study's strengths, there are several limitations and potential biases worth noting. While the large sample size enhances the study's validity, the observational nature of this research restricts the ability to infer causation definitively. Additionally, the study focuses solely on COVID-19 severity, which, although significant, does not assess other mental health or quality of life indicators that could further elucidate the relationship between greenspaces and community well-being. Another limitation is the potential for ecological fallacy since the analysis is conducted at a population level, which might mask individual variations in greenspace usage and perceived benefits. Further research utilizing longitudinal designs or experimental frameworks would be beneficial to deepen the understanding of these relationships and develop actionable strategies to integrate greenspaces into health initiatives. Overall, the paper provides a well-grounded case for the importance of urban green spaces in contributing to the overall well-being and health security of communities, especially in times of crisis, reinforcing its relevance to the claim significantly.",

We work together to move the public policy \nagenda towards a conscious embrace of urban agriculture as it affects areas of health, education, \neconomic development, and urban planning.1  Our goal is to broaden the connections between \nadvocates of public health and those of urban agriculture with the objectives of instigating \ncooperative discussion, research, advocacy, and practice. \n \nThe paper presents research on the practical health benefits of farming in the city, with an \nemphasis on studies conducted in North America and Western Europe. The major points include: \n \n• The experience of growing food is correlated with its consumption; the more experience \npeople have growing food, the more likely they are to eat it.  \n• Urban gardening and farming involve city dwellers in healthy, active work and \nrecreation.  \n• Urban agriculture builds safe, healthy, and green environments in neighborhoods, \nschools, and abandoned areas. \n \nAt the 1996 United Nations International Conference on Human Habitats in Istanbul, urban \nagriculture was formally recognized for the first time for its contribution to the health and \nwelfare of fast growing urban populations worldwide.  Since that time, related research, practice, \n                                                 \n1\n Community Food Security Coalition’s North American Urban Agriculture Committee 2003.

One third of the 2 million farms in the United States alone are located within \nmetropolitan areas, and produce 35% of U.S. vegetables, fruit, livestock, poultry, and fish.4 \n \n \nI. Community Health: Nutrition and Food Security \n \nSmall well-tended plots of land can yield surprising amounts of produce.  In a 130-day temperate \ngrowing season, a 10x10 meter plot can provide most of a household’s total yearly vegetable \nneeds, including much of the household’s nutritional requirements for vitamins A, C, and B \ncomplex and iron.5  In many parts of the world, urban food produce augments urban food \nsupplies particularly, but not only, of fruits and vegetables.6  Urban spaces that produce \nsignificant amounts of food include: parks, utility rights-of-way, bodies of water, roof tops, walls \nand fences, balconies, basements and courtyards.7  Urban area food production can operate at a \nfor-profit farm scale, producing high quality fresh foods (including protein-rich production) on \nrelatively small amounts of space that include aquaculture, hydroponics, and greenhouses.8   \n \nDietary Knowledge and Practice \nPractical experience with fresh food – growing, harvesting, identifying varieties in stores and \nfarm stands, understanding seasonality, cooking, and preserving – positively impacts dietary \nhabits.  An allegiance to homegrown and farm-purchased foods develops when we develop the \nskills to transform fresh, raw food into cooked, savory  food.9  This is also an opportune time for \nclinical and extension interventions to promote healthy forms of cooking (e.g., low salt and \nfat).10 \n \nEvidence is building that when gardeners and small-scale farmers “save food dollars” by \nproducing their own food, their overall food consumption patterns and dietary knowledge \nimprove.11  Gardeners generally believe that what they grow is good for them and so they tend to \nthey eat it.12  A number of studies show that the fruit and vegetable intake, as measured in terms \n                                                 \n2\n United Nations World Health Organization, WHO 2001; Bakker et al. 2000; United Nations, FAO 2000; Maxwell \net al. 1998; Smit 1996; Smit et al. 1996. \n3\n Brown and Carter 2003. \n4\n Kaufman and Bailkey 2000; Smit et al. 1996; Sommers and Smit, 1994. \n5\n Patel 1996; Sommers and Smit 1994.  \n6\n (UNFAO), http://www.fao.org/urbanag/default.asp; Smit, et al. 1996; Bellows 1996; Bellows and Hamm 2003. \n7\n Dunnett and Kingsbury 2004; Pilcher 2002. \n8\n Resh 2001; Koc 1999; Smit et al. 1996; Olson 1994; Nicholls 1990. \n9\n Wells and Gradwell 2001; Ohri-Vachaspati and Warrix 1999. \n10\n Martinez-Salgado et al. 1993; Ohri-Vachaspati and Warrix 1999. \n11\n Pothukuchi and Bickes 2001; Pranis 2003. \n12\n Armstrong-A 2000; Lackey & Associates 1998; Patel 1996. \nof recommended servings per day, is higher among gardeners than among non-gardeners in the \nsame study,13 or among gardeners versus the average U.S. consumer14.  In a 1991 study, \ngardeners ate more vegetables more frequently and they consumed less sweet foods and soft \ndrinks as compared to a non-gardener control group.15   \n \nResearch shows that new gardeners increase vegetable more than fruit consumption.16  This may \nbe because vegetables are relatively easy to grow, benefiting the U.S. diet that particularly lacks \nleafy green and yellow vegetables.17  Fruits generally take more room and time to grow than do \nvegetables.  Berries, however, can be somewhat simpler to introduce than orchard crops, thus \nproviding the fruit sub-group identified as most underrepresented in the U.S. diet.18  “Truck \nfarming” traditionally exists in peri-urban environments and specializes in those under-consumed \nfoods, the leafy greens, yellow vegetables, and berries.  Farms on the urban fringe are threatened \nby development.  The potential loss of the farms and their capacity to supply the nutritional \nneeds of concentrated urban populations should be of concern to health practitioners. \n \nLand and water livestock provide existing and potential protein resources for urban area \npopulations. The production of pasture and free range poultry is increasing within daily delivery \nof urban centers and mobile poultry processing plants are becoming more common. Urban \nproduction, processing, and distribution of micro- and small-scale livestock – including goat, \nsheep, and rabbit -- is increasing rapidly.  Farm fish was the most rapidly growing industry in the \nworld during the 1990s and much of that growth was in and near cities.19  \n \nNutrition education through gardening enjoys documented success in changing dietary practice \namong seniors.20  Public sector advocates of nutritional health encourage: a) day care workers to \nintroduce gardening to boost young children’s dietary habits21; and b) community groups to start \ncommunity gardening projects for over all health planning and self-care22.  \n \nHome gardening and nutrition education has been shown to boost micro-nutrient intake in many \ncountries and can be considered as additional intervention models applicable to the North \nAmerican region.  Studies describe nutrition education programs that include home gardening \ncomponents to balance diets and variously boost serum retinol, vitamin A, iron, and iodine in \nrural South Africa23, India24, Bangladesh25, Indonesia26, Mexico27, and The Philippines28.   \n                                                 \n13\n Armstrong-A 2000; Lackey & Associates 1998; Pothukuchi and Bickes 2001. \n14\n Giordano et al. 1998. \n15\n Blair et al. 1991.

Limited income households, \nhowever, tend to focus their buying power on bulk foods that fill them up.29   Community and \nresidential gardening, as well as small-scale farming, save household food dollars.  They \npromote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items30.    Studies report that \nevery $1 invested in a community garden plot yields approximately $6 worth of vegetables.31  \nAn average urban garden in 1991 produced about $160 worth of produce.32  A 1996 study claims \nthat 1,900 gardens in community lots on 30 acres in Newark produced approximately $915,000 \nof food value in one year and almost $4 million over 5 years.33 \n \nEmergency food providers typically have relatively greater access to breads, cereals, and canned \ngoods and suffer a chronic shortage of fresh fruits and vegetables and of proteins (fish, fowl, and \nmeat; fresh, frozen, and canned).34  Through garden donation projects like Plant-a-Row, urban \nfood production saves food bank resources required to obtain needed food and further, provides \nprecisely those foods rarely donated by retailers, restaurants, processors, and other suppliers.35  \n \nFresh and Local \nNumerous studies show that gardeners and those who buy directly from local farmers identify \nwanting fresh produce as an important reason why they grow their own food and purchase \nlocally grown products.36 This is partly a function of taste, which some name as the most \nimportant lever to increase fruit and vegetable consumption.37  The full-sensory experience of \neating fresh-picked produce and/or the activity of producing vegetables appears to enhance fruit \nand vegetable consumption among some ethnic groups.38  Studies that report relationships \nbetween freshness and health are beginning to appear in the literature.  For example, it has been \nshown that a 5-10 day transportation and storage lag between production and consumption leads \nto losses of 30-50% in some nutritional constituents.39 \n \nGardeners report that they increase their fresh produce consumption because the same foods they \ngrow are not (equally) accessible to them for many different reasons: the retail price is too high; \nlocal stores offer inadequate selections of produce; the food they grow and prefer has an ethnic \nor regional character that is not available at local stores.40  When farmers and consumers meet \nface-to-face they learn about each other’s needs, for example, the desire for vegetables not \ncommonly available.  Direct marketing improves the producer-consumer relationship and \nmaximizes opportunities and interest in increased consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. \n                                                 \n29\n Lin et al. 2005; Drewnowski and Spencer 2004; Levine et al. 2003; Morgan et al. 1985; Peterkin and Hama 1983. \n30\n Kaufman and Bailkey 2000; Herbach 1998; Lackey & Associates 1998; Sommers and Smit 1994. \n31\n Hynes 1996. \n32\n Blair et al. 1991. \n33\n Patel 1996. \n34\n Poppendieck 1999. \n35\n Wilson 2001. \n36\n Armstrong-A 2000; Giordano et al. 1998; Hanna 1999; Lackey & Associates 1998; Patel 1996; Patel 1991; \nRamirez 1995; Salvidar-Tanaka 2002. \n37\n Morris et al. 2001. \n38\n Devine et al. 1999. \n39\n Shewfelt, RL 1990a, 1990b; Klein 1987. \n40\n Salvidar-Tanaka 2002; Hanna 1999;  Hynes 1996; Feenstra et al. 1999; Ramirez 1995. \n Community Food Security \nUrban agriculture contributes to community food security.41  Times of war and conflict render \ntenuous our dependence on distant food sources, especially in this post-9/11 world.42  A local \nagri-food system provides a relatively secure and more locally controlled source of food.  Better \ninteraction between local consumers and farmers increases awareness of local food options.  \nEnhanced communication also augments knowledge and commitment to healthy, sustainable, \nand secure food products and practices.43 \n \nUrban gardening contributes to local food security.  Gardeners report that sharing food with \nfriends, families, neighbors, and/or needy members of their community in need is one of the \nimportant reasons that they grow produce.44  This generosity has been organized into programs \nthat maximize contributions to soup kitchens and pantries, for example, through the “plant-a-\nrow” project that encourages gardeners to set aside a specific space for donations.45 \n \nStrategies to buy locally have surged.46  States and regions have instituted “buy local” policies.47  \nCommunity supported agriculture (CSA) has linked buyer collectives with local farmers; some \nCSAs strive to make opportunities available to low-income groups.48  Local farmers are in such \ndemand that many large and small towns now compete to have farmers participate in their \nfarmers markets.49   Low income group access to fresh and local produce is increasingly \naddressed.50  U.S. federal programs encourage direct marketing of fresh produce through farm \nstands and farmers markets. Many of these programs also incorporate voucher and electronic \nbenefits transfer (EBT) redemption programs51 at the markets to augment fruit and vegetable \nconsumption in vulnerable population groups -- seniors, low-income, and single parent families.  \nThrough donations and gleaning opportunities, urban area farmers contribute to urban food \nbanks and emergency food assistance programs.52  \n \nII. Community Health: Lifelong Active Lifestyles and Personal Wellness \n \nUrban agriculture benefits both individuals and neighborhoods, and thus contributes to overall \ncommunity health.53  The benefits of food production transcend the physical, mental and \nemotional health of the individual to leave lasting change on others and on the physical and \n                                                 \n41\n Koc et al. 1999;\u0001Bellows and Hamm 2003; Hamm and Bellows 2003; Mann 2001. \n42\n Wilkins 2004; United States Food and Drug Administration 2003, http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/fssrep.html.  \n43\n Cohen et al. 2004. \n44\n Saldivar-Tanaka 2003; Von Hassell 2002; Hanna 1999; Giordano and Tam 1998; Patel 1996; Hynes 1996. \n45\n “Plant-a-Row” Project; http://www.gardenwriters.org/par/\u0002 \n46\n Hinrichs and Lyson (eds., Forthcoming). \n47\n Barham 2003, http://www.state.nj.us/jerseyfresh/. \n48\n Hunger Action Network of New York State 2005, 2004. \n49\n Knox and Feenstra 2004 (working draft); Gradwell, et al.

It is associated with satisfying labor, physical and mental relaxation, \nsocializing, and a means to produce food and beauty.  Used well, gardening can be a key element \nin successful health intervention programs because it addresses simultaneously the physical, \nmental, spiritual, and social health of individuals and their communities.55   \n \nFor many, farming is a labor of love as well as a source of income.  In recognition of the \nfinancial potential of farming, a number of programs now exist to expand opportunities to new \nfarmers – many of whom are based in peri-urban environments – who have difficulty with start \nup costs.  These programs promote community wellness: clean, open space landscapes, access to \nlocal fresh foods, and healthy local economies with local economic multiplier effects.  Some \nprograms specifically target immigrant communities, many of whose members come to North \nAmerica with extensive farming knowledge and experience.  These individuals often find great \npersonal satisfaction in returning to farm operations and they typically grow crops and raise \nlivestock wanted by their ethnic peers; foods that may otherwise be difficult to find.56 \n \nExercise \nGardening and food production is good exercise.  Health professionals and others, however, \noften undervalue its exercise-related health benefits.  Garden enthusiasts and farmers themselves \nrarely compartmentalize their labors as “exercise.”  The “exercise” ranges from fine motor \ninvolvement when cutting flowers, to aerobic gross motor tasks such as turning compost piles.57 \nGardeners report that garden “activity” increases self-esteem, pride, confidence, personal \nsatisfaction, and efficacy.58 \n \nResearch that addresses gardening generally unravels the holistic advantages of gardening from \n“exercise.”  Many studies bundle walking, bicycling, taking the stairs, and gardening together as \nundervalued forms of exercise.  When self-identified as exercise by research subjects or isolated \nby researchers, gardening has been connected to reducing risks of obesity (children and adults)59, \ncoronary heart disease (for women and for men, notably menopausal women and elderly \nmales),60 glycemic control and diabetes (adults, elderly men, Mexicans and Mexican-\nAmericans)61, and occupational injuries (railway workers).62 \n \nGardening can expend little or intensive amounts of energy.  Even moderate forms of garden \nexercise increase muscle strength and endurance in activity-reduced persons including pregnant \n                                                 \n54Shoemaker and Kiehl 2002; Littman 1996; Brogan and James 1980. \n55\n Armstrong-B 2000; Herbach 1998; Hynes 1996. \n56\n Growing New Farmers, http://gnf.bigmindcatalyst.com/cgi/bmc.pl?page=pubpg1.html&node=1010; World \nHunger Year, Food Security Learning Center, http://www.worldhungeryear.org/fslc/; New England LAND LINK, \nhttp://www.smallfarm.org/nell/nell.html.  \n57\n Brown and Jameton 2000. \n58\n Hanna and Oh 2000; Waliczek et al. 1996.  \n59\n Reynolds and Anderson 2004; Kien and Chiodo 2003. \n60\n Beitz and Doren  2004; Reynolds and Anderson 2004; Lemaitre et al. 1999; Pols et al. 1997; Grimes et al. 1996; \nHaines et al. 1992; Caspersen et al. 1991; Magnus et al. 1980; Magnus et al. 1979. \n61\n Wood 2004; Reynolds and Anderson 2004; Van Dam et al. 2002. \n62\n Chau et al. 2004. \nwomen, cancer survivors, and those generally sedentary.63  Gardening and nature-adventure \neducation in after-school programs increased energy expenditures of 12 year olds by 60 \npercent.64 \n \nResearch shows that gardening is a preferred form of exercise across age, gender, and ethnicity.65  \nOverall, older persons do more gardening than younger ones.66  Research does not always \ncapture gardening as exercise, because some gardeners perceive it as part of a day’s leisure or \nlabor activities and not a separate activity in the category of “exercise.”  In one study, men \nidentified gardening as “exercise” more often than did women though women and men reported \nsimilar amounts of time gardening.67 Many women may associate gardening with gendered \nhousehold food-related chores rather than exercise. \n \nThe beneficial effects of outdoor activity and exposure to sunlight need more research. Sunlight \ncould influence susceptibility to a number of chronic diseases.  For example, sunlight deficiency \nmay increase blood cholesterol.  One study shows that gardening is associated with lower blood \ncholesterol during the summer growing season but not in the winter.68  \n \nMental Health \nWorking with plants and in the outdoors benefits the mental health, mental outlook, and personal \nwellness of individuals.69  Cultivation activities trigger both illness prevention and healing \nresponses.  Health professionals use plants and gardening materials to help patients of diverse \nages with mental illness improve social skills, self-esteem, and use of leisure time.70  The field of \nhorticulture therapy promotes plant-human relationships to induce relaxation and to reduce \nstress, fear and anger, blood pressure, and muscle tension.71  Given the literature on positive \noutcomes of plant-human relationships, the American Community Gardening Association has \nexpressed surprise that more gardens have not been dedicated to mental health and rehabilitative \nintervention.72 \n \n \nIII. Community Health: Building Safe, Healthy, and Green Environments \n \nUrban environments have the capacity to integrate our need to live in a balance of built and open \nspaces.  Constructing green zones is important for a robust city as building housing, service \ninfrastructure, and industrial and commercial spaces.  Community and educational land \ndedicated to food production encourages participation in the vigor of a positive urban \n                                                 \n63\n Evenson KR, et al. 2004; Irwin 2004; Rolland et al. 2004; Wannamethee and Shaper 2001; Wannamethee et al. \n2000; Anonomous-B 1995. \n64\n Kien and Chiodo 2003. \n65\n Wood 2002; Crespo et al. 1996. \n66\n Wood 2002; cf.

The practice of cultivation improves the urban physical environments as measured \nby air quality, range of bio-diversity, and soil quality. \n \nSocial Life in Urban Neighborhoods \nGardens and farms enhance the informal and the formal economies of social environment The \neffort to develop and sustain urban food production inside cities builds social capital – trust, civic \nengagement, the development of community leaders, and the sharing of goods (“vegetable \ncapital”), services, and information.73  Bringing people together, building community, and \nimproving neighborhoods are some of the reasons gardening empowers its participants.74  Social \nengagement is positively correlated with personal attention to health care and wellness.75  Food \nproduction teaches job skills and offers entrepreneurial opportunities.76  Reports find that low-\nincome communities particularly value the community building benefits of urban agriculture.77  \nInnovative prison garden programs strive to improve personal health and mental outlook through \npride in nurturing the life of a garden and understanding and connecting nutrition and bodily \nself-respect.78 \n \nUrban community gardens and farms help overcome social, health, and environmental justice \nchallenges.79  Safe and pleasant neighborhoods promote active lifestyles and outdoor exercise \nthat counteract the physical passivity associated with the obesity epidemic.  Participating in \nbeautifying a neighborhood builds a constructive, collective consciousness. The presence of \nvegetable gardens in inner-city neighborhoods is positively correlated with decreases in crime, \ntrash dumping, juvenile delinquency, fires, violent deaths, and mental illness.80  Gardens link \ndifferent sectors of a city—youth, elders, and diverse race, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.81  \nGardeners, especially older ones, feel safe and have a purpose for leaving their households and \nengaging in a wider landscape; they literally and figuratively broaden their horizons.82  Adults \nfeel more secure allowing young persons to move freely in safe, green, cared-for, and populated \nenvironments. \n \nUrban Agriculture in Schools \nExtensive and mounting evidence shows that school-based garden programs have significant \nhealth effects on young people.  In these non-traditional learning labs, youth become familiar \nwith good and healthy food, especially the fruits and vegetables critical to reducing obesity and \nchronic diseases.  It is precisely these foods that are missing from our children’s usual diets.  \nSchool garden programs teach a skill and a lifetime hobby that provides exercise, mental \nstimulation, and social interactions.  Children receive practical entrees to biological and \n                                                 \n73\n Hinrichs and Lyson (Forthcoming); Lyson 2004; Von Hassell 2002; Feenstra et al. 1999; McGuinn and Relf 2001; \nOh 1999; Littman 1996; Lewis 1991. \n74\n McGuinn and Relf 2001; Hanna 2000; Feenstra et al. 1999; Kuo et al. 1998a; Kuo et al. 1998b; Lewis 1991; Blair \net al. 1991. \n75\n Greenberg and Schneider 1996.  \n76\n Halweil 2005; Kaufman and Bailkey 2000; Feenstra et al. 1999; Francis et al. 1994.  \n77\n Armstrong-A 2000. \n78\n Sneed 1998; Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, \nhttp://www.hms.harvard.edu/chase/projects/chicago/index.html.. \n79\n Von Hassell 2002. \n80\n Hurley 2004; Patel 2003; McKay 1998. \n81\n Predny and Relf 2000; Feenstra et al. 1999; The Food Project, http://www.thefoodproject.org/. \n82\n Milligan et al. 2004.  \nenvironmental sciences, math, geography, and social studies.  Additionally, reports show that \nthese advantages accrue to students that have trouble succeeding in school as well as those who \nexcel.83 \n \nFarm-to-school and farm-to–college programs establish market relationships with local farms to \nsecure the freshest and in season fruits, vegetables, and other products for consumption in school \nand college cafeterias.  These programs reflect a grassroots endeavor by parents, teachers, school \nhealth officials, students, farmers, and others.  Their efforts counter a trend to offer students fast \nfood and highly processed menus in schools –the very foods linked to the obesity epidemic.  At \nthe national, state, and municipal levels, the public sector is joining grassroots organizers to \ndevelop policy and pass legislation to enable and promote farm-to-school or farm-to-college \nprograms.84 \n \nA schoolyard garden can deliver produce to its school’s cafeteria in order to provide an \nexceedingly dynamic linkage between nutrition, education, and learned behaviors.  Such a \nprogram exists in the Berkeley, California school system and represents a progression from \nalready functioning schoolyard gardens and a successful farm-to-school program to new \ncurriculum development that benefits the health and education of its students.85 \n \nGrowing Urban Green Zones \nGardeners and farmers “create nature” and enjoy being “in nature” within urban built \nenvironments.  They work hard to improve the physical environment of their neighborhoods and \ncommunities.86  The beauty gardeners develop enhances their physical environment that in turn \nadvances gardeners’ psychosocial87 as well as physical health.  One study found that access to \ngardens, along with improved housing fixtures and dwelling type, location and adequacy of \nhousing space was positively associated with how respondents self-assessed their health.88 \n \nUrban area gardens and farms improve air quality.  On the local level, plant foliage reduces \ncarbon dioxide, ozone concentrations (heavy, low-lying gas), and lowers urban mass \ntemperatures.89  On a more macro scale, locally grown food reduces the present average of 1300 \n                                                 \n83\n French SA, Wechsler H.  2004; Kien &  Chiodo. 2003; Pranis 2003; Morris et al. 2002; Morris et al. 2001; Morris \net al. 2000;  Pothukuchi and Bickes 2001; Lineberger and Zajicek 2000; Predny and Relf 2000; Bellows 2004; \nTexas Department of Human Resources 1981.

They attract beneficial soil \nmicroorganisms, insects, birds, reptiles, and animals.  Gardens play a role in species preservation \nfor birds and butterflies by providing food, resting spaces, and protection along migratory flight \npaths.91 \n \nUrban food production improves urban and urban fringe soils.  Rooted plants stabilize the \nground and reduce soil erosion.  Cared-for soils absorb rainfall that then does not run over \nexposed, compacted dirt and pavement absorbing toxic debris and dumping it into storm drains.  \nUrban compost systems can transform significant amounts of a city’s waste (organic waste from \nyards, parks, food establishments, etc.) for beneficial re-use.92 \n \n \nIV. Community Health: Planning for Potential Health Risks \n \nHeavy Metals \nMany urban residents are challenged by soils containing toxic levels of heavy metals including \nlead, cadmium, mercury, nickel, and copper.  The type of heavy metal depends on the source: \npaint, gas or oil, waste incineration, lead pipes, specific industries, etc.  Dangers include direct \nabsorption of toxics through ingestion (breathing and swallowing, the latter especially by \nchildren with their hands in their mouths) and indirect consumption through foods grown on the \nland that may have absorbed the toxics.  Particularly in older cities, it is crucial to test soils for \nlead before growing food or even before allowing small children to enter and play in the garden \nspaces.   \n \nAppropriate gardening practices reduce risk.  Strategies include: 1) improving soil stability \nthrough crop plantings and soil amendments like mulch, thereby reducing wind-born dust and the \ntracking of contaminated soils into residences by human feet and household pets; 2) emphasizing \nthe cultivation of fruiting plants (including vegetables like peppers and eggplants) rather than \ngreen leafy vegetables and tubers because the latter absorb heavy metals about ten times faster \nthan do fruiting plants; 3) adding compost and/or calcium to the soil to lower soil acidity and \nthus reducing the potential of metal “uptake” by plants; 4) growing ornamentals (for beauty, \nexercise, healthy cities) and not edibles; 5) using phytoremediation whereby highly absorptive \nplants are cultivated to “take up” heavy metals from the soils (This practice is, however, \nproblematic in terms of disposal of contaminated plants).  Raised beds, container gardens, and \nhydroponics additionally circumvent many contamination problems.93 \n                                                 \n90\n Jules et al. 2005; Roberts 2005; Pirog and Benjamin 2003; Jones 2002. \n91\n Towle1996; Biodiversity Science Assessment Team 1994; The BUGS Project, Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in \nSheffield, http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/bugs/; Urban Biodiversity; Urban Ecology and Urban Sustainable \nEnvironment, http://bch-cbd.naturalsciences.be/belgium/links/themes/urban.htm. \n92\n Locke 2004; BioCycle 1999; San Francisco, Department of Environment, Composting Page, \nhttp://temp.sfgov.org/sfenvironment/aboutus/recycling/compost.htm; California, Food Scraps Management, \nhttp://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/foodwaste/. \n93\n Hamel and Heckman 2003; Lock and Veenhuizen 2001; Litt et al. 2002; Xintaras 1992; Bellows 2000; Bellows \n1999; Bellows 1996; US Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, CDC 1991; Lepp 1981. \n Air pollution \nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a known carcinogen, have been found in urban soils.  \nPAHs are residues from incomplete combustion.  They may exist in gardens and other urban \nsoils due to vehicle pollution from adjacent roads and railways, past wood or coal burning on or \nnear the site, or the extensive use of creosote railroad ties as garden plot dividers during the \n1970s & 80s.  Little is known about them, but basic research has begun.94 \n \nOther Potential Risks \nOther potential risks associated with urban gardening and farming require common sense \nstrategies.  Standing water can attract bugs, including mosquitoes carrying diseases like West \nNile virus.  Gardens and farms that rely on water catchment systems need to take simple \nprecautions like covering standing water or seeking access to public water mains.  Use of \nincompletely composted animal manures can spread diseases, however proper composting is \nsimple to learn and implement.  Standard and common sense safety measures are necessary with \nthe use of heavy or sharp garden tools, especially around small children. Proper ergonomic use \nof tools lessens the risk of muscle strain.  Reducing exposure from direct sunlight (hats, sun \nblock, less gardening in the middle of the day) protects from sunburn and vulnerability to skin \ncancer. \n \n \nRecommendations for Health Professionals \n \nHealth professionals can increase the positive benefits of urban agriculture in many ways.  Here \nare a few suggestions: \n• Cultivate a Healing Garden on idle land at your health department, medical office, \nhospital, or long-term care facility.  The garden will provide serenity, food, and education \nabout the therapeutic and preventative benefits of specific vegetables and of gardening. \n• Encourage patients/clients to grow their own vegetables at home, as a therapeutic means \nfor enhancing nutrition, physical exercise, and relaxation. \n• Encourage patients/clients to shop at farmers’ markets and/or join a vegetable-box \nsubscription (sometimes called a Community Supported Agriculture, CSA) program to \nincrease their access to fresh vegetables and fruits, and to support local farmers. \n• Introduce the subject of public health and urban agriculture to your professional \nassociation to exchange ideas and find out what your colleagues know about the subject. \n• Work with local planners and policy makers to establish new community gardens, \npreserve open space and market structures that secure urban food production in and near \nurban areas. \n• Encourage State health departments to adopt the option of WIC redemptions at farmers \nmarkets and CSAs. \n• Encourage local farmers markets and CSAs to incorporate mechanisms and support to \naccept emergency food assistance including food stamp benefits through EBT, and WIC \nand Senior FMNP coupons. \n                                                 \n94\n Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts69.html \n• Provide financial support for community-based gardening projects such as youth garden \ninitiatives and community gardening. \n• Support the national 'farm to school' movement. \n• Envision and help to plan and implement a local farms-to-hospital program. \n• Support a ''Garden at every school\" program like the successful model in California. \n• Support 'edible buildings', green building' and 'vertical agriculture' programs. \n• Join the Community Food Security Coalition to partner with the broad swath of active \nand engaged food and nutrition practitioners dedicated to building strong, sustainable, \nlocal and regional food systems that ensure access to affordable, nutritious, and culturally \nappropriate food for all people at all times.  \n \nFor more information contact: \nCommunity Food Security Coalition \nPO Box 209 \nVenice CA  90294 \nwww.foodsecurity.org \n310-822-5410 \nBibliography \n \nAhmed F. 1999. “Vitamin A deficiency in Bangladesh: a review and recommendations for \nimprovement.” Public Health Nutrition. 2(1):1-14, Mar. \n \nAkbari, H, J Huang, P Martien, L Rainer, A Rosenfeld, H Taha. 1988. “The impact of summer \nheat islands on cooling energy consumption and CO2 emissions.” in Proceedings of the 1988 \nSummer Study in Energy Efficiency in Buildings.

This study examines the socio-economics of urban crop on municipal lands, cultivators’ views and perceptions on the use of urban space for agricultural activities and related issues in Harare, Zimbabwe. Urban agriculture is used for subsistence maize production. It improves food grain availability, thus increasing household food security and real incomes available for other household requirements as contributes to savings on food expenditure. This is the incentive for cultivation on undeveloped urban land spaces. The study gives empirical insight on the uses of urban space for agricultural activities from the cultivators' perspectives. The findings of the study also show that there is a serious problem of lack of concern for the environment on the part of the cultivators. The majority of the cultivators were aware of but ignored the steam bank regulations. There was general lack of knowledge about the environmental effects of cultivation on the urban environment.

IntroductionCrop production and livestock keeping are part of the food security system in the urban areas of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They directly provide food and indirectly generate household cash income. A study by Drescher (1994) revealed that close to 40 percent of households in Lusaka, Zambia, relied on the urban environment to gather, or grow, food for home consumption and sale. Lee-Smith (1991) reported that a 1985 study in Nairobi, Kenya, showed that 29 percent of Nairobi households grew craps and 17 percent raised livestock with a total value of US$17 million. In 1991 Mbiba assessed urban agriculture comprising of dairy cows, maize, sheep and pigs in Maseru, Lesotho, at close to US$13 million (Mbiba, 1995).Work in Lusaka by Rakodi (1987) and Sanyal (1987), Mosha (1991) in Tanzania and Freeman (1992) in Nairobi underscored the importance of urban agriculture as source of food and income for low-income households. Mudimu and Chigume (1993) measured the contribution of cultivation on open spaces to household food security and cash income in the City of Harare, Zimbabwe. Maize from these sources provided grain that lasted up to 4 months for some of the households. These translated into savings on household food expenditure (maize grain purchases) of up to US$15 per month. This is substantial for households whose breadwinners are on minimum wage of US$100-250 per month and facing food basket needs of US$20-40 per month.The advent of economic reforms, in the mid-1980, led to removal of subsidies on food commodities and retrenchments in the formal employment sectors. These have, in turn, contributed to fall in real incomes and a reduced food security status of many urban households.The vulnerable households have resorted to urban agriculture to grow food crops to sustain their livelihood.Despite being a widespread practice and its importance, urban agriculture is not considered a legitimate form of urban land use, thus it is not planned for, nor supported by urban planners and managers (Rogerson, 1993; Mbiba, 1994). The reaction of local authorities has been repressive especially in Eastern and Southern Africa (Mbiba, 1994).Urban agriculture is an issue of debate due to the different perceptions and interpretations of its value and importance by urban planners and managers versus those engaged in the activity. Conflicts in urban land use for food production arise from the different perceptions and interpretations of its value and importance by urban planners and managers versus those engaged in the activity. The former do not recognised it as a legitimate use of the urban environment (Mazambani, 1982). Urban agriculture has not therefore been incorporated in urban planning and neither is it supported (Lee-Smith and Trujilo, 1992, Rogers, 1993). It comes into conflict with the provisions of urban space planning and management. Repressive measures were often adopted to control the situation as illustrated by the actions of the Harare City Council prior to 1992 and other cases reported by Freeman (1991), Lee-Smith and Trujilo (1992), and Mbiba (1995). Those involved in urban agriculture contend that it provides an opportunity for households to improve availability of own produced foods and cash income.This paper contributes to previous research on urban agriculture in Harare. Its contribution is to empirically measure the economics of urban agriculture, linkages with the economic structural adjustment programme (ESAP) and assess the views of the cultivators on the areas of conflicts and attitudes towards urban agriculture.The paper has seven sections, inclusive of the introduction. The second section discusses the issues of urban agriculture in Harare. The third and fourth sections report the findings of the case study that examines the contribution of urban agriculture to urban population’s strategy to maintain household food and cash income security in the environment of economic reforms. The linkage between economic reforms and increase in cultivation on urban spaces is presented in section five. Section six presents the cultivators’ views on urban agriculture, alternative land use and their awareness of environmental issues. The last section synthesizes the issues.2. Urban Agriculture in HarareUrban Harare covers 55 600 hectares, of which about 10 000 hectares are undeveloped residential and industrial lands and open lands (Mazambani, 1982). The open lands include stream banks, wet lands (which are regulated by the Natural Resources Act of 1975), road and rail reserves and land reserved for recreational and other purposes. It is estimated that 50-60 percent of the undeveloped and open land is under cultivation (Masoka, 1995). Between 1950 and 1980, the area under cultivation increased by 68 percent (Mazambani, 1982) and by 93 percent between 1990 and 1994 (Masoka, 1995). This massive increase is attributed to a number of factors. One factor is the rapid urban population growth since 1980. A second factor is the worsening economic conditions from the mid-1980s coupled with a general increase in commodity prices, especially food. The practice of urban agriculture increased markedly during the post-1991 years due to the economic hardships brought about by the economic structural adjustment programme initiated in 1991. This included cost recovery measures in health and education. These hardships resulted in many urban families turning to urban cultivation as an alternative source of food, to save on food expenditure and raise cash income.2.1 Rules, Regulations on Urban AgricultureThe Regional Town and Country Planning Act that governs urban planning and management refer to urban agriculture as one of the development activities that is subject to control through statutory instruments. The Urban Council Act, that governs local authorities, gives the2responsible minister discretion to make regulations pertaining to cultivated urban lands. It, however, does not necessarily prohibit urban agriculture. The Act gives power to the responsible minister to clear crops when they are likely to cause fire, or health problems, or if they are unsightly. All these are subjective. Both Acts do not necessarily prohibit urban cultivation on open spaces in the cities.There is no clear policy against, or in support, or plans relating to urban agriculture of urban agriculture. Past control measures such as slashing of crops were justified on the basis of the Natural Resource Act that controls, or prohibits, cultivation inside 30 metres of riverbanks, or other waterways.2.2 Land Use Conflicts and Environmental IssuesLocal authorities view urban agriculture as demanding a significant proportion of cities’ land and having negative environmental and health impacts. The general attitude has been either to deter or to stop the agricultural activity from continuing. The reasons given include: (a) soil erosion which eventually results in silting water sources; (b) negating the provision of open areas which should be used for recreation by residents, (c) re-pegging areas because the boundary pegs were removed by cultivators and (d) the arguments that tall maize plants provide hideaway for muggers. Bowyer-Bower and Tengbeh (1995) measured the environmental effects of urban agriculture on the environment of Harare. They assessed that in cultivated areas the infiltration of rainwater into the soil was reduced on average by 28.5 percent. Soil loss in cultivated lands ranged from 2.5 to 13.7 tonnes per hectare per year, depending on soil type. Cultivation of open spaces and wet lands contributed to loss or change in spatial diversity of species habitat of over 80 percent, reduction of ecological diversity and contributed to a 55 percent loss in tree presence in Harare (Bowyer-Bower and Tengbeh, 1995). These changes contributed to some decline in the aesthetic quality of urban space. All the above changes impact negatively on quality of urban life and increase costs of urban management.Those involved in urban agriculture contend that it provides opportunities for households to improve availability of own produced foods and cash income and reduces the vulnerability of women and children to food insecurity and negative impacts of the economic reforms (Mbiba, 1995). Most participants are low-income urban residents who grow crops to supplement disposable incomes through savings in food purchases. This frees their budgets for other household needs. In addition, it contributes to better family nutrition that would not have been possible if the family purchased all requirements from the market. Improved nutrition contributes to better family health. It could therefore be argued that if cultivators had more influence on urban land use planning in local authorities, they would make provisions for urban cultivation.2.3 City Council Control ApproachesThe City Council of Harare mounted a campaign against urban agriculture and slashed maturing crops, in 1990 and 1991, in an attempt to stop agricultural activities. The response of the cultivators, the majority who were women, was to fight what they considered to be a colonial and male attitude to city planning with regard to alternative urban land uses. This opposition was articulated as a political and economic battle The women mobilised themselves to lobby their local city councillors and their constituent Members of Parliament for a general change in attitude towards urban agriculture. They contended that they needed the land to grow crops to supplement incomes and food supplies. In their view the open and undeveloped urban lands were under utilised. They resisted and opposed the City Council by continuing their agricultural practice year after year. In response to this persistence and the accompanying political pressure, in 1992 the Harare City Council conceded by allocating some designated land to women operating through organised groups. The groups then formed farming co-operatives. This option gave some residents the right to grow their crops and for the City Council to allocate suitable land and be able to monitor and control the impacts of some urban cultivation. Despite this move, “illegal”, or un-sanctioned, cultivation by both members of co-operatives, who have plots outside the identified co-operative lands, and other individuals, who are not members of co-operatives, has persisted. Over the period 1992 to 1995, there has been extensive expansion in the area under cultivation. The demand for land exceeds the supply.33. Case StudyThe case study analyses the socio-economics of urban cultivation in terms of the cultivators’ socio-economic characteristics, contribution to food security and the examines the cultivators’ views, attitudes and perceptions of the use of the urban space for agricultural activities and related issues. The case study draws from a larger study undertaken in January 1995 to February 1997 to characterise and quantify agricultural activities on open and undeveloped land areas around Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city.3.1 Data Sources3.1.1 Selection of Survey SitesTwo methods were used to select the survey sites. A rapid survey of all the open and undeveloped lands was undertaken to identify the extent of cultivation within the boundaries of Harare in December 1995 at the onset of the rainfall season. The observations made were compared with information from aerial photographs taken in 1993 and 1994 to identify sites where cultivation had expanded. On the basis of these observations, nine sites were purposively selected for the survey. Seven sites were in, or around, the high-density low-income suburbs of Dzivaresekwa, Hatcliffe, Sunningdale, Mufakose, Tafara, Mabvuku, and Warren Park. Two sites were within the low-density middle income suburbs of Mabelreign and Ashdown Park.3.1.2 Sample SelectionThere was no population list of individuals, or households, involved in urban cultivation from which to select a sample for the survey. It was decided to interview persons found working in the cultivated plots between 06.00 and 11.00 hours on the day the survey site was visited. This time period is when most operators undertake their cultivation activities. One day was allocated to each survey site. In situations where a group, or family members, were working together, only one person, indicated as either the owner, or operator, or responsible child, or adult was interviewed. Eight research assistants conducted the interviews using a structured questionnaire. A total of 520 persons were interviewed over a 10-day period. Most of the interviewees regarded the study as an opportunity to air their views on urban cultivation. Five persons refused to be interviewed.Table 1 Profile of Respondents by Survey Sites and GenderFemale MaleSurvey Sites No. (%) No. (%)Dzivaresekwa 34 (74) 12 (26)Hatcliffe 29 (64) 16(36)Sunningdale 43(61) 28 (39)Mufakose 32 (49) 34 (52)Tafara 50 (62) 31 (38)Mabvuku 16 (52) 15(48)Warren Park 19 (63) 11 (37)Ashdown Park 33 (40) 50 (60)Mabelreign 10 (37) 17(63)Total 266 (55) 214 (45)3.2 ResultsDue to missing data, there were 480 usable questionnaires from the 520 respondents. As the number interviewed was not based on a representative sample of all cultivators in Harare, the results may not be generalised for Harare, let alone other urban areas in Zimbabwe. The results are, however, indicative. Table 1 lists the respondents by survey sites.4The results elaborate on the socio-economic characteristics of the individuals interviewed their motivation for, assessment and perception of the issues surrounding urban agriculture. The analysis is based on descriptive statistics.3.2.1 Socio-economic Profile o f Respondents3.2.1.1 Household SizeTable 2 Respondents’ Household SizeHousehold size RespondentsNumber %0 no family 46 9.61 - 3 75 15.64 - 6 207 43.17 - 9 125 26.01 0 -1 8 27 5.6Mean 5.225 100Mode 5.0The average household size was 5.2 persons. This was made up of family members and kin. Twenty-six (26) percent lived in households of 7-9 persons and about 6 percent in households of 10-18 persons (Table 2). A relatively small percentage, 2 percent, of households consisted of more than 13 members. These sizes, given that most households have one breadwinner or none at all, mean that the dependence ratio is very high. Household size appears to be a factor in undertaking urban agriculture. Households composed of 5-9 members tend to be in the majority. These are most likely to be those under pressure to supplement their food sources and incomes as a survival strategy.3.2.1.2 Respondents’ Marital StatusSixty-six percent of the respondents were married, 12.3 percent never married, 12,9 percent widowed, and 4.6 percent divorced (Table 3). The proportion of female-headed households was 25 percent of the female respondents.Table 3 Marital Status of RespondentsStatus Female Male AllRespondentsNo. (%) No. (%) No. (%)Married 166 62.4 149 69.6 315 65.6Never married 22 8.3 37 17.3 59 12.3Widowed 52 19.5 10 4.7 62 12.9Divorced 14 5.3 8 3.7 22 4.6Not Applicable1 12 4.5 10 4.7 22 4.6Total 266 100 214 100 480 100’ Not applicable refers to respondents, mostly children, who were under 18 years and at school.Table 4 gives a profile of the cultivators by gender and claim to “ownership” of, or access to cultivated plot. By ownership the respondents refer to the fact that they had staked a claim to use the plot on a permanent basis despite the fact that they do not own the land. Overall, the majority of the respondents were women except in the two low-density middle income suburbs of Ashdown Park and Mabelreign. The majority of these female respondents (89.8%) were working on their own plots (Table 4). Ten of the female respondents were operators only on plots claimed by others and seventeen were hired workers.5Table 4 Profile of Plot “Ownership” StatusOwnership” Status(Number and % of Respondents)Gender Owner Operator HiredOperatorNo. (%)Only No. (%) WorkerNo. (%)Female 239 (50) 10 (2.1) 17 (3.5)Male:Spouse’sOwn 125 (26)-Other 25 (5 ) 13 (2.7)51 (10.6)Total 389 (81) 23 (4.8) 68 (14.1)Of the 214 male respondents, 150 (70.1%) were spouses of owners of the plots and 51 (23.8%) were hired workers. These results confirm that women are the predominant owners of the plots and constitute the majority of the operators. Most of the female and male hired workers were employed by landowners in the low-density middle income suburbs. The males are thus involved through assisting their spouses and as hired workers.3.2.1.3 Respondents’ Employment and Occupation StatusTable 5 Respondents’ Employment and Occupation StatusFemale Male AllRespondentsEmployment Status No. % No. % No. %Never been employed 184 69.2 13 6.1 197 41.0Currently Employed 51 19.2 144 67.3 195 40.6Retrenched 16 6.0 37 17.3 53 11.0On pension 3 1.1 14 6.5 17 3.6Recently left school 4 1.5 4 1.9 8 1.7Still at school 8 3 2 0.9 10 2.1Total 266 100.0 214 100.0 480 100.0OccupationProfessional 19 37.3 31 21.5 50 25.6Skilled 11 21.6 52 36.1 63 32.3Unskilled 5 9.8 33 22.9 38 19.5Domestic worker 12 23.5 25 17.4 37 19.0Other (street vendor) 4 7.8 3 2.1 7 3.5Total 51 100 104 100 195 100As shown in Table 5, the majority (67.3%) of the male respondents compared to 19.2 percent of the female respondents was in employment. The majority of the female respondents had never6been in an employment outside the home. Those recently retrenched constituted 6% of the female respondents and 17.3 percent of the male respondents.Of the 51 female respondents currently employed, 58.9 were professional and skilled occupations. Professional occupations included nurses and teachers and other occupations requiring diploma training. Skilled workers included those trained in artisan skills such motor vehicle mechanics, secretaries. Of the 104 employed male respondents, 57 percent were in professional and skilled grades. Those in professional and skilled occupations made up 57.9 percent of the total respondents. Those employed mostly in unskilled and low-wage employment (such as domestic workers) were in the minority (38.5%) of the total population.4.

On average they had 1.65 maize plots (Table 7) located in sites within their residential suburb. The average area planted to maize was 0.300 hectares. About 30.8 percent and 46 percent of the respondents expected to harvest 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 bags (50kg bags) of maize, respectively. Table 8 gives the expected group mean output. The weighted average was 5.08 fifty-kg bags of maize. Those respondent households who harvested 10 and above bags had high output either because they had large plots or owned several plots.7Table 8 Expected Maize OutputRespondents%Expected number of 50 kg bagsGroup Mean Output 50kg bagPeriod consumed at 0.435kg per person per day30.8 1 - 3 2.20 50.6 1.746.0 4 - 6 4.60 105.7 3.512.5 7 - 9 7.99 183.7 6.16.5 1 0 - 1 2 10.44 240.0 8.04.2 Above 12 14.45 332.2 11.1100.0 Weighted average 5.08 116.7 3.94.2 Time, Labour and input UseCultivators were in their plots from early in the morning (05.00 to 10.00 hours) and late afternoon (15.00 to 18.00 hours). The time worked per day ranges from one to four hours, with an average of three hours per day working in the plots (Table 9). Land preparation, planting, weeding and where applied fertilizer application, were cumulatively completed in three days. Harvesting lasted 2 to 5 days. Given that the average plot sizes and family size, it expected that all operations would be completed within short periods.Table 9 Input Use and labour timeRespondents Quantity/Number Used Mean Applying____________________________ CostInput No. % Mean Mode Std.Dev.z$Seed (kg) 480 100 10.80 10 1 10.00Basal fertiliser (kg) 262 54.6 34.24 50 42.05 15.81Top dressing fertiliser 9kg) 134 27.9 45.12 50 45.41 16.36Hired male labour 71 14.8 1.456 1 1.181 25.00Hired female labour Labour use:21 4.4 1.80 1 0.98 25.00Hours worked per day - - 3 2.5 1.5Total pre-harvest labour days - - 3 4 2Total harvesting labour days - - 2.85 3 0.89Average number persons - - 3.45 3 2.66workingSources: Survey, 1996As indicated in Table 9, 54.6 percent of the respondents applied basal fertilizer while 28 percent applied top-dressing fertilizer. The fertilizer and seed were purchased from local general dealer shops and vendors who sold these in smaller packets. A number were using seeds from previous harvest, given by friends or relatives. On average cultivators spent $15.00 on a basal fertilizer and $16.00 on tof>-dressing fertilizer. Ninety-two (29.2%) of the cultivators hired labour to carryout various operations, mainly land preparation and weeding. Hired labour charged $25 per 6-hour day.4.3 Saving on Food ExpenditureAt a weighted mean output of 5.08 bags, each respondent family would have 254 kgs of maize grain available for own consumption. Taking the mode family size of 5.0 and assuming that the average daily intake of maize meal of 435 gram per day per person (Jayne and Rubey, 1992) 254 kg would last for about 117 days (Tables 8 and 10). This represents about 3.9 months of maize grain supply and constitutes 32 percent of annual maize meal requirements. These results are consistent with findings of other researchers (Sanyal, 1986; Mbiba, 1992; Jayne and Rubey, 1992). In Lusaka, Zambia, Sanyal (1986) estimated that about 33% of food consumed8by poor households came from urban cultivation. Households harvesting 8 bags are able to meet 50 percent of their annual maize grain requirements.Table 10 Net savings from maize productionExpected Output LevelsTotal output: (50kg bag) 1 2.2 4.6 5.08 7.99 10.44 14.45Days expected to last @ 0.435kg 22 0 50.6 105.7 116.7 183.7 240.0 332.2Months expected to last 0.8 1.7 3.5 3.9 5.9 8.0 11.1% of annual grain requirement 6.30 13.86 28 97 31.99 50.32 65.75 91.01Value of grain @Z125/bag 125 275 575 635 998.75 1305 1806.25Milling costs 9.72 21.39 44.72 49.39 77 68 101.50 140.49Value of milled purchased grain 115.28 253.61 530.28 585.61 921.07 1203.50 1665.76CostsSeedFertiliser20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00Compound D 0.00 0.00 100.84 153.27 201 67 252.09 252.09Ammonium Nitrate 0.00 0.00 143.26 143.26 286.51 358.14 358.14Total Fertiliser CostsLabour0.00 0.00 244.09 296.53 488.19 610.23 610.23Pre-harvest 129.38 129.38 161.72 161.72 161.72 202.15 202.15Harvesting & post-harvest 12.50 27.50 57.50 63.50 99.88 130.50 180.63Total labour costs 141.88 156.88 219.22 225.22 261.59 332.65 382.77Total production costs incl. labour 161.88 176.88 483 31 541.75 769.78 962.88 1013.01Total production costs less labour 20.00 20.00 264.09 316.53 508.19 630.23 630.23Net value with labour -46.60 76.74 46.97 43.86 151.29 240.62 652.76Net value without labour 95.28 233.61 266.18 269.08 412.88 573.27 1035.53Sources: Calculated from Tables 8 and 9.Table 10 gives the output value, costs and net savings for the various expected output levels. The expected output is valued at the 1998 maize grain price of $35 per 18kg (or 20-litre bucket) in the local open grain markets in high-density suburbs. Production costs included seed, fertilizer (both basal and top-dressing). The average milling cost is $3.50 per 18-kg bucket used at local hammer mills. Transport cost was excluded as most people take their maize grain to hammer mills in their neighbourhood on bicycles, in wheelbarrows or on their heads. Labour is valued at the prevailing wage rate of Z$4.66 per 6-hour day for hired hands.The net amount saved is obtained by subtracting the production and milling costs of the maize grain into maize meal as shown in Table 10. If imputed labour costs are included, net saving per household ranged from Z$76.74 to Z$652.76 for the range of expected output levels. When imputed labour costs are not taken into account, the net saving ranged from Z$233.61 to Z$1035.53. Even for families harvesting one bag, they save $95.28 if labour is not taken into account. Thus a household gains by producing own maize meal. At the weighted average of 5.08 bags, the amount saved is equivalent to $67,27 per month. In 1993, Mudimu and Chigume (1994) found that the saving on food expenditure reached up to $100 per month. $67.27 buys 10.35 bread loaves at $6.50 per loaf.Other crops grown, such as pumpkin leaves, beans and sweet potatoes, also contribute to reducing household food expenditure and generated some cash from sales received. Relish crops mainly vegetables like pumpkin leaves and beans save on daily food expenses particularly during the rainy season. Sweet potatoes are eaten as bread substitutes in the months immediately after harvest, May to July.94.3 Cash Income for Sale of Excess GrainThose households who harvested 10 and more bags expected to sell 50 percent of the output due to either lack of storage or to forestall loss to weevils. The grain was sold to neighbours and on the open market. If 5 bags were sold at the average open market price of $35.00 per 20 litter (18kg) bucket, the cultivators stood to gain about $260.00 net of production costs (labour excluded). Thus the few who sold excess maize received cash incomes that augmented household incomes.5. ESAP and Increase in Urban cultivationThe year respondents started urban cultivation could be use to determine the link between ESAP and urban cultivation.5.1 Period Respondents Started CultivationTable 11 gives the different period’s respondents started urban cultivation.Table 11 period respondent started urban cultivationPeriod started Respondents%1956-1979 15.51980-1990 28.41991-1995 56.1Total 100%Source: Survey (1996)A break down of the respondent sample by the periods they started urban cultivation shows that 56% started cultivating between 1991 and 1995 (Table 11). This finding agrees with those of Mbiba (1995) and Drakakis-Smith (1995). This cannot be attributed to the increase in rural- urban migration whereby new city immigrants open up plots as 58.7 percent of the respondents were house owners while only 22% were lodgers and the rest were children or other relatives of house owners. This means that families that used not to cultivate were prompted to cultivate in the past five years. The fact that most (56%) started after 1991 (when ESAP was introduced) could reflect that economic hardships associated with ESAP have prompted more people to join urban cultivation.5.2 Linkage to RetrenchmentsTable 12 Retrenchment and period started cultivationEmployment Status of household Year started cultivationheadPrior 1991 After 1991Number No. % No. %Currently employed 195 75 38.5 120 61.5Retrenched 53 17 34.7 32 65.3Pensioner 17 24 75.0 8 25.0Never employed in the past 5 years 197 120 60.9 77 39.1Source: Survey (1996)A substantial number of workers, in both private and public sectors, were retrenched as a result of ESAP. Retrenchments result in loss of wage income. Family affected could have10resorted to urban agriculture in an attempt to either source a means of livelihood or to diversify sources of income. As shown in Table 12, of the 53 retrenched respondents, 65.3 percent began urban cultivation in the period 1991 to 1995 compared to 34.7 percent who started in the pre-ESAP period. A cross tabulation of the employment status of household head by the period the family started urban cultivation (before or after introduction of ESAP in 1991) suggests a linkage between retrenchments and urban cultivation.A Chi-square test of the dependence/independence between the employment status and period cultivators entered open space cultivation, was done. The Null Hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two classifications was rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship between the two at 5 percent level of significance. This further supports the notion that the time people started cultivating is related to the employment status of the household head.Table 12 reveals a link between formal employment and urban cultivation. The majority (61%) of those respondents who had never been in formal employment in the past five years started cultivation in the pre-1991 period. This shows that urban cultivation is an activity through which unemployed residents of the city sustain themselves.6. Attitude to and Awareness of Issues Regarding Urban AgricultureThis section reports on the findings of the case study regarding the respondents’ attitude to and awareness of the issues raised by urban planners and managers regarding urban agriculture.6.1 Access to Land and Views on Urban Agriculture Table 13 How Plots Were AccessedMethod of Access to Plot RespondentsNumber %First to claim plot 199 41.5Allocated by City Council 51 10.6Through farming group 32 6.7Allocated by land owner (church, school, factory) 21 4.4Given by friend or relative 111 23.1Renting 1 0.2Bought 1 0.2Not known (i.e. respondent child or hired worker) 64 13.3Total 480 100Table 13 shows that access to a plot for cultivation has essentially been by staking a claim to a piece of open land. Some of the respondents accessed land through farming groups that was allowed to operate, or were allocated land by the City Council in 1992. Plots were also obtained through donations from relatives or friends. A very small percentage (0.4%) of the respondents rented or bought plots. Such cases appear to be under reported. The sale and leasing of plots indicates that there is a market for the urban spaces for crop cultivation. This underscores the value attached to land for cultivation.The majority of the respondents (73 percent) were of the view that it was permissible to cultivate (Table 14). Fifty-five percent admitted that they cultivated without any form of permission, 30.2 percent and 15.0 percent had some form of permission from the City Council and rightful owners of the land, respectively. Those with City Council permission were members of co­operatives allocated land around 1992.11Table 14 Respondents’ Perception of Legality of CultivationRespondents’ Perception %RespondentsAllowed to Cultivate:No 19.0Yes 72.5Do not know 8.5100Who granted permission:None 54.8City Council 30.2Rightful Owner 15.0100Table 15 Respondents’ Views on Why Cultivation should be allowedWhy Cultivation should be Respondentsallowed %For food production 56.0Income generation 5.8Land is idle 15.2To clear the land 4.8For employment 7.3No land in rural areas 1.5Recreational activity 9A100Fifty-six percent of the respondents were of the view that cultivation on available land should be allowed to enable food production (Table 15), because the land was idle (15.2 percent) and for recreational activities (9.4 percent). Cultivation was considered as providing opportunity for income generation and employment. Some respondents (1.5%) would want urban cultivation to be allowed, as they do not have access to land in rural areas.6.2 Views on Alternative Land UseTable 16 Respondents’ View on Alternative Uses of the LandAlternative Ranking Land Use1 2 3 4 IndifferentNo % No. % No. % No. % No. %Housing 320 66.7 69 14.4 9 1.9 1 0.2 81 16.9Factories 81 16.9 223 46.5 21 4.4 19 4.0 136 28.3Recreational 12 2.5 28 5.8 85 17.7 160 33.3 195 40.6The ranking of alternative use of the lands under cultivation (Table 16) suggests that respondents gave more weighting to building residential accommodation followed by12factories. This is a reflection of the two problems facing the urban population, namely shortage of accommodation and high rate of unemployment. The use of the some of the lands for recreational facilities such as parks, playing fields, etc. received very low ranking. This suggests that the respondents did not consider this as appropriate use of the urban spaces, given the need for urban agriculture.6.3 Environmental Impact AwarenessTable 17 Awareness of Illegality of Stream Bank CultivationAwareness %Not aware 18.1Aware 81.9Specific Knowledge:Accurate 9.2Wrong 9.8Vague idea 16.0Ignorant 20.0No response 45.0100.0The main concern about urban agriculture, by the City Council planners and managers, is the environmental impact and the resultant cost for urban environment management. The major issue has been on cultivation in wet lands in catchment areas and along stream banks protected by the Natural Resources Act of 1975. Cultivation of these areas contributes to silting of river systems and city water reservoirs. The respondents were asked about their knowledge and assessment of the issues. Table 17 shows that there is a high degree of awareness of the prohibition of stream bank cultivation. However, 65 percent of respondents were either ignorant, or could not specify, that cultivation was not allowed within 30 metres of the river/stream bank. Only 9 percent had accurate knowledge, or information.

Conclusion and Policy implicationsUrban agriculture is used mainly for subsistent maize production. It improves food grain availability, thus increasing household food security and real incomes available for other household requirements. Thus urban cultivation saves on food expenditure and augments household incomes. This is the incentive for cultivation on undeveloped urban land spaces.This study has presented evidence showing that the rapid expansion in urban cultivation in the period 1991 to 1995 could be attributed to the effects of economic reforms initiated in 1991. As a result of ESAP, the urban population faced economic hardships due to increase in prices of basic food commodities (bread, maize meal, and milk), education fees, transport costs and retrenchments. As reported by Drakakis et at. (1995) immediately following devaluation and removal of subsidies in 1991, the price of maize meal, bread and milk rose by 14%, 32% and 13% respectively. The urban populations turned to urban cultivation for food security; savings on food expenditure and cash income generation from sell of surplus produce. Urban agriculture thus alleviates some of the economic hardships that worsened with the advent of ESAP.Current urban planning byelaws and concepts regard urban agriculture as an inappropriate urban land use. Thus, the City Council discourages the practice. The cultivators acknowledge that their activities are not supported by urban authorities nor sanctioned by owners of the land, mainly the City Council. However, they regard the activity as necessary and the risks as worthwhile to sustain the livelihood of the families in face of economic difficulties.The fact that some land is lying idle was given by respondents as a justification for their utilization of such land. Regarding alternative use of the lands under cultivation, the respondents gave more weighting to building residential accommodation followed by factories. This is a reflection of the two problems facing the urban population, namely shortage of accommodation and high rate of unemployment. Given the need for urban agriculture, the respondents did not consider as appropriate the use of the urban spaces for recreational facilities.The majority of the cultivators were aware of but ignored the stream bank regulations. There was general lack of knowledge about the environmental impacts of cultivation on the urban environment. There are no formal programmes in place to provide information on landuse practices. Most of the cultivators use information based on agricultural knowledge and practices gained from past activities in rural areas.Two factors will determine the future of urban space for agriculture. One is the increase in urban population that is likely to lead to increase in proportion of the population in the low-income bracket. The second is the continued economic hardship due to retrenchments, unemployment, and continued increase in cost of living. These factors will continue to make urban agriculture an important source for food. Due to these factors, local authorities should support cultivation on certain open lands. A clear policy on urban agriculture, as a significant land use, needs to be formulated. The Department of Agricultural Extension and Technical Services (AGRITEX) and the Community Services Department of the City of Harare should design a programme to provide information and extension on husbandry practices that minimises environmental degradation should be developed. Schools could be used as channels of information and education on environmental impacts of urban agriculture as well as proper land use management practices. The cultivated plots and silted waterways could be used as practical demonstrations for school programmes. The University Faculty of Agriculture could develop an outreach extension programme through farm field-schools whereby students and staff could provide training and advice on proper husbandry to the urban agricultural producers. The programme could be used for student field attachments or internship.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe funding for research on which this paper is based came from the ZIMWESI Research Project, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zimbabwe.15REFERENCESBowyer-Bower, T.A.S. and G.

Projections show that by 2020, 85% of the poor in Latin America and 45% in \nAfrica will be concentrated in urban areas [1]. Cameroon is not an exception to this fast urban growth as 52% of \nher population lives in towns and cities [2]. According to the National Institute of Statistics [3], 12.3% of the \npoor in Cameroon are concentrated in urban settings. The Bamenda city has great difficulties to cope with this \nrapid urbanization as it faces major challenges in creating sufficient employment opportunities for the poor and \nthe rapidly growing population which is estimated at 322889 inhabitants. Out of which, the urban population \nconstitutes 269530 while the suburban population is estimated at 53359 inhabitants [2]. \nThe practice of agriculture in the city of Bamenda provides an alternative solution and complementary \nstrategy to cope with the problems of rapid population growth. Urban agriculture reduces urban unemployment, \npoverty and food insecurity. Urban agriculture also plays an essential role in enhancing urban food security. This \nis because the costs of supplying and distributing food to metropolitan areas are based on rural production and \nimports continue to escalate and do not satisfy the demand, especially of the poorer sectors of the population [3]. \nThe contribution of urban agriculture to food security and healthy nutrition is undoubtedly its most important \nasset [4]. Food production in Bamenda is in many cases is a response of the urban poor to insufficient, unreliable \nand irregular access to food, health, income, well-being and the low purchasing power in the city. Urban \nagriculture also improves access to a cheap source of protein and the quality of the food in the households is \nimproved as poor families involved in farming eat more fresh vegetables produced by themselves in gardens [5].  \nThis urban agricultural practice is accompanied by negative consequences on the landscape. Soil \ndegradation in Bamenda is rampant due to the poor techniques of production which places the population at risk. \nRisk zones (steep slopes, wetlands, inland valleys, and escarpment) have been occupied for agriculture and \nsettlement by urban farmers. This activity is thus preoccupying and needs to be redressed. \nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows; section 2 demarcates the study area, section 3 and 4 \naddresses the factors shaping urban agriculture and tackles the dynamics of the Bamenda Urban landscape \nrespectively. Section 5 tallies on the impacts and mitigation measures, section 6 looks at the way forward, \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n56 \nwhereas section 7 draws a logical conclusion. \n \n2 Location of Study Area \nBamenda city is located between latitude 5°56’0’’ and 5.933°N and longitude 10° 10’ 0’’and 10.167°E (Figure \n1) [6]. The town is situated in the western highlands of Cameroon at an altitude of 1230m-1510m. Bamenda city \nregroups three sub divisions namely; Bamenda I (Bamendankwe), Bamenda II (Mankon) and Bamenda III \n(Nkwen). It has a surface area of 22.9 Km² [7]. \n \n3 Factors Accelerating Urban Agriculture in the Bamenda City Council \nThe practice of urban agriculture in Bamenda is fostered by diverse factors. These factors can be grouped under \nthe economic, social and political context. The economic factors include devaluation of the FCFA, civil service \nreforms and crisis in the cocoa and coffee sector. The political factors include multi-partism and the social factor \nis link to rapid population growth. These factors are diagnosed in the subsequent sections \n \n3.1 The Social Context \nThe social context in Bamenda is characterized by rapid Urbanization typical of towns in developing countries. \nThe rate of urbanization in Bamenda like in other towns of the south is alarming [8]. According to Mougeot [9], \nurbanization in developing countries is occurring at an unprecedented rate. This rapid increase results from rural \nexodus and natural increase of the population. This rapid population growth in Bamenda is causing problems of \nunemployment, poverty, food insecurity and hunger leading to adoption of urban agriculture with its \nconsequences on landscape. \n3.1.1 Population Growth \nCameroon is not an exception to rapid population growth and its problems witnessed by many developing \nnations. Its urban population was 18% in 1967, 22% in 1976, and 40.1% in 1991 and presently it is estimated at \n51.5% [2]. As one of the major urban centers in Cameroon, Bamenda has experience spectacular increase in its \npopulation. The national census on population and housing of 1976-1987 in Cameroon revealed that Bamenda \nwas ranked 4th with a 7.8% average annual growth rate among towns of more than 10000 inhabitants and 5th \nbetween 1987-2005 with an average annual growth rate of 4.9% among towns of more than 50000 inhabitants. \nBamenda urban space has a population of 269530 people and a surface area of 22.5km² giving a population \ndensity of 718p/km². This high population pressure is attributed to a number of factors among which is high \nfertility. Early marriage is common among teenage (17-18years) who start child bearing at the age of 19years \n[10]. Family planning, education and the use of contraceptive is low. The culture, custom and tradition of \nnursing children for wealth and reduction in infant mortality due to improve medical facilities explain this \nincrease in population growth. Table 1 shows trends of population growth in Bamenda since 1976. It is noticed \nthat the population of the town has more than double from 1976 to 2005. This rapid increase in population is in \ndisequilibrium with available resources. Population growth stresses the carrying capacity of the land, increase \nfood shortage and hunger necessitating urban agriculture and improved farming to supply the needs of the \npopulation (Figure 2). In Bamenda, population pressure has led to the occupation of marginal lands such as the \nsteep slopes of the Sisia quarter in Nkwen, swampy areas along the banks of River Mezam and its affluence, \ninland valleys of Mankon for agricultural purposes. \n \nTable 1: Evolution of Population of Bamenda Urban Space by Sub Division between 1976- 2005 \nArea 1976 1987 2005 \nBamenda I 3368 7710 18468 \nBamenda II 28385 64984 159210 \nBamenda III 16358 37448 91852 \nTotal 48111 110142 269530 \n              Source: Regional service of statistics N.W.R [11] \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n57 \n \nFigure 1: Location of Bamenda Urban Lay Out \nSource: INC, Données GPS 2012 \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n58 \n \n \nFigure 2: The nexus between rapid population increase and urban agriculture. \n \n3.2 The Political Context \nCameroon witnessed the democratic wind of change that blew across African nations in the early 1990’s. Under \ninternal and external pressure, the government introduced multi-partism and democracy in Cameroon in \nDecember 1990. In the advent of multi-partism, laws favouring freedom of association paved the way for \npolitical liberty, freedom of expression and association. \nIn 1990, the Social Democratic Front (SDF) was formed in Bamenda as a consequence of multi-\npartism. The birth of this party in May 26, 1990 opened way for political competition and transformation of \nBamenda as an opposition strong hold. This event transformed the political and socioeconomic life of the town \ntill present. Bamenda is also the mother of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC), a group that has \nbeen fighting for the cessation of Anglophones from the republic of Cameroon on grounds of francophone \ndomination. \nAccording to the district chairman of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) Bamenda II, Mr Che Napoleon, the \nappointment of a government delegate to the Bamenda city council and other parts of Cameroon were measures \nto counteract the influence of the opposition party. He further notes that the government delegate of Bamenda \nhinders actions of SDF mayors geared towards helping the urban population. Bamenda according to him has the \nsmallest number of roads, poorly designed, very narrow and hardly exceeding 6m large, characterized by pot \nholes, very dusty in the dry season and muddy in the rainy season. The investment budget allocated for Bamenda \neach year is hardly exhausted despite the multitude of problems the town faces. This, therefore, shapes the \nBamenda agricultural sector in many ways. \n \n3.3 The Economic Context \nCameroon enjoyed economic stability from 1960-1985. Between 1970 and 1985, its economy grew at 8% per \nannum. The exportation of cash crops was the principal response to this fast economic growth [11]. In 1977, cash \ncrops made up 72 percent (71.9 percent) of exports while oil was 1.4 percent. This situation changed in the \n1980s as a result of oil exploration. In 1985 oil made up 65.4 percent and cash crops 21.4 percent of exports, \nwith government getting high royalties from international oil companies developing the field [12]. This period \nwas characterized by heavy wages paid to public and para-public sector employees. However, this era of \neconomic boom was short lived as trade and oil revenue started to decline. External borrowing and reserves held \nabroad permitted the government to push back any reforms until 1987 and President Paul Biya announced some \nbudget cuts [13]. However, this measure failed to remedy the situation as deficits continued to rise, and by 1989, \nthe government had no option but to enter into a structural adjustment agreement [14].  \nThe economic environment that resulted to hardship in Bamenda City Council (BCC) was characterize \nby devaluation of the CFA francs, crisis in the cocoa and coffee sector, the retrenchment of civil servants from \ncivil services and salary slides [15]. The BCC being an integral part of Cameroon could only succumb to these \nreforms as any other locality in Cameroon. This eventually obliged urban dwellers to uptake agriculture as an \nadaptive and coping strategy in the BCC. \n3.3.1 Devaluation \nSome authors hold the point that devaluation is a fiscal policy that increases the export potentials of a country \nwhose currency is devalued. Instead of devaluation acting as a problem solving policy, it worsened the \nlivelihood of people in Cameroon in general and Bamenda in particular. The CFA was devalued by 50%, \nRapid Urban \ngrowth \n \nIncreasing \nunemployment  \nHigh concentration of \npeople in the town High pressure \non resources \nHigh dependence on \nUrban Agriculture \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n59 \nwhich consequently meant that the prices of imported goods doubled immediately after devaluation. The \ndevaluation of the currency in January 1994 virtually paralyzed all segments of Cameroons’ economy and \npopulation. Implicitly, the strategies adopted by producers, businessmen and consumers were unfortunately \nneutralized by the negative effects of devaluation [16]. Moreover, inflationary price increases, loss of \ncompetitiveness of traditional export crops on the world market, excessive taxation, government’s withdrawal of \nsubsidies from the agricultural sector, inefficiency in the production system were the results. \nIt is realized from Figure 3 that, the prices of farm input increase after the franc CFA was devalued. \nThere is a great difference between prices of input in 1993 and those in 1995. This had a lot of repercussions on \nthe population in that the increase in prices of goods were not counteracted by a substantial increase in the \npurchasing power of the people in Bamenda. This policy aggravated the already existing low purchasing power \nof the people. Several urban residents opted for urban agriculture as a means to palliate the increasing food bills \n[17]. \n3.3.2 The Civil Service Reforms of 1990’s \nWith the adverse conditions of the economic crisis, the World Bank imposed the compression of public agents to \nthe Cameroon government. It was necessary for purposes of efficiency and better management of the public \naffairs, the production and distribution of public goods, utilities and services, the definition and application of \neconomic policy and the management of public expenditure at optimum levels. The civil service reforms \ntherefore had an extended objective which was the creation of a public service whose dimension, qualifications, \nmotivations, behavior and the sense of responsibility would allow it to assure a better service corresponding to \nthe expected role of the State. According to Nunberg [18], the inability of the Cameroonian government to \nmanage and finance their civil services stem from the fact that the civil services itself was too large, too \nexpensive and insufficiently productive.  \nIt appeared rather glaringly clear that for a long time, state employment in Cameroon received a large \npay packet (Table 2). The civil service was too expensive because public sector wage bills constituted too high a \npercentage of total government revenues and accounted for too high a percentage of GDP [18]. Most civil \nservants that were retrenched had to venture in urban agriculture to continue living in towns. \nTable 2: Situation of Civil Service and Wage Package in Cameroon 1990-1995 \nYear No. of civil servants Annual wage packet( CFA ) \n1990 188200 300,000,000,000 \n1995 155210 190,000,000,000 \nSource: Commis d’état OS NOV-DEC 1999 \n3.3.3 Crisis in the Cocoa and Coffee Sector \nIn an attempt to curb or reduce the effects of the economic crisis in Cameroon, the government agreed on the \nproposition of the Bretton Woods Institution to liberalize the cocoa and coffee sector. With the hope that in \nprivatizing the activities of the agricultural sector, economic stability will be attained, the époque of an \nomnipresent State happened to be a nostalgic affair. In this optic, State enterprises in charge of regulating the \nagricultural sector were either closed down; their budget reduced enabling the functioning of only the managerial \nstaff or liquidated [15]. One of them was ONCPB1 which was in charge of stabilization of prices of agricultural \nproduce, distribution of fertilizers and allocation of credits to farmers. The liberalization of the agricultural sector \nled to its closure. Prior to1986, this structure employed more than 10000 people [18]. By 1992 it had less than \n1800 employees due to a reduction of its activities during liberalization. Other structures that faced similar \nsetbacks were SODECAO2 and FONADER3. \nThe liberalization of the coffee sector which was the principal income producer of the North West \nRegion in which Bamenda is found had drastic consequences on the farmers. For a long time, they had been \nacquainted to the intervention of the state in price stabilization and input subvention. The policy of liberalization \nworsened the precarious state of many coffee producers and middle men that depended on this activity for a \nliving. Many farmers could not support the drastic fall in coffee prices in the world market because agricultural \ninputs were on a constant increase making cost of production high [19].  \nMost rural dwellers around Bamenda had to look up to this urban area as their last recourse. Many in-\nmigrants, shortly after arriving in town will notice that it is not a bed of roses as people of the countryside think. \nFaced with such circumstances most of them were obliged to indulge in agriculture to keep life moving. \n \n3.4 Cultural Heritage \nCultural heritage is another factor that explains the cultivation of crop in the BCC. Many informants testified \nduring field investigation that they were born in agricultural setting and cannot live without farming. Most of \n                                                          \n1\n Office national de commercialisation des produits de base \n2\n Société de Développement du Cacao \n3\n The National Fund for Rural Development  \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n60 \nsuch informants were found in sub-urban areas of the BCC and those that had migrated from the countryside. \n4 Dynamics of Agriculture in Bamenda Urban Space \nAs postulated by Sinclairs’ theory on agricultural land use, the density of agricultural activities increase as we \nmove from the city center to the sub-urban areas. The case of Bamenda urban space is not different for areas \naround the city centre are occupied by small gardens. Away from the central business district, the farm sizes \nbecome larger. \n \n4.1 Urban Agricultural Land Use \nCrop production in Bamenda is done in four geographic spaces namely wetlands, densely settled zones, sloppy \nareas and sub urban locations. The techniques of cultivation utilized in each of these areas are specific. There are \nfactors that determine the techniques of each of these geographic spaces which are both human and physical. \nThere are human factors such as the high concentration of buildings, council laws regulating urban agricultural \nactivities, culture and tradition of the people. Physical factors include the nature of the terrain, humidity of the \nsoil and land availability. \n4.1.1 Wetland Exploitation \nMarket gardening in Bamenda is practice in wetlands. In Bamenda, these areas include corridors of rivers such \nas those of River Nki Nelia and streams such as Nki Nshewu, Machu, Nkyi Ashega. Marshy lands below the \nFoncha Street, those behind the G.R.A in Up-station and others are equally wetlands. It should be noted that \nmost inland valleys in Bamenda are wet valleys which in most cases are wetlands. These wetlands have gone a \nlong way to foster market gardening and increase the income of gardeners. The wetlands in Bamenda are \npeculiar in that they are humid throughout the year. The precipitation receive within the town is about 2500mm \nin the high lava plateau (Bamenda I) and 2300mm in the intermediate plateau which incorporates Bamenda II \nand III (Region delegation of transport) [6]. This high precipitation rates ensures the continuous humidity of \nthese area throughout the year. \nThe humidity of these areas favours the cultivation of market gardening throughout the year except for \nwetlands which are usually flooded at the peak of the rainy season. This constant cultivation has improved on the \nliving conditions of market gardeners in Bamenda. The crops produce in wetlands in are mostly vegetables such \nas huckleberry, cabbage and green spices which are highly demanded and consume on daily basis by most \nfamilies. \nWater availability is also an important factor that favours the location of poultry farms, piggery and \nanimal tethering. Water spaces are used by livestock breeders as areas for the discharge of animal waste and \ncleaning of animals. These lands are prohibited from construction of habitats and other form of real estate \nbusinesses following the risk involve. It is for this reason that crop cultivation and livestock breeding is carried \nout here. \nSome farmers practice irrigation and these are mostly urban farmers growing vegetables during the dry \nseason. These farmers undertake this activity in wet inland valleys, swampy areas and low lying areas such as \npart of Foncha Street, corridors of River Mezam and its tributaries. Farmers used watering cans or water cannons \nto pump water into their gardens. Others, practice furrow irrigation whereby they divert water from streams into \ntheir gardens during the months of November, December and January. \n \nFigure 3：Farming Techniques used during the Dry Season \nA: Intensive Farming in Wetlands at Nkwen.

Note \nstream (D1). \n4.1.2 Densely Settled Areas and Gardening \nRapid population growth in Bamenda has led to a dense concentration of habitat. The dense concentration of \nhabitat decreases as one move from Commercial Avenue (the central business district) to peripheral quarters. \nThe quarters that surround the central business district (Ntarinkon, Musang, Ntamulung, Nitop and Azire) are \nthose with the highest concentration of gardens. Vegetables, plantains and bananas are planted on cleared spaces \nin the compounds. With increasing population, the demand for agricultural products has increase and \nconsequently these products have known considerable hikes in prices. Against this back drop, urban dwellers \nhave been showing interest in cultivating crops and rearing animals around compounds in order to reduce the \ncost of living. The cultivation of crops around compounds can be seen near houses in GRA (Up-station). \nMix cropping is the strategy used by farmers who cultivate crops around compounds. Faced with land \nscarcity in the highly densely populated quarters, mix cropping is economical, efficient in soil nutrients \nexploitation. Land use is also maximized as a ridge carries a high plant population. There is effective use of \navailable plant nutrients as the different crops obtain nutrients at different soils depth. It also reduces crop failure \nwhich may result from pest and diseases attack leading to food insecurity. \nGardening around homes in Bamenda helps families to produce some food for subsistence with reduce \ndependence on markets. This is a coping strategy that has reduced the effects of the economic crisis since the \n1980’s in most urban households in Bamenda. \n4.1.3 Cultivation on Sloppy Areas \nHardship brought to Bamenda by the adverse effects of the economic crisis coupled with rapid population \ngrowth has accelerated space consumption. Inadequate vertical construction also explains this rapid space \nconsumption. Inadequate land for agricultural activities has caused urban dwellers to solicit sloppy areas which \nare areas forbidden by law for the construction of houses. Farmers have taken advantage of this law to perch \nagricultural activities on hill side, rocky slopes and the Bamenda escarpment (see Figure 5). \nThe Bamenda escarpment covers a large surface area in the three sub division. The difficulty in \nconstructing houses on the escarpment due to its steeply and rocky nature at certain spots pushes crop cultivators \nto such areas. Despite the risks involve in practicing agriculture in such areas, some dwellers are compel because \nthey utilize urban agriculture as a livelihood strategy. \n4.1.4 Cultivation in Sub-urban Areas \nAccording to Sinclair’s theory on land value, land values are low as we move from the city center to the \nperiphery. Moving from Commercial Avenue in Bamenda towards Santa, Mankon Fondom, Naaka, Banja, Bafut \nand Bambui, land becomes available and less expensive. The advantages offered by these peripheral zones give \nroom for agricultural techniques necessitating large surfaces to be practice. In the sub urban areas of Bamenda \nthe “slash and burn” techniques is widely used. \nIn the “slash and burn” technique, some farmers use fire as a clearing tool preferably in the dry season \nwhen most of the vegetation is dried up. Trees of small and medium sizes and grasses are cut down, allowed to \ndry and subsequently fire is set on it. Fire is perceived as labour serving in the cutting and clearing of the \nundergrowth. According to Boerner [20] the amount of phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and calcium \nreleased by burning are high in relation to both totals and quantities of these elements available in the soil. This \nadded advantage of soil fertility is however short lived as the output for the first years are usually high then the \noutput reduces as years go by. \nThe “slash and burn” technique is locality known as “Ankara”. With this technique grass is cut down \nand pile in heaps and few weeks before the rainy season starts, ridges are formed on the heaps and shortly, fire is \nset on the grasses beneath the ridges (Figure 4). This grass is burnt by the fire resulting to production of a \npowder ash which fertilizes the soil. Figure 6 depicts the urban land use of Bamenda \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n62 \n \nFigure 4: The “Ankara” technique in Up-station \nA: shows grass that has been cleared, piled and arrange in ridges (A1).

The occupation of wet lands for agricultural purposes \nleads to pollution and reduction of water bodies. Intensive cultivation of slopes especially on the Bamenda \nescarpment has greatly reduced the vegetation cover and accelerated erosion. The massive cutting down of trees \nin areas where land is abundant such as in the sub-urban areas has increase biodiversity degradation and soil \npollution through the use of chemical fertilizers. The perching of livestock activities behind houses, near water \ncourses and around areas where waste is dump in densely populated areas has occasioned water and land \npollution. In this section each of these impacts on the landscape will be examined in detailed. \n \n5.1 Landscape Degradation \nRapid population growth in Bamenda is a recurrent issue of the day. This problem can be appreciated when it is \nconsidered that the world witnesses an additional one billion people to its population every eleven years [21]. \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n63 \nThe population of Bamenda is obliged to grapple with the frightening population pressure which has experienced \nan astronomical and galloping growth rate. This astronomical increase signals a greater disaster for an already \ncrisis ridden area whose landscape has been exploited and plundered for a long time. The life support systems of \nour planet are beginning to buckle under the pressure of ever increasing human members consuming ever \nincreasing amount of resources. \nPresently, monumental landscape changes in Bamenda are the order of the day. The landscape trilogy; \nman, landscape and resources gives a synopsis of a complex inter-relationship between them [21]. Man’s \nevolutionary dominance in Bamenda through the elaboration of his needs has forced the hands of nature and has \nintroduced significant landscape changes. In this respect, the population of Bamenda by their extensive and \nirrational alterations in farming has become a threat to their own survival. Agricultural activities are rapidly \ntransforming the landscape into other land uses, thereby inflicting irreversible mutations to their ecological \ncharacter that might completely destabilize the system. The natural feedback of the creation of new farmlands in \nmarginal areas of Bamenda which should have been left under natural vegetation cover is accelerated erosion \nwhose rate depends on the methods of ploughing, time of planting, nature of crop on farm. \n5. 1.1 Decline in Biodiversity \n5.1.1.1 Destruction of Vegetation \nAgriculture is one of the pioneer factors responsible for vegetation change in Bamenda. Poor agricultural \ntechniques accelerate vegetal destruction. Vegetation destruction has been augmented to an unbelievable level \ndue to the ever increasing demographic push making the population of Bamenda to increase their desire to \nmaintain a measure of control on the supply of food [6]. At the initial stage, the damage was transient as there \nwas always enough time for cleared vegetation to recuperate. However, as population increase, it became \ndifficult to allow enough time for the land to regenerate its original plant cover and degradation gradually sets in \n[22]. The high demand for foodstuff in Bamenda obliges the farmers to intensify land use. Slopes, wetlands and \nsub-urban areas have been stripped of their vegetation cover for agricultural activities. \nAgricultural techniques in Bamenda involve the use of rudimentary farming tools such as hoes, digging \nmattock, sickle, pig axe and knives. The use of these farm tools for agriculture has led to accelerated vegetal \ndestruction especially in pockets of forest reserves in Nkwen, Mankon, Mendakwe. The major species fell \ninclude Albizzia gummifera for fabrication of hoe handles. Some other species are used on farm for fencing and \nfor the construction of pig fences. Such species include Ficus oreodryandum, Dracaena deisteliana, datura \ncandida (antolong in Mankon). Some trees are used for staking of crops such as tomatoes and beans. Examples \nhere include Raphia (Reclinata and Vinicifera) and Arundinaria alpia. However bamboos from the raphia bush \nserving as gallery forest are not only use for staking, their barks are stripped and woven into farm baskets, used \nby almost every house hold for transportation and storing of crops. Younger Bamboos serve as tying ropes. In \ncombination with Allopylhlus ballatus, Lasiosiophon glaucus, Seda rhombifolia and Arundinaria alpine also \nserve as alternatives where they are found. Other utensils serving as complements to agricultural products are \nprovided by carvers. These include wooden bowls, baskets mortar and pistles which are derived from both the \ntrees and their branches. Such species include Tabernae Montana pachysiphon (nibemibi in Mankon), Polyscias \nfulva and Croton macrostachyus (tsah in Mankon). The above situation is exacerbated by the ceaseless quest for \nfarmers in Bamenda to increase output. This quest obliges farmers to colonize additional farmlands in the area \nwith obvious devastating effects on the landscape. The increase use of trees in the building of poultry houses, pig \nhouses increases vegetation destruction. It should be noted that most pig houses are built using bamboos and \nplanks obtain from certain forest trees, eucalyptus and cypress as seen in Figure 6. \n \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n64 \n \nFigure 6: Use of bamboo and trees for various practices in agriculture in Bamenda \nA; shows Bamboos used to build a poultry house in Nkwen. Note (A1) bamboos.  \nB; plank made out of eucalyptus is used in constructing a pig fence in Shisia quarter.  \nC; exposes the use of forest trees in making handles of hoes(c1) and bamboos for drying of corn in Mulang. \nD; a young lady is carrying a basket weaved with raphia bamboos for transportation in Mankon. \nShrinking vegetation cover therefore lessens the lands capacity to intercept, retain and transpire precipitation. \nInstead of trapping rain percolated to ground water systems, deforested areas become a source of surface water \nrun-off. Quick transport of surface water translates into flash flooding and more localized flooding will occur.  \nThe vegetation community has considerable influence on the micro-climate. They control the rates of \nevapotranspiration, wind speed, and ambient temperature. Because plants, especially woody plants require a lot \nof Carbon-dioxide for their metabolic activities, the plant communities are important carbondioxide sink [23]. \nThey thus play significant role in the dynamics of the phenomenon of global warming which is presently gaining \nworldwide attention. The vegetal destruction of Bamenda has contributed to the dynamics of it micro climate as \ntemperature are becoming more and more high. \nAnother effect of vegetation destruction is its impact on soil water conservation. The opening up of the \nland usually results in total runoff of water which comes from precipitation. In the natural ecological system, the \nplant also serves to prolong the time the rain water would reach the soil, so that when it eventually reaches, it \nsinks down the soil profile and or produces only light overland flows. Thus rain water which would otherwise \ndrain off from the area is retained locally through the effects of the standing biomass. The significance of \nbiomass in this respect has been well demonstrated by researchers in tropical towns [24]. Due to this vegetation \ndestruction, most sloppy areas in Bamenda are witnessing erosion during rainy periods. Again, when rain falls on \nbare land, a large volume of sediments is produced and eventually emptied into water bodies within Bamenda. \nThe deposition of silt in water bodies causes them to silt-up and eventually make them useless for water storage. \nMost of the water causes in the town of Bamenda are becoming shallower. This shrinking can be explained by \nerosive activities aggravated by vegetation destruction.     \nNaturally, inland valleys, watershed and marshy areas have their vegetation that is capable of \nconserving and preserving water for a long time as long as they are not put in a state of disequilibrium. The \nnatural vegetation that is embedded in these natural spaces in Bamenda has partially or completely been removed \nin certain areas due to over cultivation [25]. Agricultural activities such as tilling, dredging and leveling of land \ndistort the normal drainage of this water reserves and hitherto expose their soils to dry conditions. This therefore, \nresults to water shortages especially during dry periods. The exploitation of wet lands in Bamenda has increase \nwith the rapid demographic push of the area. This population pressure imposes constant cultivation without any \nfallow periods so as to meet up with the high demand for agricultural produce express by the population of \nBamenda. Most crops are now cultivated 2-3 times a year which has made wetlands to be highly demanded \nespecially during the dry season when cultivation is almost impossible on dry lands. Water shortages resulting \nfrom the irrational exploitation of wet lands has called for the use of watering techniques which also generate \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n65 \nother problems. The use of water pumps in watering entails the deviation of water channel into the farms. Some \nareas in Bamenda getting water downstream are at times deprived of water at the peak of the dry season because \nsuch water courses have been deviated into gardens up stream. \nThe implication of vegetation destruction is also considerable with respect to wild life. Plants cover also \nprovides habitats and food for wildlife. Degradation of plant communities therefore means destruction of \nwildlife. Many animals in Bamenda are now confined to a few inaccessible locations or are extinct due to \ndeforestation .The main sanctuaries for many of this wildlife are forest reserves such as that in Mendankwe. \nField work revealed that earth worms no more exist in some farms. This can be attributed to the intensive use of \nfertilizers and pesticides which greatly affects the pH value of the soil rendering it acidic or alkaline which is not \nconducive for the stay of these little animals.  \nEncroachment of farmers into forest reserves of Bamenda is a call for concern (Table 3). This is \nbecause land available for agriculture in Bamenda is decreasing prior to the rate at which its population \nincreases. Efforts are deployed by the government through the ministry of environment and nature protection and \nthe ministry of fauna and flora to stop the population from degrading these forests reserves. However, farmers \ndevelop strategies every day to farm in the forests. The encroachment of farmers into the Mendankwe forest \nreserve has resulted to the reduction of the forested area. This encroachment of urban farmers has increase \nfarmland and reduces wetlands in the Mendankwe forest area. \nTable 3: The rate of Farmers’ Encroachment on to Forest Reserve in Bamenda \nForest reserve Locality \nNumber and \ndate of \nclassification \nTotal \narea (ha) \nRate of \nencroachment \nEncroachment of \nfarmers to a lesser \nextent and grazers to \na greater extend \nBafut-Ngemba \nBetween Santa \nand \nMendankwe \nER public notice \nno 10 of 1953 3238 45% \nFarmers encroach \nless than grazers \nLocal Council Reserve for Fuel \nMankon fuel \nplantation \nMankon \nNtamulung \nSCLN No 35 of \n1961 62 - Towards extinction \nMendankwe fuel \nplantation Mendankwe \nER order of \n1954 127 - \nMassive felling \nalmost nonexistent \nwith the remission of \nland to the chief \nSource: ONADEF, cited by Nkwemoh 1999 \nMoreover, forested land represented 70% in 1978 but by 2006 this percentage has fallen to 33% representing a \n37% decrease in terms of surface area (Table 4). This reduction went to the benefit of farmland which rose from \n22% to 50% [26]. The increase in grassland is explained by the savanization process which involves the gradual \nconversion of forest to grass. Wetlands have equally been losing their potentials. \nTable 4: Evolution of Forest and Land Cover from 1978-2006 in the Mendankwe Forest Reserve \n(Bamenda I) \nLand cover class Area 1978 \n(ha) \n% area \n1978 \nArea 2006 \n(ha) \n% area \n2006 \n% Change \n1978-2006 \n% annual \nchange \nForest 2946 70 1373 33 37 1.3 \nFarmland 936 22 2106 50 28 1 \nGrass/shrub 163 4 613 14 10 0.3 \nWater/Wetlands 173 4 126 3 1 0.03 \nTotal 4218 100 4218 100   \nSource: Land Cover Change by Vincent, 2009 \n \n5.2 Urban Pollution \nPollution is one of the major problems that agricultural activities have brought in the Bamenda urban milieu. \nBoth crop cultivation and animal breeding are sources of pollution in Bamenda. Water courses in Bamenda are \ncontaminated by refuse resulting from pig farming. Some of the pig fences are located near water courses. Such \npig breeders dump unwanted waste in water courses. Grass that results from clearing of land in the urban milieu \nis at times dump into the water courses. Farmers who dump cleared grass in water courses are those that utilize \nhigh quantity of chemical fertilizer, since vegetation takes some time to decay. The dumping of agricultural \nwaste in these waters contaminates and narrows their channels. The water courses easily overflow their banks \nduring rainy periods. The contamination of streams in Bamenda has negative consequences. Some urban \ndwellers utilize water gotten from these streams in household chaws. Such contaminated water leads to disease \ninfections. Farmers working in and around polluted surfaces water supply risk their health. The pollution of these \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n66 \nwater bodies also come from waste dump by hotels, restaurants, educational institutions, garages and motor \nrepairs. This therefore becomes very dangerous for Bamenda urban farmers who mostly exploit the borders of \nwater bodies for crop cultivation. A study carried out in Yaoundé shows that effluents from breweries contain \n2080mg/I chemical oxygen demand, 259mg/l metal sulphide, 1650mg/l biochemical oxygen demand, 41.5mg/l \nphosphate and 71.5mg/I Ammonium along with colony forming units (CFU) fecal coliforms and 50 CFU 100ml \nfecal streptococci [27]. When such dangerous substances are found in water, it puts the farmers’ health at risk \nand the crops cultivated might not be adequate for consumption. \nVicinities in Bamenda where pigs and fowls are reared are disgusting. Waste resulting from pig fences \nand poultries pollute the air of the environment. The construction of pig fences and poultry farms has drawn the \nattention of the BCC. The council is discouraging the practice of animal breeding in the city center because of \nthe odour they produce which inconveniences the city dwellers. The BCC also discourages this activity because \nit dirties the town. Most of the pig fences and poultries observed are built with provisory materials. These \nprovisory materials include barks of trees, raffia bamboos, sticks which dirty rather than beautify the town. \nContaminated air in some quarters of Bamenda is said to be the origin of respiratory diseases. \n \nFigure 7: Pollution of Urban Environment by Waste from Food Market \nA: Gabbage from crops (A1) thrown into a stream (A11). B shows cabbage leaves dump into water (B1) and \nused basket thrown into water (B11). \n5.1.3 Soil Degradation \nSoils in Bamenda have lost their natural potentials due to the annual routine of cultivation which does not offer \nany opportunity for fertility regaining [28]. The constant exposure of wetlands through vegetal destruction for \nfarming has made them to lose their quality as water reserve. The soils in this area rarely have natural \ncharacteristic. According to the Chief of Agriculture for Mezam Mss. Christina, it is because some of the soils \nhave been exhausted and others are close to exhaustion. This low fertility of the soils has led to application of \nchemical fertilizers and manure. Chemical fertilizers have a short term reaction. Despite their temporal reactions \nfarmers have a preference for their utilization in Bamenda. The implications of chemical fertilizers stems from \nthe fact that it changes the pH of the soil by either rendering it more acidic or alkaline depending on the type of \nfertilizer used which becomes poisonous to soil organism.  \n4.1.3.1 Soil Erosion \nVegetation degradation has led to erosion in Bamenda. One of the functions of vegetation is the maintenance and \nstabilization of soils in the ecosystem. When biomass is removed, protection is withdrawn and the soils become \nvulnerable to erosion. In and around the farmlands of Bamenda, erosion is a consequence of agricultural land use \nmethods which do not encourage adequate soil cover [29]. \nMost crops cultivated in the study area have a short vegetative cycle from planting through weeding to \nharvest. The cultivation of such crops has a higher propensity to accelerate vegetal degradation and consequently \nsoil erosion. This is especially the case as the duration of crops on the farm does not exceed 3-6 months. The \nconstant tilling and weeding of the farms makes the soils to be loose such that most of the soil particles liberated \nare rapidly transported downstream. This situation is worsen as most of these crops are cultivated 2-3 times a \nyear meaning the soil for a greater part of the year is usually free of consistent vegetation to bind its particles \ntogether. The heavy rains experienced in Bamenda during the rainy season leads to the loss of the top soils \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n67 \nthrough erosion. \nAnother reason for erosion in the farming area of Bamenda is the technique of cultivation. The topography of \nBamenda is very undulating. Most farms are perched in sloppy areas. Some farmers in Bamenda do not practice \ncontour ploughing which is the best way to minimize effects of erosion on steep slopes. The farmers lay furrows \ndownward instead of against the slope. The establishment of furrows across the slope permits rain water to \nreplenish below. Rain drops are blocked by ridges and given enough time and possibility to infiltrate. Cultivating \nalong the slope as is the case in some areas of the Bamenda escarpment does not only wash away crops but also \ncreate conditions for the loss of valuable top soils. As soil conditions continue to impoverish, the resultant effect \nhas be outward movement of the population (Figure 8). \n \nFigure 8: The Vicious Cycle of Land Degradation \n \n6 Actors, Initiatives and the Way Forward \nMan has developed a unique capacity to intervene in nature. But by setting himself apart he has tended to ignore \nhis responsibility to understand the consequences of such interventions, not only for himself but for all other \norganisms with which he shares the planet. Faced with this environmental degradation, a number of actors are \ninvolved in environmental protection in Bamenda. These actors NGO’s, common initiative groups (CIG’s) the \nCameroon government through ministerial departments. A series of strategies deployed by the different actors to \nreduce landscape deterioration are examined in the section that follows.  \n \n6.1 Role of NGO’s and Common Initiative Groups in Reducing Landscape Degradation \nAn agency that is involved in fostering sustainable environmental exploitation is SIRDEP. This NGO was \nofficially recognize in Cameroon by 1993.This institution is composed of a multi-disciplinary team of \nagronomist, forest extension workers, agro-economist and environmentalist who work hand in gloves to reduce \nthe effects of landscape degradation. Their activities have played an important role in re-greening Bamenda. This \nre-greening is geared towards reducing erosion that is mostly observed on hilly and sloppy areas of Bamenda. \nTable 5 indicates SIRDEP efforts in fighting against landscape degradation through re-greening. This institution \nhas other objectives other than environmental protection which makes its implication in this domain a bit limited. \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n68 \nTable 5: Number of Seedlings Planted in Mendankwe by SIRDEP \nType of trees Mendankwe (Bamenda I ) \nPygeum Africanus 1176 \nMaesopsis 876 \nMahogany 2765 \nCalliandra 9000 \nAcassia - \nSource: SIRDEP 1997 cited in Nkwemoh 1999 \nThe next institution that is also concern with environmental protection is HELVETAS was established \nin Cameroon in 1961 [30]. The focal point of this institution is the protection of catchment areas. It is worth \nwhile noting that the missions of this organization are becoming increasingly difficult with the recent population \npressure that is pushing farmers in Bamenda to colonize marginal lands especially during the dry season when \nwet areas become a rare resource. Nevertheless HELVETAS has contributed a lot in preserving many wet lands \nin Mendankwe and Mankon. \nFurthermore, Sustainable Agriculture and Self-help (SASH) is an N.G.O that was created in 1989 \nwhose main objective is to adjust development. The organization pleads for sustainable exploitation of resources. \nSASH also encourages permanent farms, curb deforestation and soil erosion as well as improve on the life style \nof farmers. There is also the sustainable livestock foundation (SLF) founded in 1991. Its objective includes the \nassistance of farmers to improve on their life style through the implementation of regenerative and sustainable \nagricultural techniques that are environmentally compatible. The NGO also promotes agro-forestry amongst \nfarmers in Bamenda.  \nSustainable Agro-forestry Promoters (SAP) was created in 1994 also exist. The main objective of this \nNGO is to fight against environmental degradation through the implementation of permanent farming system \nand agro-forestry. Its agro-forestry program has been very successful. Respondents in Mankon revealed that \nwhen this organization started sensitizing and mobilizing them, they were very reluctant to adopt agro-forestry. \nHowever as time went on, many farmers discovered that it was the best technique for soils protection. \n \n6.2 The Role of Government Agencies in Environmental Protection \nApart from NGO’s and CIG’s, the government is also fighting against unsustainable agricultural practices. The \nregional and divisional delegation of environment and nature protection and L'Agence nationale d'appui au \ndéveloppement forestier (ANAFOR) are government institutions involve in reducing the consequences of \nlandscape degradation in Bamenda. \n6.2.1 The Regional Delegation of Environment and Nature Protection and Sustainable Development \n(ENP) \nThe delegation is fighting without relenting efforts to maintain the existing forest reserves especially the Bafut-\nNgemba forest reserve (Mendankwe) which has witness massive degradation from urban farmers, carvers, \ncharcoal marketers in Bamenda. It is in this optic that the forest guards leave no stone unturned to see that \ndefaulters are brought to law. Beside the protection of forest reserves, the Cameroon government through the \ndelegation financed and afforestation  program of 16000 trees for the year 2010-2011 and 8000 for the year 2012 \nto reduce and fight the effects of erosion and climate variability caused by the joint effects of farming and \nurbanization. Some of such trees can be seen on the Bamenda escarpment and behind the Ayaba hotel. \nThe Cameroon government through the delegation of environment and nature protection sign a \nconvention that ran for three years with the three councils of Bamenda (Bamenda I, II, and III). A sum of 5 \nmillion FCFA was given each year beginning 2008-2010 to reinforce the ongoing afforestation program. The \ndelegation has also been heavily involved in the distribution of bio-fertilizing seeds such as those of Calliandra \nwhich is rich in nitrogen and suitable to be used in agro-forestry. The ENP have also develop a nursery to permit \nthem easily carry out their mission of re-greening. With their nurseries, it becomes more reliable to distribute \nyoung plants to farmers in Bamenda than giving money or seedlings which might be mismanaged as has been \nthe case in the past. \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n69 \n \nFigure 9: Bio-fertilizing Plant Species in the Nursery of the Regional Delegation of ENP in Up-station \nA shows leucenna and B represents Calliandra which is the most important bio-fertilizing species in Bamenda \ndue to it high nitrogen content. \n6.3.1 National Forestry Development Agency (ANAFOR) \nThis agency works in collaboration with other actors notably NGO’s. Their main aim is to redress the bareness \nof the soils of Bamenda that has resulted from massive tree felling for diverse uses. They also work in \ncollaboration with the local councils. ANAFOR has financed the planting of trees covering 2 hectares in \nBamenda I and II councils and three hectares in Bamenda III from 2010-2012. Species mostly involve \neucalyptus, pygeum, mahogany, cypress, myesobsis and gmellina. Below is a list of NGO’s and hectares of trees \nthey have planted in Bamenda under the financial ship of ANAFOR. \nTable 6: Trees Planted by some NGO’s in Bamenda under the Financing of ANAFOR \nOrganisation Area (hectares) Tree species \nSHUMAS 5 Proneus \nLiving land 5 Proneus/Eucalyptus \nMENTH 2 Eucalyptus \nNkwen multi-purpose 2 Eucalyptus \nSource: ANAFOR 2012 \n \n6.4 Simple Agronomic Measures against Soil Degradation \nMethods of farming that should take place in Bamenda should consider the triggering force of tilling and plant \nnutrient requirement [30] because of the high value of ferric oxide, aluminum oxide and pH values of potentially \nrisky eroded areas in Bamenda. In this light, the measures propose here are adaptive farming technique (contour \nploughing) and terracing of the slopping surfaces of Bamenda. These methods are of low cost and have a multi-\ndimensional role in soil erosion control [31]. \n6.4.1 Adaptive Farming System \nThe principal objective of making ridges by the farmers in Bamenda is to aerate the soil by making it loose and \nimprove water infiltration .Unfortunately for diverse reasons, farmers who farm on sloppy areas in Bamenda cut \nthe furrows down the slope than across the slope which goes a long way to create and increase channels that \nfacilitates movement of surface water and the load it carries. Although the different environmental actors are \ntrying very hard to discourage this technique, it still persists. According to a study carried out in the mezam area \nby Nkwemoh [31], the results showed that contour farming reduces soil erosion by 50-80% and increase crop \nyield by 6-66%. Doolette and Smyle [32] brought forth the thesis that contour ploughing is more effective in \nreducing erosion by 40-74% than grass contour hedges. The study in Bamenda therefore seeks to encourage the \npropagation of contour ploughing as it goes a long way to improve the pedogenetic crisis through a number of \nways. With the loose soil from the furrows, surface roughness is increased, runoff is reduced and hence soil \nerosion is controlled. \n6.4.2 Progressive Terracing \nConsidering the fact that runoff and soil erosion have a direct relationship on slope, the establishment of terraces \nwill go a long way to reduce soil erosion on sloping surfaces. Terracing advocated here presupposes the stepping \nof sloping surfaces of Bamenda to provide slots of level surfaces. The level slots would reduce runoff and \nconsequently the material that is eroded facilitates infiltration and permits a good reconstitution of soil nutrient \nthat would result in increased yields. \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n70 \nIn order to ensure the success of this method, the progressive ridge terracing in permanent cultivation system \nshould be adopted because other system realize with the use of stones to erect embankments like in the Tingo \narea are very costly, painstaking, and difficult to be widely adapted. \nThe bonds between the low and high terraces should be reinforced with hedgerow species such as \nCalliandra, Podocarpus, Polyscias through potted seedlings, Crassocephalum, Tephrosia and Crotolaria \npropagated through casting. On each developing stair-case that would be well developed, the farmer will then \ncultivate crops. The farmer should till the soil into the ridges and furrows depending on seasons. This would \nfacilitate infiltration and permit gradual percolation of water to the water table. The main bonds would capture \nsediments while acting as speed break to run off. The base of each segment is raised and this will stabilize the \nsoil. \n6.4.3 Vegetative Methods to Curb Soil Erosion \nVegetative methods entail the inclusion of trees, shrubs and herbs in the agricultural systems of Bamenda. The \ntree species propose by the agricultural and environmental delegations are Calliandra, Trephosia, Leuceunna \nand Sesbania. They are considered as bio-fertilizing species because the litter resulting from them is rich in \nnitrogen. This nitrogen is an important element in plant growth. According to an informant, this technique \nderives it merit from the point of view that it is ecologically important, economically viable, socially just, and \nadapted in nature. This soil improvement technology used is known as agro-forestry. \nAgro-forestry is a practice of cultivating crops and integrating trees at the same time on the same plot. It \nwas only in 1970 that this practice gained scientific recognition (Kammogne 1995). For agro-forestry to be an \neffective method of curbing soil erosion and at the same time increasing the fertility of the soil, the area and its \ncharacteristic should be known and the tree species characteristic needs to be mastered. The farmer’s need, \npreferences, taste and farming habits should be taken into consideration. \nIncluding tree culture into farms would be of importance in many dimensions to the degraded land of \nBamenda. The integrated trees would help protect the soil surface and check the removal of the soil surface \nparticles in many ways. This includes the provision of leaves cover which takes the brunt of heavy rainfall \nthereby checking its capacity to loosen and remove soil particles. Vegetation also helps to prevent the soil \nsurface from becoming battered and clogged by heavy rain through it roots and stems that penetrate the soil. \nVegetation carries surface moisture into the ground and allows it to percolate gradually but deeply. More so the \nwide spreading and deeply penetrating nature of plant roots help to bind the soil particles together and hold the \nsoil in place. \nSoil fertility improvement trees are planted in farms to increase crop yields in Bamenda. They include \nTephrosia, Calliandra and Scrotin. Tephrosia enriches the soil with nitrogen needed by crops and leaves of \nScrotin trees are very rich in soil nutrients and enrich the soil when they fall off from the trees. The Scrotin trees \nin the farm can also be used as wind breaks thereby protecting crops.                                                                       \n \n6.5 Environmental Conservation Education, Campaign and Awareness Raising \n6.5.1 The Use of the Print Media \nThe techniques of using newspapers and tracts in educating farmers and the general public is an adequate one. \nThe landscape conservation bodies educate the people through newspapers such as the “Farmers voice” (which is \nbecoming more and more popular in the area), the chronicles, Cameroon tribune, the post, the herald which are \nhighly appreciated in the area. \nThe printing and distribution of pamphlets, charts, and which carry information on environmental \nconservation is also suggested. It is true that the” farmers voice” operate almost as propose above but their \nobjective is purely commercial, which makes it difficult for a poor farmer to sacrifice his little finances to \npurchase regularly the different journals they produce. It would have been preferable for different actors to \nsubsidize this newspaper which is capturing without relentless the attention of farmers in Bamenda. By so doing \npoor agricultural practices that are not compatible with the environment can gradually be reduced. \n6.5.2 Education of Farmers through the Radio and Television \nTFF & Foundation Radio (100 FM) is a radio station in Bamenda. With its slogan “Giving Voice to the \nVoiceless” through their famous program Foundation for Environment and Development. The programs motto \nis “Accessible and Affordable Justice for Man and Nature”. The program has changed the agricultural practices \nof some farmers in Bamenda. The added impetus of the program is the use of Pidgin English in the diffusion of \ninformation which is understood by more than 70% of the dwellers of Bamenda. \nAs concerns television stations, the local” Afrique novel” has environmental educative programs which \nare complemented by those of the CRTV. But many dwellers in Bamenda are hardly interested in such programs \nas they prefer films and series. \n6.5.3 Capacity Building \nIn an attempt to render landscape mitigation practices more serious and sustainable, diffusion of such knowledge \nshould start from primary schools. In the same line, it should be acknowledge that the ministry of basic \nJournal of Poverty, Investment and Development                                                                                                                             www.iiste.org \nISSN 2422-846X     An International Peer-reviewed Journal \nVol.15, 2015 \n \n71 \neducation has included environmental studies in their program for some years now but the only problem lies in \nthe fact that it is not taught with the same zeal like other subjects or again there are certain schools especially the \nprivate schools who have not yet integrated such subjects in their programs. If this strategy introduce by the \nministry is well managed, the next generation of farmers will be very conscious of landscape degradation. \nSeminars, workshops and fora should be multiplied in Bamenda as this will raise awareness and permit \na careful assessment or evaluation of the state of environmental crisis and possible action plan to be pursued. In \nsuch seminars, emphasis should be laid on the collaboration between government, NGO’s, and farmers as their \ninterplay would sort lasting solutions. Preference should equally be given to women since it is realized that they \nform a majority of the farming population. According to Adhikari et al [33] women typically make a wider use \nof products than men and thus have a greater interest in sustaining the diversity of forest. \nAn example of the above recommendation is the regional consultation and planning seminar on \nenvironment for the North West which took place in Bamenda from April 25-30th 1994. This seminar was jointly \norganize by the UNDP, GTZ and the then MINEF. The seminar was attended by representative of local farmers, \ndelegation of ministries concern, university lecturers as well as free participants within and outside the country. \nAt the end of the seminar, some strategies were proposed. Such seminars should be multiplied even at the quarter \nlevel to permit the message to touch every farmer. \n \n7 Conclusion \nThis study has addressed the population quest for food security within the urban landscape of Bamenda and how \nthe interplay influences each other. Furthermore, the role of stakeholders and types of agricultural practices \nwithin the Bamenda urban landscape has been examined. As can be seen from previous section, agriculture in \nBamenda provides an alternative solution and complementary strategy to cope with the problems of rapid \npopulation growth, reduces urban unemployment, poverty and food insecurity. Food production in Bamenda is in \nmany cases is a response of the urban poor to insufficient, unreliable and irregular access to food, health, \nincome, wellbeing and the low purchasing power in the city. Urban agriculture also improves access to a cheap \nsource of protein and the quality of the food in the households is improved as poor families involved in farming, \neat more fresh vegetables produced by themselves in gardens. Although there are positive sites of urban \nagriculture to reckon with, It could be deduced that if urgent measures are not employed to arrest the continuous \nsurge of Bamenda city population, landscape deterioration will continue to an unprecedented rate and will \nfurther constrain agricultural output.  \nBoth past international and domestic measures to ensure sustainable food production and to curtail \nadverse anthropogenic impacts on the urban landscape, have proven counter-productive. Therefore, a re-\nawakening of positive mindsets, especially on the sides of Cameroonians as concerns best agricultural practices \nand state-of-the-art landscape management is needed. Taking in consideration the current economic setbacks, it \nis recommended that the acquisition of novel approaches in addressing poor urban agriculture strategies and its \nnefarious impacts on the landscape should be carefully studied and adapted such that it could be reachable to \nmany.  \n \nReferences \n[1] Tinker, I.

The chapter \ndevelops a contextual understanding of urban agriculture in South Africa and \nelsewhere in the developing world. The chapter makes a case for the research and \noutlines why the topic is necessary for investigation. The chapter closes by \ndiscussing the methodological considerations which identifies the appropriate \nmethods for studying the topic.  \n1.1 Background \nUrbanisation and urban growth have increased rapidly in developing countries. It is \nwidely recognised that although natural growth in the population plays a large role, \nrural to urban migration is also a significant contributor to urbanisation (Masika, \n1997). In South Africa and in much of sub-Saharan Africa rapid economic growth is \nrelated to urbanisation. Often cities in the developing world experience economic \ngrowth combined with extreme rates of urban poverty and unemployment within their \nurban centres (Molelu, 2014). In most cases the cause of urban poverty and \nunemployment in cities is closely linked to population growth and the subsequent \nbacklog in basic services and infrastructure. This is the case for Johannesburg, \nwhere “Aggregate measures of Johannesburg’s demographic and economic growth \nprosperity mask complex underlying socio-economic inequalities and cultural \ntension” (Rudolph et al. 2012: 1).  \nA definition of urban poverty can encompass both an economic and a social \nperspective. Most commonly, urban poverty has been associated with lack of income \nor consumption. However, recent definitions of urban poverty tend to include “non-\nmaterial deprivation and social differentiation” (Masika et al. 1997: 2).   \nIn the past, poverty and a lack of basic services had generally characterised rural \nareas, but more recently the ’urbanisation of poverty’ is apparent, where the trend of \npoverty is moving from rural to urban areas. Statistics South Africa (2014) indicated \nthat in 2011 the percentage of people living in poverty in rural areas amounted to \napproximately 68,8%, while in urban areas it was significantly lower with a \npercentage of 30,9%.  \n2 \n \nDue to urban conditions many more urban residents are considered to be poor. \nLekganayne-Maleka (2013: 2) asserts that “the incidence of poverty in urban areas \nmay be underestimated by poverty lines that take no account of the higher costs of \nmany necessities. Many urban households face serious deprivations, despite having \nincomes above the US$1 a day poverty line.” Urban poverty is strongly linked to the \npurchasing power (Lekganayne-Maleka, 2013) of a household. Richards and Taylor \n(2012: 8) remind us that “in the urban context, households are forced to purchase \nmost of their food for consumption, but their ability to obtain nutritious and healthy \nfood is determined by their access to income and employment”. For rural residents it \nis easier to generate food for themselves because they have access to agricultural \nland. In urban areas, land is mostly used for property development or for commercial \nactivities that contribute to a city’s economic growth. Urban areas are mainly \ncharacterised by built-up developments, such as apartment buildings and offices, \nand one will rarely see agricultural activities taking place in these areas. \nIn Johannesburg, for example, urban areas incorporate mostly office, apartment or \neducational buildings. Although there are open spaces such as parks, this is a rare \noccurrence. This leaves hardly any opportunities for people to start their own \nagricultural production in urban areas and is often as a result of the fact that many \ncity officials believe that agricultural land in urban areas should be used for future \ncity construction and that agricultural activities should be left to rural areas (De \nZeeuw et al. 2011).       \nPoverty alleviation has been on the policy agenda for years now. Both national and \nprovincial governments have functions that are related to poverty alleviation, which \ninclude housing, education and healthcare services (Republic of South Africa, 1996). \nIn response to this ongoing challenge, the National Development Plan (NDP) (2011) \naimed to eradicate poverty and inequality by 2030 (NPC, 2011). However, the rapid \nincrease in urban population still creates challenges for both city managers and \nresidents. According to the Johannesburg Poverty and Livelihoods Study of 2008, \nthe city’s poor are vulnerable and find it very difficult to access services and \nopportunities to better their lives (Rudolph et al. 2012).  \nThe rise of poverty in urban areas has led people to adopt various livelihood \nstrategies. Richards and Taylor (2012) mention the various livelihoods strategies that \n3 \n \nboth rural and urban households use to deal with poverty, some of which are \ndiversification of economic activities; saving on expenses by only spending on \nessentials; or selling assets. In the face of rising food prices, unemployment and \npoverty, many people in urban areas of cities in South Africa have resorted to a \nnumber of informal activities.  These include street trading, setting up of stokvels \n(informal savings accounts), or even running a business out of their households \n(hairdressing or spaza shops). How the urban poor have developed various \nlivelihoods strategies in Johannesburg is important to the research and will be further \nelaborated in the chapters that follow.  \nUrban agriculture is a growing phenomenon and much recent research has been \ndedicated to the topic. Although not a new concept, it has become a major defence \nagainst food insecurity and also has the potential for people to generate income. Its \nability to feed people in poverty and its capacity to do this in a sustainable way has \nmade it an interesting subject for research, future policy development and urban \nplanning approaches in South Africa. While many authors have seen the potential of \nurban agriculture in contributing to poverty alleviation, food insecurity and \nvulnerability issues, others have emphasised caution when considering urban \nagriculture as a poverty alleviation strategy.  \n1.2 Research Questions \nThis section outlines the research questions which covers the overall concern that \nthe study aims to address and is followed by a set of sub-questions which explore \nthe underlying points for focus within the investigation. The research question and \nsub-questions are as follows:   \nResearch Question: To what extent does the Siyakhana urban food garden improve \nthe livelihoods of Johannesburg’s urban poor, and what are the implications of such \ninitiatives for urban planning? \n- What are the expectations and experiences of food gardens in reducing \nvulnerability of the urban poor?  \n- How does the Siyakhana Initiative respond to the challenges of the urban \npoor? \n4 \n \n- How has involvement in the Siyakhana Initiative impacted upon the livelihoods \nof its current members/employees? \n- What are the implications of the Siyakhana experience for planning that is \nresponsive to the urban poor? \nThe above research question narrows down the investigation to a more targeted \naspect of urban agriculture that the research aims to explore. Although there are \nmany aspects within the urban agricultural field, such as the raising of livestock, the \nstudy aims to focus only on those aspects related to urban food gardening. The \nSiyakhana Initiative has been chosen as the case study for the investigation as it \nrepresents a suitable example of urban food gardens in Johannesburg. The initiative \nhas been running for years, which is important and valuable to the research because \nof its sustainability and evident experience as an urban food garden.  \nThe research question aims to investigate various factors of vulnerability within \nhouseholds in Johannesburg and whether urban food gardens are able to alleviate \nthese vulnerability issues and facilitate resilience for the city’s poor population. In \nconsidering this, the research question aims to investigate what this means for the \nurban planning profession and the role that municipal planning and policy can play in \nfacilitating urban food gardens and what recommendations can be made.  \nSub-question one relates to the literature to be explored on urban agriculture as it \nasks what already has been experienced with regards to urban food gardens for the \npoor. It also investigates urban food gardens’ experiences in reducing vulnerability in \nother countries by researching the various benefits and challenges that have been \nfaced. It also focuses on understanding the concepts of vulnerability, sustainability \nand livelihoods.  \nSub-question two aims to assess the institutional structures and support for urban \nfood gardens. Therefore it relates to what mechanisms Siyakhana has put in place or \naims to put in place that make it possible for the poor to participate in and benefit \nfrom urban food gardens. The sub-question also explores the nature of support \nurban food gardens require from other stakeholders (local government, Non-\ngovernmental organisations (NGOs) and private donor organisations) which will \nensure the food gardens’ ongoing institutional sustainability.    \n5 \n \nSub-question three aims to investigate the experiences of members of the initiative \nand explores whether their livelihoods have been substantially improved or whether \nthey have faced any new challenges since joining the initiative. This question also \naims to understand why they have joined the initiative, and includes those factors \nsuch as difficulty finding employment and household food insecurity levels. The sub-\nquestion explores whether participation in urban agriculture is a useful livelihood \nstrategy for them in terms of mitigating the worst effects of poverty and improving \ntheir lives.  \nSub-question four attempts to extrapolate from the findings some implications for the \nbroader realm of urban planning in facilitating initiatives that assist in improving the \nresilience of the urban poor. Addressing this question will involve an investigation \ninto whether planning is or should aid in creating environments which would allow \nurban food gardens and initiatives like Siyakhana to thrive. The question also aims to \ndevelop a set of recommendations for urban planning and local government on how \nthey can incorporate urban agriculture into urban policy and development. \nDepending on findings and analysis of the Siyakhana food garden the sub-question \nalso aims to develop suggestions relating to what is needed in order to sustain \ninitiatives such as Siyakhana, so that the urban poor are able to truly benefit from \nurban food gardens.  \n1.3 Aims and Objectives/Purpose of the Research \nThe overall intention of this research is to investigate urban agriculture as a \nresponse to addressing urban poverty in Johannesburg. It does this by exploring the \nextent to which it has served as a mechanism to create sustainable livelihoods for \nfarmers working at the Siyakhana Initiative. The research therefore explores how \nurban agriculture may be able to create social, economic and environmental \nimprovements for the urban poor and considers the need for urban planning to \ncontribute to the success of urban agriculture as a livelihood strategy.  \n- Therefore the study looked at key literature that formed the basis for framing \nthe empirical research and assessing the findings.  \n- Through the detailed enquiry, the research drew on the experiences of \nparticipants in a well-established urban food garden (i.e. Siyakhana) \n6 \n \n- By looking at principles that describe what a sustainable livelihood would \nentail, the study aimed to assess them against the results from the \ninvestigation.  \n- It obtained tentative conclusions/recommendations about the significance of \nurban food gardens in reducing urban poverty and vulnerability/improving \nlivelihoods, and what this means for municipal planning and policy support. \n1.4 Rationale \nRecent research done on the topic of urban agriculture includes a dissertation done \nby Nicolle (2011) which looks at urban food gardens and empowerment. But what is \nclosely related to the current topic of the report is a paper by Dawson (2008) who \ninvestigates whether the Siyakhana garden can be a suitable model of urban \nagriculture. \nMost research done on urban food gardens and particularly research focusing on the \nSiyakhana Initiative has been concerned with food insecurity. The purpose of this \nresearch report is to contribute to existing research by proving that vulnerability \nissues go beyond food insecurity and include deprivation and income poverty.  \nWhat is different about this investigation is that it focuses on the extent to which the \nSiyakhana urban food garden contributes towards reducing vulnerability and \nstrengthening the livelihoods of poor urban households in Johannesburg. An \nimportant contribution that the research makes is that it not only considers \nSiyakhana as a livelihood strategy for the urban poor but also builds on recent \nstudies by exploring new solutions to the challenges of inner city poverty.  \nThe study also examines the role that urban planning plays (or should play) in the \ngrowth of the urban agricultural sector. Therefore, the study analyses how urban \nplanning can be used to further and facilitate the development of initiatives such as \nSiyakhana in the city of Johannesburg. \n \n \n \n7 \n \n1.5 Research methods \n1.5.1 Qualitative Method \nQualitative methods are aimed at investigating aspects of social life such as \nexperiences rather than obtaining information that can be sampled statistically \n(Patton and Cochran, 2002). The most commonly used methods in qualitative \nresearch are participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups. This \nresearch will mainly be focusing on participant observations and in-depth interviews \nas tools in the investigation. \nQualitative methods aim to ask the ‘what, how and why’ of the study (Patton and \nCochran, 2002) which will assist in investigating the perspectives of Siyakhana \nmembers, both those benefiting from the gardens and those in management, as well \nas their experiences and challenges. A qualitative research method offers the \nfreedom to conduct the interview in the form of a conversation, thus possibly gaining \nunanticipated information from the respondents that might make significant \ncontribution to the study. Given that the research is exploring vulnerability, a \nqualitative method proved to be a suitable method because it helps gain information \nin a flexible way.  \nEven though it is possible to obtain levels of vulnerability quantitatively, the current \nresearch was able to obtain information that assesses the experiences of those who \nare vulnerable. This included gaining information by asking ‘why?’, ‘what?’ and \n‘how?’ which obtains the opinions of members and their reasoning for doing certain \nthings. While quantitative data might be useful in gaining information on household \nfood consumption of the gardeners, the information derived from this can be quite \nrigid in the sense that although it might indicate that food consumption has improved \nsince working at the garden it does not help in understanding whether the gardeners \nhave gained a sense of empowerment since joining the food garden.  \nThe study utilised the DFID Livelihoods Framework to structure the questionnaires, \nand to assess the livelihoods of members by using data from the interviews. The \nlivelihoods framework is useful because it is able to analyse micro environments \nsuch as urban food gardens and can therefore show how households of different \n8 \n \ncategories are able to improve and become more resilient. The framework \ninvestigated the Siyakhana Initiative through the use of the following criteria:  \n1. The Vulnerability Context \n- In order to fully understand the livelihoods of the gardeners, the investigation \nneeded to obtain an understanding of the various factors that shape their \nlivelihoods. What was explored was the shocks, trends and seasonalities that \naffect the livelihoods of the gardeners. For example, it could be aspects as \nloss of employment or fluctuations in food prices. \n2. Livelihoods Assets \n- The study investigated the human, natural, financial, social and physical \ncapital to examine the strengths of the gardeners. The argument is that \npeople need all five capitals to achieve a decent livelihood. Therefore the \nstudy investigated what assets the gardeners have access to and what assets \nthe Siyakhana initiative supplies them with.  \n3. Livelihoods strategies \n- Important to the study are the ways in which the gardeners are able to \ntranslate their livelihood assets into livelihood outcomes. Therefore, the study \ninvestigated the various livelihoods strategies they have or are still employing \nin an effort to improve their livelihoods. These strategies may include residing \nin close to place of work or obtain social grants from the government. \n4. Institutional support \n- The livelihoods of people are influenced by more than the vulnerability context \nor the livelihoods assets and strategies. It is therefore important to the study \nthat the institutional context was explored because these are often the \nstructures put in place that can either give access to or deny certain assets.   \n1.5.2 Case study method \nAccording to Bromley (1990: 8), a case study is a “systematic inquiry into an event of \na set of related events which aims to describe and explain the phenomenon of \ninterest”. Using a case study for the research is important because it contributes by \ngiving an actual example of how a group of poor people carry out their livelihoods \nthrough making use of urban food gardens as a livelihood strategy. The case study \nis therefore important because it helps connect the phenomenon of urban agriculture \n9 \n \nwith a real-world case. A case study method plays a significant role in obtaining “an \nup-close or otherwise in-depth understanding of a single or small number of “cases” \nset in their real-world context. The closeness aims to produce an invaluable and \ndeep understanding - that is, an insightful appreciation of the “case(s)” – hopefully \nresulting in new learning about real-world behaviour and its meaning” (Yin, 2012: 5).  \nData collection from case study research usually involves the use of documents, \narchives, interviews, direct and participant observation, as well as physical artefacts \n(Zucker, 2009). The current research makes use of a qualitative interview process to \nstudy the members of the food garden, as well as the staff members. \nThere are different types of case studies. The type of case study that will be used for \nthe research is an instrumental case study. Stake (1995) notes that an instrumental \ncase study is used to provide insight into a particular issue (Zucker, 2009). The \npurpose is often to gain an in-depth understanding of its contexts and activities. The \nSiyakhana Initiative was used as the case study for urban food gardens in \nJohannesburg. It is used as an instrumental case study because the research looks \nat urban agriculture as a broader issue for consideration. Therefore the Siyakhana \nInitiative is used as a real-life illustration of urban agriculture taking place in urban \nareas of Johannesburg.  For that reason the study is concerned with all aspects \nwithin urban agriculture, however, in order to understand its context and how it is \npractised the use of a case study was important.   \nThe Siyakhana Initiative was formerly known as the Siyakhana Food Garden Project \nfacilitated by the University of the Witwatersrand’s Health Promotion Unit. The \nSiyakhana Permaculture Food Garden is located in the residential area of \nBezuidenhout Valley on the premises of the Bezuidenhout Park. The urban food \ngarden is situated on the fringes of the city centre, where development issues such \nas food insecurity, unemployment and poverty occupy the area (Nicolle, 2011).  \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n1.5.3 Data Collection  \nMethods Information required Data required Data Collection \nSub-questions \nWhat are the \nexpectations and \nexperiences of food \ngardens in reducing \nvulnerability of the \nurban poor? \n \nExperiences/challenges \nof people working \ninvolved in urban \nagriculture; \nImpacts of urban \nagriculture on the \nlivelihoods of the urban \npoor \nAdvantages/disadvantages \nof participating in urban \nagriculture; \nSpatial and institutional \nconsiderations for urban \nagriculture \nDrawing on literature \nexploring urban \nagriculture, vulnerability \nand livelihoods of the \nurban poor \nHow does Siyakhana \nrespond to the \nchallenges of the urban \npoor? \n \nAims, activities and future \nprospects of the \norganisation \nData on various \npartnerships Siyakhana is \ninvolved in; \nServices the initiative \nprovides; \nProcess of establishing a \nfood garden (resources, \nresponsibilities, funding) \nAnnual reports on \nSiyakhana (SIEHFS of \n2011); \nObservation of activities \nin the food garden; \nInterview with Siyakhana \npartners i.e.  the \nDirector/founder \nHow has involvement in \nSiyakhana impacted \nupon the livelihoods of \nits current members? \n \nHave the members \nbenefitted from the \ninitiative; \nRequire personal \ninformation about the \nlivelihoods of the \nmembers (prev. \nemployment status, food \nsecurity, etc.) \nAbility to provide meals to \nfor household; \nNo. of family members \nsupported; \nDifferent livelihood \nstrategies \n \nConduct 5-8 semi-\nstructured interviews with \nSiyakhana members; \nUtilise DFID framework to \nassess livelihoods of \nmembers by using data \nfrom interviews \n \nWhat are the \nimplications of \nSiyakhana experiences \nfor planning that are \nresponsive to the urban \npoor? \n \nHow urban planners can \nassist urban agriculture \nprojects such as food \ngardens; \nWhat are the \ncurrent/future plans for \nurban agriculture at policy \nlevel \nInformation on the process \nof establishing urban food \ngardens will assist in \nobtaining whether \nmunicipal planning plays \nany part in it and whether \nthere is a need for urban \npolicy to provide focus on \nurban agriculture as a \nlivelihoods strategy. \nLiterature on urban policy \nin Johannesburg (CoJ \nIDP and Joburg 2040); \nData on services \nprovided by Siyakhana; \nWhat processes are \ninvolved in urban food \ngardens; \nFuture prospects of \nSiyakhana;  \nViews of Siyakhana \nmembers and partners \nand how they feel urban \nplanning could play a role \nin urban food gardens; \nTable 1: Summary of data collection for the research according to \neach research question \n11 \n \n \nThe above table is a brief summary of the information and data needed for collection. \nIt describes how each question was answered for the study and how the information \nwas collected. It is important to note that the study focuses only on a single case \nstudy, thus findings might be limited. Therefore it is important to interview several \nmembers in order to gain a broad understanding of the issues at hand.  \nAn important part of the collection of data is the utilisation of the DFID Livelihoods \nFramework to the livelihoods of members by using data from the interviews. The \nlivelihoods framework is useful because it is able to analyse micro environments \nsuch as urban food gardens and can therefore show how households of different \ncategories are able to improve and become more resilient. \n1.5.4 Data Analysis  \nQualitative data analysis takes place when “a researcher is constructing a ‘reality’ \nwith his or her interpretations of a text provided by the subjects of research” (Schutt, \n2011: 322). Therefore, the purpose of qualitative data analysis is to understand the \npeople being studied and gain an understanding of their lives in natural settings. This \ntype of data analysis was important to the study because the research aims to use \nthe information from the data collection and to make sense of it through the \nperspectives of the Siyakhana gardeners themselves.  \nDuring the data analysis process, the researcher followed a process which enabled \nhim/her to interpret the data. The process involved:  \n1. Documentation of the data through transcribing each interview. Information \nwas written down on paper. \n \nMethods Information required Data required Data collection \nSub-questions \n   Interviews with one CoJ \nOfficial who will provide \nan understanding of their \nrole in assisting urban \nagricultural initiatives as \nwell as policy on it \n12 \n \n2. The data was thoroughly read through and important ideas and issues were \nhighlighted. \n3. Ideas and issues were sorted and categorised into various themes/concepts \nwhich were outlined in the DFID Livelihoods Framework (i.e. assets, \nstrategies and institutional factors). \n4. The data was then considered broadly to observe whether it can be related to \nany current issues and which may confirm or counter current literature on \ncertain issues.  \n5. Conclusions and recommendations were made.    \n1.6 Ethical Considerations \nFor the duration of the study, the research adhered to the Wits University procedures \nand principles regarding ethical considerations of the study. These principles and \nprocedures were thoroughly considered, particularly during the interview processes.  \nThe research took into account the context within which the study is being \nundertaken and recognised the sensitivity of certain individuals. Many of the \ngardeners with whom the research engaged may have been previously unemployed, \nhave experienced extreme hunger or may know what it feels like not being able to \nearn enough income to care for their families. Therefore, it is essential that the \nresearch considers the vulnerability of the gardeners with whom it engages.  \nA very important part in ethical concerns is how one communicates with the \nindividuals being studied. This could be how different forms are presented or the kind \nof language used when conducting an interview. There were two important factors to \nconsider for the following study. Firstly, for many of the gardeners, they may be living \nin what is considered as poverty, however, some may not consider themselves to be \npoor. It was important to consider what is said when having conversations with these \nindividuals or structuring interview questions in such a way as not to offend them. \nSecondly, many of the gardeners might not have had the opportunity to attend \nschool or may not be able to read. Therefore, careful consideration of how \ninformation is presented and how interview questions are conducted is important. \nThe level of language is an important factor. When drawing up consent and \ninformation sheets, the researcher ensured that it uses words that are easy to \n13 \n \nunderstand, so that participants are able to understand what they are getting \ninvolved in.  \nIn order to conduct the study, the research required the use of the following ethical \ntools:  \nParticipant Information Sheet (PIS) \n- The study began by drawing up a Participant Information Sheet which \nconveyed how confidentiality and anonymity was protected. This included \noutlining what was expected of the participant and the reassurance that \nhe/she is welcome to withdraw from the study at any time.  \n- The sheet indicated the purpose and a brief explanation of the topic of the \nstudy. \n- The Participant Information Sheet is an important ethical consideration \nbecause the research deals with investigating the livelihoods of the vulnerable \nwhich means that certain questions might be personal and may have an effect \non members of the initiative. Therefore the PIS gave them information into the \nprocesses within the study, which informed them in their decision to \nparticipate. \n- The PIS also included steps that may be taken if the participant feels unsafe \nor uncomfortable, such as immediate termination of the interview. \n- The sheet indicated that the study being conducted is only for academic use \nand that no participant may be rewarded for their involvement in the study.  \nFormal Consent Form \n- The Formal Consent Form was given to Siyakhana in order gain access to the \nsite and staff members. The Formal Consent Form was given to those \nmembers of Siyakhana who agreed to participate in the study, and agreed to \nbe interviewed. \nInformal consent \n- When the PIS and the Formal Consent Form was given it was important to \nverbally introduce myself as the researcher, what organization the research is \nconducted for, a brief description of what the study entails, etc.  \n14 \n \n1.7 Chapter Outline  \nChapter 1: Overview of the Study \nIn this chapter the research topic of Urban Food Gardens and Sustainable \nLivelihoods describes the background and introductory part of the report. This \nchapter discusses the problem statement; how the research topic is uniquely \npositioned amongst other research in the similar field and why the research is an \nimportant topic for study. The chapter describes the objectives of the study which \nlooks at what information the research intends to find. The chapter also elaborates \non the research design for the study. It discusses the research method chosen to \nassist in conducting the study and how the data was collected. In essence, this \nchapter is a summary of what the whole report is about and provides an outline for \nthe reader.  \nChapter 2: Literature Review  \nThis chapter discusses the various relevant literatures on urban agriculture and \nlivelihoods approaches. It discusses different concepts, arguments and criticisms of \nthese themes and how they have been practiced elsewhere. The chapter expands \non themes such as urban policy and planning, as well as vulnerability issues and \nhow they relate to urban agriculture. The chapter then developed a conceptual \nframework of the study and how it links to the research.  \nChapter 3:  Case Study: Overview \nThis chapter develops a profile of urban poverty in Johannesburg. It looks at the \nvarious challenges the city faces with relation to urban poverty and how it affects the \nlivelihoods of the poor. It discusses the various policies and approaches to poverty \nalleviation in the city and develops an understanding of the various livelihoods \nstrategies that are adopted in the city. Additionally, the chapter considers the various \nurban agriculture activities taking place in Johannesburg and closes by discussing \nthe case study for the research, which is the Siyakhana Initiative.     \nChapter 4: Presentation of Findings \nThis chapter presents the findings that have been collected on the Siyakhana \nInitiative in a coherent report. This means the key points and themes arising from the \n15 \n \ninterviews that have taken place with members of the Initiative. The chapter \ninterpreted the findings and discuss the relevance and importance of it.  \nChapter 5: Analysis of Findings \nThis chapter of the report presents a coherent discussion on the findings of the \ninterviews. It makes use of the DFID Sustainable Livelihoods Framework discussed \nin the literature review chapter and analyses the findings from the interview using \nthis framework as a tool. Therefore it linked the findings to vulnerability, assets and \nlivelihoods strategies of the gardeners. This chapter represents an important section \nof the report as it begins to draw conclusions to the study.  \nChapter 6: Conclusions and Recommendations \nThis chapter concludes the report by answering the research question and sub-\nquestions and begins to summarise and make recommendations. This chapter \nrelates the findings to urban planning and how it can be applied as a solution to the \nsituation within the topic.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \n2 Chapter Two: Literature Review \nThis chapter aims to understand the various concepts, approaches and debates \nregarding the experiences and challenges of urban food gardens and their impacts \non the livelihoods of the urban poor. This section discusses the scholarship relating \nto urban agriculture (UA) and sustainable livelihoods (SL). Both urban agriculture \nand sustainable livelihoods are contextually linked, especially with regards to \nvulnerability. While urban agriculture proposes a strategy for urban poverty \nreduction, SL is regarded as the outcome. This relationship is central to the \nconceptualisation of the research because the purpose of the study is to make a \ncase for urban agriculture as a strategy to improve the livelihoods of the poor. What \nthe research aims to prove is that urban agriculture can create sustainable \nlivelihoods, because it is able to provide benefits holistically – that is social, \neconomic and environmental benefits.  \nThe chapter also investigates the response by local governments to the possibilities \npresented by urban agriculture, and what adopting urban agriculture as a formal \npolicy intervention may mean for urban planning.  \n2.1 Urban Agriculture and Vulnerable Households \n2.1.1 Urban Agriculture \nWhile urban food production is well established in cities of the developing world, the \nconcept of urban agriculture has only recently gained momentum (Rogerson, 1993). \nSocial and economic issues, such as poverty and unemployment, which are \nprevalent in developing countries have led people to adopt survival tactics to fight \nagainst poverty and vulnerability. People have adopted urban farming as a means to \nfeed their families or derive an income for their households. As a result, the impact of \nurban agriculture has been argued by many researchers as an important strategy in \npoverty alleviation. \nThe growing interest in urban agriculture has led researchers to adopt various \ndefinitions of the concept. Smit et al. (2001:1) defined urban agriculture as “an \nindustry that produces processes and markets food and fuel on land and water \ndispersed throughout the urban and peri-urban area.” This is a very brief description \n17 \n \nof urban agriculture and might not be appropriate in every situation. The definition \ndescribes the ‘how’ and ‘where’ aspects of urban agriculture and leaves out the \n‘what’ and ‘who’ aspects such as crops, livestock, and fish. \nMost definitions of urban agriculture involve the production and cultivation of food \ncrops, herbs, flowers, livestock or fishing and that this occurs within the city or on the \nurban periphery (George, 2013). This is correct, but more recently, urban agriculture \nhas come to encompass a number of other activities as well. Ngcamphalala (2013) \nasserts that urban agriculture now also includes those activities such as the \nprocessing, marketing and trading of the urban farming produce.  \nUrban agriculture encompasses more than subsistence farming which is commonly \nundertaken by poor urban households. It also involves production, processing at \nhousehold level, through to commercialised agriculture (FAO, 2007). For example, \nthe Bambanani Food and Herb Garden located in the suburb of Bertrams in \nJohannesburg sells cheap organic vegetables to the local community, to street \nhawkers and the Bertrams Spar supermarket. Thus, urban agriculture has the \npotential to go beyond food security (where farmers only use the produce they grow \nto feed their families) but rather that income can be generated from the produce. In \naddition, urban agriculture concerns more than produce. Urban agriculture has the \npotential to be profitable because of the diversity of its activities. Therefore, a \ndefinition of urban agriculture must consider all those aspects that are important for \nthe research.   \nFor the research, it was important to use a definition that is unique to the particular \nsituation which is urban agriculture practised in response to social, economic and \nenvironmental insecurities. Therefore the study utilised a definition adjusting both \nGeorge (2013) and Ngcamphalala’s (2013) description. The definition that is used for \nthe study is:  \nUrban agriculture is the practice of farming, processing, marketing and trading \nof produce such as livestock, food crops, herbs, or aquaculture etc. within \nurban and peri-urban areas, often in response to crisis or vulnerability of \nurban populations.  \n18 \n \nHowever, the research focused on that aspect of urban agriculture that involves \nurban food gardening. This means farming with fruits and vegetables or herbs. This \nis known as horticulture. According to Smit et al. (2001) horticulture is the process of \nfarming with fruits, vegetables and compost in locations such as parks, roof-tops, \nwetlands and greenhouses. \n2.1.2 Urban Agriculture and Vulnerability \nVulnerability is an important aspect of the research. Therefore the concept of \nvulnerability in relation to urban poverty and urban agriculture requires attention in \norder to understand its meaning within the study. Phillip and Rayan (2004) note that \nthere are two approaches to vulnerability: the biophysical approach which involves \nvulnerability to environmental conditions; and the political economic approach which \ninvolves the idea that human beings are entitled to certain things such as food and \nthe idea that marginalisation is a form of vulnerability. In essence, on the one hand, \nvulnerability encompasses factors such as climate change and natural disasters that \ncan make people vulnerable to danger and loss; and on the other hand, it includes \nfactors such as food insecurity, malnutrition and income generation. \nIncome poverty is part of vulnerability. Not having access to a constant income \nhinders an individual’s ability to purchase food or to provide for their health needs \nand other aspects required to achieve a full life. Income is thus an important factor \nfor the livelihoods of households. However, it is also important to bear in mind that it \nis not the only measure of vulnerability. For example, the well-being of a person \ncannot only be measured by a person’s level of income but must consider the level \nof his/her utility (happiness or satisfaction) and political situation (civil rights) \n(Pramono and Woltjer, 2011). Therefore, a household can be considered vulnerable, \nwhen it is deprived of one or more of these factors.   \nDeprivations hinder an individual’s ability to perform an array of human functionings \nand are linked to vulnerability. Masika (1997) notes that analysis of poverty must \nfocus more broadly on assets and exclusion, and it has been argued that the low-\nincome of urban residents is not only the reason for the deprivations they \nexperience. The blame has been placed on the lack of capacity from the private and \npublic sector in reducing poverty and that many governments in fact contribute to \nimpoverishment by enacting restrictive and unreasonable regulations or through \n19 \n \neviction and harassing informal traders. However, while this may be true, it is \nimportant to realise that income plays a significant role in the lives of urban dwellers \nbecause of the higher costs of living and different contexts in which they live, as \nopposed to rural areas. Therefore, income must be considered to play a large role in \nthe vulnerability of the poor. \nVulnerability refers to the absence or insufficiency of assets and/or capabilities \nnecessary to overcome/address the shocks and stresses of life. Moser (1998: 11) \nrefers to the importance of exploring vulnerability and how it can lead to “resilience or \nresponsiveness in exploiting opportunities and resisting or recovering from the \nnegative effects of a changing environment”. People living in poverty are often \nconsidered vulnerable because they are not capable of guarding themselves against \nshocks or disasters. For example, for many people, even though there is \nemployment available in an area, they might not be employed because of lack of skill \nand education. Sen (2005: 153) asserts that “capability allows us to distinguish \nappropriately between (i) whether a person is actually able to do things she would \nvalue doing, and (ii) whether she possesses the means or instruments or \npermissions to pursue what she would like to do”.  \nCapabilities and assets are closely related. On the one hand, the concept of \ncapability means that an individual/household/community has the ability or potential \nrealise their “human functionings” (Sen, 2005: 153). On the other hand, assets are \ncharacterised as those “material (money, goods, and infrastructure), or non-material \n(health, knowledge, skills/abilities, relationships, organization, social environment, \npolitical condition, property right or access rights…” (Pramano and Woltjer, 2011:  9). \nThe idea is that an individual will benefit from having access to these assets, \ntherefore allowing an individual to achieve his/her capabilities.    \nUnderstanding capabilities is important because it helps to recognise why people are \nliving in poverty, why they are food insecure, unable to generate income or are \nsuffering from malnutrition. For example, just because employment generation may \nbe a result of economic development, does not mean that people are able to find \njobs. An individual needs to be capable of finding a job; which means he or she must \nhave the skills or qualifications to be suitable for a certain occupation. It also helps to \n20 \n \nunderstand the livelihood strategies people have adopted in order to respond to their \nvulnerability.  \nFood insecurity and malnutrition are vulnerabilities often faced by the urban poor. \nVan der Merwe (2011: 1) describes food security “as physical and economic access \nto sufficient, safe and nutritious foods which meet an individual’s dietary needs and \npreferences for an active and healthy life”. He also notes key dimensions of urban \nhousehold food security, two of which are food availability and food access (Van der \nMerwe, 2011). Amar-Klemesu (2000) states that access to food has a larger impact \non food insecurity than the availability of food and that there are three issues \naffecting access. Firstly, macroeconomic aspects such as food policies result in the \nrise of food prices, making access to food an even greater concern for poor \nhouseholds. In South Africa, for example, the poor spend 37 percent more on food \ndue to the rise in prices of maize, and dairy products (Van der Merwe, 2011).  \nSecondly, there is employment and cash income. Poor households often do not have \nformal employment which makes generating income difficult. The Global Food \nSecurity Index of 2014 notes that in many developing countries, the lack of basic \ninfrastructure and income affect people’s ability to afford an access nutritious food \n(The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2014). It was found in an urban food security study \non Cape Town, Msunduzi and Johannesburg that there is a close relation between \nincome levels and food security. The study indicated that households with the lowest \nincome had the highest levels of food insecurity (Frayne et al. 2009).  \nLastly, food insecurity is affected by markets and food prices. A major reason for \nfood insecurity in urban areas is the increases in food prices. Phillip and Rayan \n(2004) discuss the notion of economic vulnerability where vulnerability is associated \nwith trade and foreign exchange and the effects on international prices for \ncommodities. Often various economic forces affect food prices and in turn negatively \naffect food security in a country. The Health, Environment and Development study \nreviewed levels of food insecurity in an informal settlement in Johannesburg. It was \nfound that between the periods of 2006 and 2012, there was a drop in food insecurity \nlevels (from 85% to 71%). However it was also noted that there was a significant rise \nin food insecurity (91%) in 2009 due to a rise in global food prices (Naicker et al. \n2015). Similarly, in a survey done on food insecurity in the areas of the inner city of \n21 \n \nJohannesburg, Alexandra and Orange Farm, it was found that more than half of \nhouseholds stated that they went without food once a month as a result of food that \nwas unaffordable (Rudolph et al. 2012).                  \nFood insecurity and nutrition are issues that are often related to urban agriculture. \nUrban agriculture is argued to present a means through which people are able to \nreduce vulnerability by increasing access to food of the urban poor. Urban \nagriculture is an activity that may be regarded as a sustainable way of making a \nliving.   \nOn a social level, urban agriculture has been argued to improve livelihoods because \nit creates food security and nutrition for poor households (Battersby, 2010). Through \nfood production urban agriculture is able to provide poor households with immediate \nhousehold needs, such as nutritious fruits and vegetables which can present poor \nhouseholds with a buffer against extreme hunger and malnutrition. Urban dwellers \nalso benefit by saving on food purchasing costs, which can be used for important \nneeds such as health.  \nHuman health is an important asset that individuals rely on to stay alive. A large part \nof that involves the types and quality of food that people should consume every day. \nTherefore, food security has more to do with the categories of food people have \naccess to rather than simply access to any kind of food. In order for an individual to \nbe food secure, he/she needs to have access to nutritious food for a decent \nlivelihood. This may include consuming all the necessary food groups on a daily \nbasis. Urban agriculture makes access to nutritious food easier because urban \nfarmers do not have to rely on expensive store-bought items, when they can produce \nhealthy food themselves. Increases in food prices have forced the urban poor to find \nother alternatives given that they spend most of their money on food purchases. \nNugent (1999: 72) notes that the “removal of subsidies and price controls, \naccompanying structural adjustment policies in the 1980s and 1990s” have led to \nsignificant increases in food prices which have forced people to provide food through \nhome production. Crush et al. (2010) support the argument that households who \ngrow their own food seemed to be more food secure and were nutritiously healthier \nthan others.  \n22 \n \nOn an economic level the proponents argue that urban agriculture represents a way \nfor poor households to sustain a livelihood by producing food as an income-\ngenerating strategy. Richards and Taylor (2012) point out that globally, \napproximately 200 million urban residents produce their own food for urban markets \nand that urban agriculture is a useful way for a household to generate income and \nemployment for themselves. Like food insecurity, unemployment is a cause for \nconcern for many cities in southern Africa. Employment is one of the main ways in \nwhich urban households are able to derive an income for themselves and being \nunemployed leaves many vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty. Urban \nagriculture presents an opportunity for urban residents to use as an alternative or \nadditional measure to the more commonly practiced employment generation \nstrategies.  \n Urban poverty is not something that will disappear very soon and urban agriculture \nhas been the response for many people. Nugent (1999) notes surveys done in \nseveral cities in Africa. An investigation was made on the reasons why people \nparticipated in urban agriculture and the majority of the responses were related to \neconomic benefits and income was one reason. It was noted that income generated \nsignificantly motivated people to farm. For example in Lusaka, people who had their \nown home gardens produced almost three months worth of income at the average \nworker level in 1992 (Nugent, 1999). \nAs mentioned before, not only do urban households have the opportunity to generate \nincome, they are able to save income that can be used to purchase these fruits and \nvegetables. The location of urban agriculture is also beneficial for urban farmers. \nDrechsel et al. (2008) note that the market proximity of urban agriculture allows \nfarmers to easily monitor price developments and reduces transportation costs.     \nA small amount of research has been dedicated to the environmental benefits of \nurban agriculture. Most arguments regarding the environmental aspects of urban \nagriculture have looked at the possible damaging ecological effects of it. However \nauthors like Heather (2012) note that using vacant lots for urban agriculture can \nprovide a number of environmental benefits. Vacant lots can be harmful (attracting \ncrime and pollution) and can put a strain on the local economies of city. Developing \nurban agriculture on vacant lots can reduce pollution by greening the buildings and \n23 \n \ncan promote some aspects of health for farmers and the surroundings (Heather, \n2012).  \nSmit et al. (2001) assert that urban farming reduces pollution and protects the \nenvironment by contributing to waste management and by conserving resources. \nThey also discuss the fact that in many low-income countries, cities are faced with \nextreme pollution of air, water and soil, reduced biodiversity, and risk of disasters. It \nis argued that through urban food production cities are able to reduce the negative \nimpacts of population growth and expansion.  \nGiven the numerous ways in which it can benefit the urban poor and the \nenvironment, a strong case can be made for urban agriculture as a strategy to \nalleviate poverty and create sustainable livelihoods. Urban agriculture contributes to \nenhanced skills and training; it can be environmentally sustainable with the reuse of \nland and resources and innovations in technology can contribute to reduced energy \nusage and expenditure; and food produced is usually low cost, good quality and \naccessible (Quon, 1999). Evidence has shown that it has a positive impact in the \nlivelihoods of urban households.  \nHowever, others argue that we must take caution when disputing the benefits of \nurban agriculture. White and Hamm (2014) point to the fact that even though it \npresents an appealing approach to food security and income generation, various \nauthors believe that we need to be careful, as urban agriculture neglects various \nurban issues. For White and Hamm (2014: 3), urban agriculture neglects the fact that \n“poor people do not have access or have only insecure access to productive \nresources in an urban environment”. Here it is being argued that urban agriculture \nmight not create the expected benefits for many of the urban poor because of their \nability to access certain urban goods. Crush et al. (2010) indicate that opponents of \nurban agriculture have said that it is given too much credit in terms of offering food \nsecurity because there is not enough evidence to prove that poor people derive any \nbenefit from urban agriculture.  \nWhite and Hamm (2014: 3) also note that “municipal officials are often antagonistic \ntowards urban agriculture for a number of reasons. For example, they are cautious \nabout hygiene and safe food production and proper use of city space. However, \nMougeot (1998) asserts that some of the risks of urban agriculture have been \n24 \n \nexaggerated and that more attention is given to how these risks can be mitigated. \nBut even though the risks of urban agriculture can be managed, cities need to make \nbetter use of prevention measures to adequately enhance the environment \n(Mougeot, 1998)           \nDespite the fact that urban agriculture has flaws, the activity is still practised by \nhouseholds in many countries of the developing world as a buffer from extreme \nimpoverishment. White and Hamm (2014) report that although families who worked \nin the Philippi Horticulture Area of Cape Town were still considered to be food \ninsecure, it was noted that without the produce and income derived from the \nhorticulture area, the households would be in a worse state. It is clear that people all \nover the developing world rely heavily on urban agriculture. Onyango (2010) \nobserves that urban agriculture can be found in almost every city in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and it “arises from the need for solutions to wide range of problems” \n(Onyango, 2010: 39).  \n2.2 The Response of Urban Planning to Urban Agriculture \n2.2.1 Making a Case for Urban Agriculture in City Planning \nAlthough urban agriculture is gradually being recognised as playing an important role \nin poverty alleviation in urban areas, it is still not being integrated into agricultural \npolicies and the urban planning of cities (De Zeeuw et al. 2011). White and Hamm \n(2014) note that those involved in urban farming need to collaborate with municipal \nofficials to develop strategies that cater to the specific requirements of food \nprovisioning if cities are going to feed those working in urban food systems in a \nhealthy and safe manner. Van Staden (2014: 116) noted that in order for urban food \nproduction to remain sustainable and feasible, the “professional industry, academic \nenvironment and city administration” need to offer more support if people are going \nto benefit. \nDe Zeeuw et al. (2011: 3) note that there are various constraints that affect \ndevelopment of urban agriculture. These constraints are:  \n- prohibitive urban planning policies and regulations; \n- limited access to productive resources and insecure land tenure; \n25 \n \n- lack of support services; and \n- lack of organisation among urban farmers. \nOne of the most significant contributions to poverty in many cities in Africa is the lack \nof support from local governments and urban planning in the livelihood strategies of \nthe poor. This is particularly evident in the informal sector. The state is often hostile \ntowards this sector because it does not fit the ideal vision cities value. The \nresponses to urban informality have either been through slum upgrading and land \ntitling (Roy, 2005) or through eviction. In the same way, municipal governments are \nnot very enthusiastic about urban agriculture for reasons that often can be mitigated \nand managed. Many of these reasons are related to environmental concerns and \nwere mentioned previously in the chapter.    \nMubvami and Mushamba (2006) believe that urban planning must incorporate and \nembrace UA in its plans and policies because it provides a number of benefits for the \ncity. Apart from functioning as a means to alleviate vulnerability issues in cities, UA \ncan reduce transportation costs of produce because it is undertaken in urban areas. \nUrban planners are key players in land use and the built environment which is aimed \nat developing a desired future for cities and that has the interests of the public good \nin mind (Quon, 1999). \nThere are certain resources that urban agriculture needs in order to remain \nsustainable and feasible as a poverty alleviation strategy. Most of these elements \nare the mandate of municipal governments. Municipal governments control access to \nresources and infrastructure development within their jurisdictions. Therefore they \nare in the best position to support urban food strategies (White and Hamm, 2014). \nWith appropriate support from municipal governments urban agriculture may be able \nto be more responsive to urban poverty and food insecurity. This means that local \ngovernment needs to become involved in urban food strategies on a number of \nlevels. For instance, urban agriculture needs to be incorporated into the planning \nprocess. By integrating urban agriculture into the planning process of a city, urban \nagriculture will be able to benefit from the infrastructure and services needed for it to \nflourish and properly respond to urban conditions.   \nBecause land also plays an important role in urban agriculture and because local \ngovernments have control over land and how it is utilised they also need to play a \n26 \n \npart in making it easier for people to access land for food production. Garret (2008) \nasserts that city planning need to make urban land available for growing food and \nthat this needs to be done by finding ways to utilise unused land in order to make it \nmore productive and profitable through urban agriculture. In order for land to be \nmade available, it needs to be prioritised in urban planning policies. Howe (2002) \ndescribes the challenge of urban food production coming under threat by pressure to \ndevelop land for other purposes such as housing developments and that planning \nneeds to “go a lot further in terms of a pro-active approach to promoting the \nallocation of inner city spaces for food production” (Garret, 2008: 8). There is thus a \nneed for local government to regard land for urban agriculture as equally as it would \nfor any other development. For example, city officials consent to a number of green \nopen spaces such as parks or golf courses. In the same way, urban agriculture \nshould be integrated into the planning process (De Zeeuw et al. 2011). \nOther than land, there are other factors that need to be considered if urban \nagriculture is to be a sustainable practice. Technology and innovation plays an \nimportant part in the sustainable use of energy and resources. According to Van \nStaden (2014: 115), “Technology, whether in the form of tunnels, automated \nirrigation composting or aquaponics, can sustainably intensify production”. \nComposting plays a major role in urban farming. Through technological innovation \nurban farmers are able to use biomass recycling for producing compost. Methods \nlike these demonstrate the sustainable practices needed in urban agriculture. \nHowever, in order to incorporate the technologies needed for urban agriculture, \nfarmers need financial, resource and knowledge support.  \nPart of the reason why urban agriculture is not able to adequately help the poor is \nbecause most urban farmers have to rely on their own resources and abilities to \ngrow food. In order for urban agriculture to be sustainable, it needs to be supported \nby state and developmental agencies. For example, according to City Farmer News, \nin 2009 Affordable Housing Company (Afhco) (the property management division of \nthe Afhco Group) partnered with the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) in \ndeveloping a roof-top vegetable garden pilot project. The JDA assisted ADHCO with \nfinancial resources in order to obtain the necessary tools and installations to get the \ngarden project underway.     \n27 \n \nOn the one hand, it will be important that local governments provide support via \nfacilitating access to information on innovative farming technologies. And on the \nother, urban agriculture needs to be incorporated into agricultural policy which will \nensure financial and resource support from the national of government (De Zeeuw et \nal. 2011).  Integrating urban agriculture into urban policy is an important way of \nprioritising urban food production strategies. Once urban agriculture is adopted in \nurban policy, local governments can begin to implement programmes aimed at \nreducing urban poverty through urban food production.  \nHavana, Cuba, for example, boasts one of the most successful models of UA in the \nworld. Almost 35 000 hectares of land is used for UA in Havana. It spreads across \nthe entire province of the city and also includes the city’s urban fringes and suburban \nareas (Novo and Murphy, 1998). Although UA in Havana is not directly a response to \nurban poverty, it is a response to a shock that the country and its people faced. \nUrban agriculture in Havana developed out of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which \nmeant the end of trade with Comecon, which is an organisation established in 1949 \nto facilitate and coordinate the economic development of the eastern European \ncountries belonging to the Soviet bloc. This meant that the country started to run \nshort of vital resources including petroleum, agricultural machinery and fertilizers. \nPeople therefore responded with UA because, urban production reduced the costs of \ntransporting and encouraged production to take place near living areas to reduce \nfood costs (Novo and Murphy, 1998) which improves accessibility. In addition, the \nurban agriculture programme in Havana includes a set of sub-programmes dealing \nwith crops, livestock and various support areas. These sub-programmes have \ncontributed to a number of jobs in the city. More than 350 000 jobs have been \ncreated as a result of the programme and its most successful sub-programme – the \ngrowing of fresh vegetables and herbs – increased in production from 4000 tons in \n1994 to 4,2 million in 2005 (Novo and Murphy, 1998). Although the development of \nurban agriculture in Havana is grounded in a different context to that of cities in \nAfrica, the benefits of the activity is still evident. Not only does it have the ability to \nprovide nutritional food, it can also contribute to generating thousands of jobs for \npeople. \nOther examples of urban agriculture include the Izindaba Zokudla (Conversations \nabout Food) project which is located in Soweto, Johannesburg. According to \n28 \n \nArchitecture Otherwhere Durban (2014), the Izindaba Zokudla project is a multi-\nstakeholder engagement that is aimed at creating opportunities for urban farmers in \nSoweto as well as sustainable food production. The Design Society Development \n(DSD) Community of Practice at the University of Johannesburg is involved in the \nproject. The project has led the City of Johannesburg to implement an urban \nagriculture policy that is aimed at multi-stakeholder engagement between the city, \nand urban farmers in urban food systems.      \nPossibilities for urban agriculture have been provided in some South African policies. \nIn the National Strategy on Sustainable Development and Action Plan 2011-2014, \nsome of its interventions include Promoting conservation farming, permaculture and \norganic farming and increasing support to urban good growing initiatives, but the \npolicy does not indicate any specific strategies regarding urban agriculture. Support \nfor urban agriculture has been outlined in the City of Johannesburg IDP (2012), and \nthe Joburg 2040 Strategy aims to respond to a number of issues through a \nsustainable services cluster. The aim is to promote and support urban agriculture in \norder to address food scarcity. Urban agriculture is also a component in one of the \ncity’s key flagship programmes where, in the medium term the city aims to focus on \nfood security and urban agriculture.  \nThe City of Cape Town has implemented its urban agriculture policy since 2007. The \npolicy focuses on agricultural activities undertaken by the poorest people and \ndiscusses a number of strategies that will assist the development of urban \nagriculture in the city. An important strategic objective is the City’s aim to include \nurban agriculture in land use management and physical planning. By incorporating \nurban agriculture into physical planning, it is able to obtain more support from the \nCity because land and resources will be prioritised for it.       \nThere is a good argument for urban agriculture, and authors have outlined its \nbenefits, and there are clear attempts at incorporating it into policy development. \nHowever, some authors still argue that there is a lack of support from municipal \ngovernment and urban planning.     \nIf we look at cities today, there is always a competition to be the best and many cities \nfocus on creating an image and often urban planners are at the origin of these plans. \nCities and branding have become a crucial part of a continuously modernising world. \n29 \n \nKavaratzis and Ashworth (2005) argue that the purpose of place branding is to \ncreate distinctiveness of a location or city and to show that what it has to offer makes \nit better than other cities (Kavaratzis and Ashworth, 2005). \nThe City of Johannesburg has branded itself as a World-class African City and often \nbrands such as these come with expected perceptions of what the city should be and \nlook like or different ideas and plans in order to create the envisioned city status. \nThese brands have placed emphasis on the image of the city, therefore, it is \nessential that anything that does not adhere to the city’s image, must be removed. \nThis can be related to the idea of modernisation, which can be understood as the \nimperative that people with traditional cultures must change these lifestyles and \nadopt the western culture. Many people perceive the western culture to be \nprogressive and that by adopting these approaches will ensure economic \ndevelopment (Onyango, 2010). Anything that opposes this must be rejected. Urban \nagriculture is viewed in a similar light where the farming practices of the urban poor \nare seen as traditional and not seen as advanced, and therefore is often not \nsupported by local governments and urban planners. \nOnyango (2010) notes the constraints that limit the development of safe and \nsustainable urban agriculture. These constraints include lack of support services, \nlimited recognition of its value by city officials; and lack of formal recognition of \nfarmers (Onyango, 2010). One of the constraints is that urban agriculture is not \nrecognised within the modern developing city. Local government’s attitude towards \nurban agriculture is derived from the belief that agriculture is a traditional practice \nand that it should be left to rural areas. The lack of recognition, negative perceptions \nand decision-making stimulated by growth and profit accumulation has led to uneven \ndevelopment, where certain interests are privileged over others. \n2.3 Sustainable Livelihoods Framework: DFID  \nThis section develops an appropriate analytical model through which to assess and \ninvestigate the Siyakhana Initiative. The study argues that urban agriculture can be \nconsidered a sustainable livelihoods approach, therefore the research assesses \nSiyakhana against this model as well as what this means for urban planning. The \nsection relates to sub-question two and three (indicated in Chapter One) which \n30 \n \ninvolves the findings of the research that are used to evaluate Siyakhana in creating \nsustainable livelihoods for the urban poor.      \nThe section develops a common understanding of the Sustainable Livelihoods \nFramework and how it can be understood in relation to UA. The section develops an \nappropriate definition for the livelihoods model and explains why this was to used to \nassess the case study. The section also derives a set of principles by which the case \nstudy findings are analysed and discusses the impact of these principles upon local \ngovernments and urban planners.  \n2.3.1 Sustainable livelihoods approach and Urban Agriculture \nIn order to understand sustainable livelihoods, it is important to develop an \nunderstanding of what a livelihood is, how it is commonly understood, and what it \nmeans in the current research. One of the most common definitions of livelihoods is \nChamber and Conway’s (1991: i): “A livelihood comprises the capabilities, assets \n(stores, resources, claims and access) and activities required for a means of living.” \nThis definition describes how people develop a livelihood for themselves, but it does \nnot consider socio-economic and environmental implications of livelihoods. \nTherefore, the research must adopt a definition of livelihoods that is more suited and \nconsiderate of sustainability. Thus, a livelihood is defined as:  \n \nPeople’s capacity to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance \ntheir well-being, and that of future generations. These capacities are \ncontingent upon the availability and accessibility of options which are \necological, economic and political and which are predicated on equity, \nownership of resources and participatory decision making (De Satge, 2002: \n4).   \n \nThe Sustainable Livelihoods concept was introduced into global policy discourse \nwhen the Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development identified it as a \ngoal for poverty alleviation. Sustainable livelihoods now consider those factors that \neither limit or improve poor people’s capabilities that enable them to develop a \nlivelihood in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable way (Krantz, \n2001).  \n31 \n \n \nAccording to Carney (1999) livelihoods approaches are people-centred: they assist \npeople in developing their own potential while also taking into account the need for \npolicy and institutional support. The research investigates whether urban agriculture \ncan create sustainable livelihoods. There are a number of aspects that confirm urban \nagriculture to be a sustainable livelihoods approach. Farrington et al. (2002) note \nthat sustainable livelihoods analysis requires qualitative research tools, which relates \nto the research methods used for this study. Farrington et al. (2002: 42) assert that \nthe approach must encompass the following:  \n- Sustainable livelihoods approaches concentrate on concepts related to \nvulnerability, social capital or institutional processes and relations which \ncannot be usefully quantified  \n- people-centred focus of SL approaches, which means that research needs to \nbe based on participatory approaches and thus makes a pre-defined research \nagenda difficult \n- The need to highlight the priorities and rationales of poor women and men in \npursuing their livelihoods – information which only can be attracted through \nqualitative approaches. \n  \nThe concept of urban agriculture explored in the research relates to the above \nmentioned points in the sense that similar concepts have been explored. For \nexample, vulnerability has been explored in the research in relation to how urban \nagriculture is able to reduce food insecurity and poverty. Urban agriculture is also a \nlivelihood strategy for many poor households and the reasons why it is pursued has \nbeen previously discussed.  \n \nAssessing urban agriculture against sustainable livelihoods is important for the \nresearch because it helps to understand how it is able to create sustainable \nlivelihoods for the poor as well as what the implications are and what is necessary \nfor it to be a successful approach. The figure below indicates the principles outlined \nin the DFID Sustainable Livelihoods Framework.  \n  \n      \n \n32 \n \nPeople-centred: People rather than the resources they use are the priority concern in the \nlivelihoods approach, since problems associated to development often root in adverse institutional \nstructures impossible to be overcome through simple asset creation. \nHolistic: A holistic view is aspired in understanding the stakeholders’ livelihoods as a whole, with \nall its facets, by a manageable model that helps to identify the most pressing constraints people \nhave to face. \nDynamic: Just as people's livelihoods and the institutions that shape their life are highly dynamic, \nso is the approach in order to learn from changes and help mitigating negative impacts, whilst \nsupporting positive effects. \nBuilding on strengths: A central issue of the approach is the recognition of everyone's inherent \npotential for his/her removal of constraints and realisation of potentials. Identifying these strengths \nrather than the needs and problems is the starting point of this approach, in order to contribute to \nthe stakeholders’ robustness and ability to achieve their own objectives. \nMacro-micro links: Development activity tends to focus at either the macro or the micro level, \nwhereas the SLA tries to bridge this gap in stressing the links between the two levels. As people \nare often affected from decisions at the macro policy level and vice-versa, this relation needs to be \nconsidered in order to achieve sustainable development. \nSustainability: A livelihood can be classified as sustainable, if it is resilient in the face of external \nshocks and stresses, if it is independent from external support, if it is able to maintain the long-\nterm productivity of natural resources and if it does not undermine the livelihood options of others. \n \n(Kollmair et al., 2002) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe first principle is that a sustainable livelihood approach needs to be people-\ncentred. On the one hand urban agriculture can be considered people-centred \nbecause a great deal of the research done on the topic focuses on the poor and how \nthey can benefit and improve their livelihoods through urban food production. On the \nother hand, in order for urban agriculture to be considered a sustainable livelihoods \napproach, the poor need to be given a voice. For example, if local government is to \nincorporate plans for urban agriculture within policy, it would need to consider a \nbottom-up approach where the needs and views of the people are taken into \naccount.  Participatory and bottom-up approaches in policy making can be \nconsidered more effective in creating sustainable development at the local level \n(Nicolle, 2011). For example, if urban agriculture is going to be people-centred, local \nFigure A: Livelihoods framework core principles (GLOPP, \n2008) \n \n33 \n \ngovernment must incorporate the poor through community-based projects, public \nparticipation, or public-private partnerships.  \nThe second principle is that the approach needs to be holistic. Farrington et al. \n(2002) assert that if a sustainable livelihoods approach is going to achieve its \nobjectives it needs to be based on the fact that people adopt a variety of livelihood \nstrategies and rely on various assets for survival. If urban agriculture is going to be \nconsidered within urban planning and development it needs to become multi-sectoral \nin that it is able to diversify its activities and become more than a food security \nstrategy. A sustainable livelihoods approach may also be considered to be holistic in \nthe sense that it forms a deeper analysis of poverty in that it considers the fact that it \nis more than lack of income and that it also includes vulnerability, lack of basic \ninfrastructure, health and access to assets (Farrington et al. 2002).    \nThe third principle is that it needs to be dynamic. If people are to adequately benefit \nfrom urban agriculture, support from organisations or institutions need to develop an \nunderstanding of the dynamic nature of the livelihoods of the people and how they \nhave been able to reduce their vulnerability. Carney (1999: 13) notes that “external \nsupport must recognise the dynamic nature of livelihoods strategies, respond flexibly \nto changes in people’s situation and develop longer-term commitments”. Therefore, \nfor urban agricultural initiatives to assist poor households to overcome vulnerability, \nthey will need organisational structures that are able to support them for long periods \nof time. For example, if a project depends highly upon the income derived from the \nproduce grown, it will need external support because benefits are often accrued \nseasonally.  \nThe fourth principle is that the approach must build on the strengths of people. Urban \nagriculture has the potential to build on people’s strength and assist them in using it \nto improve their livelihoods. Many of the people have received training in farming and \nbasic agricultural activities, such as in Siyakhana and Bambanani as mentioned \npreviously. Training individuals in farming practices helps improve the sustainability \nof an urban agricultural activity and develops human capital of individuals.  \nMacro-micro links are important in successful sustainable livelihoods approaches. \nThey help link the perspectives of people on the ground to that in policy \ndevelopment. It is not sustainable, for example, to develop a strategy on urban \n34 \n \nagriculture without the inputs and consideration of the needs of those at whom the \npolicy is directed. Therefore, support for urban agriculture needs to create a link \nbetween those involved in urban farming and those involved in the development of \nnew policy. It has also been indicated that it is not sufficient to focus exclusively on \nthe micro context, but that the macro perspective plays a significant role in \nlivelihoods. If a flood occurs, various capitals will be affected by processes and \nstructures that are in place. For example, physical assets may be lost and \nvulnerability might depend upon how emergency feeding and employment systems \nare implemented (Farrington et al. 2002).      \nThe last principle is that it needs to be sustainable. Urban agriculture has been \nargued to be sustainable in that it incorporates aspects on social, economic and \nenvironmental levels. Heather (2012: 1) notes that “…urban farms are known to \nprovide a number of social, health, economic and environmental benefits.”  However, \nurban agricultural activities may not survive long enough without the support from \ninstitutional structures, which may provide capital or resources.       \nCarney (1999) discusses sustainable livelihood approaches and believes that SL \nthinking is much more than the economic benefits of poverty reduction and income \ngeneration. She believes that SL approaches provide a social benefit for the poor \nwhich goes as far as giving the poor a voice. This relates to Nicolle’s (2011) \nassertion that UA provides more than economic impacts and gives the urban poor a \nsense of empowerment. Empowerment means to provide people with the “skills and \nknowledge that will enable them to challenge normative values and engage more \ndeeply in political, social and economic activities” (Diepeveen, 2008: 8). This relates \nto the fact that urban agriculture is able to go beyond simply survival and can give \nthose involved in it a sense of purpose.  \nThose who participate in urban agriculture have the opportunity to learn agricultural \nskills such as horticultural knowledge or learn about the soil. The skills and training \nthey receive can benefit them in the long term and empowers them to apply what \nthey have learnt elsewhere. However, in order for the urban poor to genuinely \nbecome empowered, there is a need for institutional support. Richards and Taylor \n(2012) noted in a study conducted in four urban centres in South Africa that urban \nfarmers felt that they were not receiving the required technical support that would \n35 \n \nallow them to obtain the knowledge and training they needed for agricultural \nsustainability.   \n2.3.2 Livelihoods Framework \nThe livelihoods framework is a research tool used to understand how households are \nable to develop a sustainable livelihood for themselves, through the use of their \ncapabilities and assets to generate various livelihood strategies (De Satge, 2002). \nBank (2008) explains that the sustainable livelihoods framework investigates how \npeople use their resources to make a living for themselves. He discusses how the \nframework utilises this information to assess how people avoid poverty. Therefore, \nthe livelihoods framework attempts to understand livelihoods, what influences \npoverty, and how best to resolve the issues of those living in vulnerability (Farrington \net al. 2002). The purpose of this approach for this research is to investigate how poor \npeople, through their involvement in Siyakhana, make use of various means to \nreduce household vulnerability.   \nThe DFID Framework is the livelihoods framework that will be used for the current \nresearch because of its emphasis on sustainable livelihoods and it also incorporates \na number of elements that will assist in developing a detailed analysis of people’s \nlivelihoods.  \n \n \n36 \n \n \n \nTherefore, by looking at Figure B above the Livelihoods Framework assesses the \nlivelihoods of people through the following criteria: \n1. Vulnerability context \nThe level of vulnerability among the participants will be investigated through \nassessment of the external risks their households face. For example, examining their \nhousehold composition will help assess how many people contribute to household \nincome or by looking at whether they have experienced loss of income at any point. \nWhat also needs to be investigated is the resilience of the respondents and their \nability to recover from the external risks that they face (Farrington et al. 2002). \nExamining vulnerability of livelihoods is an important feature of the sustainable \nlivelihoods framework. Norton and Foster (2001: 9) note that this stems from the \nbelief that poverty is a consequence of an absence of “secure conditions of life”. \nInvestigating the vulnerability context is important because it provides reasoning as \nto why people adopt certain livelihood strategies. By analysing the vulnerability \nFigure B: DFID Livelihoods Framework. (De Satge, 2002) \n37 \n \ncontext, the research must look at the shocks, trends and seasonalities that affect \nthe livelihoods of the poor (DFID, 1999).  \n2. Livelihood Assets  \nLivelihood assets are important because people are in need of various assets that \nenable them to build their livelihoods. The asset pentagon is a key aspect of the \nlivelihoods framework. These assets are summarised in Table 3 shown below.  \nKrantz (2001) notes that livelihood assets are tangible and intangible and are used to \ndevelop people’s livelihoods and Farrington et al. (1999) mention that assets can be \nsubstituted for one another.     \nHuman capital involves having the education, health or skills that enable a person to \nsustain a livelihood. Human capital can be improved and relies on various livelihood \nstrategies to obtain it. Building human capital involves going to school or ensuring \nthat an individual’s health is taken care of (DFID, 1999). Social capital incorporates \nthose networks and connections people rely on to improve their livelihoods. It can \ninvolve close connections with neighbours or with family members. Many people rely \non relations with their family members as a livelihood strategy for shelter or for \nincome.  \nThe study must therefore develop an understanding of the types of social resources \nhouseholds depend on (DFID, 1999). Natural capital is important because it has a \nstrong link to vulnerability. Natural capital is important for production; however, it may \nalso be the reason people experience shocks and seasonalities (floods or droughts). \nNatural capital is therefore important for the study as urban agriculture relies very \nheavily on natural resources such as land and water.  \nPhysical capital comprises those assets such as basic infrastructure (DFID, 1999). It \nis an important asset because many people relate their levels of poverty to their \ngeneral ability to obtain housing. Physical capital needs to be investigated in terms of \nits quality and whether it is suitable to improve the livelihoods of people. \nFinancial capital can be considered one of the most important assets, especially in \nan urban context. Income plays a significant role in vulnerability and poverty levels of \nindividuals (Krantz, 2001). Therefore, what will need to be investigated in this study \n38 \n \nare the types of financial capitals people hold such as savings, or government \nwelfare and how it impacts on their livelihoods.    \n \nLivelihoods Assets \nDefinition \nHuman  Social  Physical  Financial  Natural  \nIndividuals who \ncan actively \nparticipate in \nincome \ngeneration \nactivities in \norder to build a \nlivelihood \nOr those who \nhave skill and \neducation \ne.g. parents \nThose \nrelationships \nwith other \npeople which \nare used in \nbuilding a \nlivelihood \ne.g. Community \nmembers or \nfamily members \nBasic \ninfrastructure/ \nservices needed \nto sustain a \nlivelihood \ne.g. Transport \nor shelter  \nThe financial \nresources \navailable that \nprovide people \nwith different \nlivelihoods \noptions \ne.g. government \nwelfares or \nwages \nThose \nresources that \nare derived from \nthe earth  \ne.g. Land and \nwater \n \n3. Policies and institutions and Processes \nThe policy and institutional context is important when understanding how people are \nbeing supported in building sustainable livelihoods. Morse et al. (2009) assert that \nthe vulnerability context is greatly influenced by policies and institutions. They \nobserve that while a certain asset might be vulnerable to shocks or seasonality, \nthere may be structure in place to reduce the threat. What will be important about \nthis component is that the research aims to explore the implications of UA for local \ngovernment and urban planning. Therefore, an understanding of possible policy \ninterventions and institutional support for it may make this possible. These structures \ndetermine access to income and livelihood strategies; terms of exchange of the \nvarious forms of assets; and returns that are received when conducting a livelihood \nstrategy (DFID, 1999).  \n4. Livelihood strategies \n Livelihood strategies involve an arrangement of activities that are undertaken by \npeople (Krantz, 2001) and they help to understand how people are able to survive \nwithin vulnerable conditions. Urban agriculture is considered a livelihood strategy. It \nTable 2: Livelihoods assets (Molelu, 2014) \n39 \n \nhas also been argued in previous sections of the report that it is a strategy that is \nundertaken by many poor households as an approach to reduce the risk that comes \nwith lack of income.     \n5. Livelihood Outcomes/Objectives \nKappel et al. (2010:8) note that “livelihood outcomes are the achievements of \npeople’s livelihood strategies”. It is the intention of the study to investigate how the \ngardeners have developed livelihoods for themselves and how they have become \nmore resilient and less vulnerable through urban food gardening. This was done \nthrough the analysis of the various livelihoods assets that they have acquired in \npursuit of the various livelihood outcomes.   \nConclusion \nIn conclusion, the literature review chapter has discussed the various concepts \nrelated to UA and sustainable livelihoods. It found that there is a large amount of \nsupport for the development of UA in cities characterised with increasing vulnerability \namongst its urban residents. The chapter, however, also discusses the criticisms and \narguments of UA and urban planning’s lack of support for the activity.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \n3. Chapter Three: Case Study: Overview \nThe purpose of this chapter is to develop an understanding of the context within \nwhich the case study is located. It expands upon urban poverty and livelihoods and \nelaborates on issues such as vulnerability and deprivation in Johannesburg. It \nindicates the various food gardens located in Johannesburg, including those at \nhousehold, community or public sectors. The research therefore makes use of a \ncase study, the Siyakhana initiative, and discusses how the initiative responds to the \nchallenges of the urban poor in Johannesburg.  \n3.1 Urban poverty in Johannesburg \nAll over the world many cities are facing various developmental challenges and \nJohannesburg experiences many of the same issues. Many of the challenges the \ncity faces are as a result of its ever increasing population. Over the years the city \nattracted migrants from rural areas, as well as people from other countries who are \nin search of better economic opportunities (De Wet et al. 2008). As a result the city \nnow suffers challenges such as urban poverty and inequality. A considerable amount \nof the urban population is poor and unable to participate in the formal urban \neconomy (access to formal housing, services, and employment) which results in \nthem residing on the outskirts of the city (Planact, 2007).      \nJohannesburg is known for being South Africa’s economic heartland, and there is \noften a preconceived notion that the levels of poverty in rural areas are greater than \nin urban areas. However, in areas such as Diepsloot, Orange Farm and Alexandra, \nthe degree of poverty can be considered to be much higher than poverty in some \nrural areas (Beall et al. 2000).  \nThe urban poor are often exposed to issues such as “unemployment, urban violence, \ninsecure housing tenure, a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, chronic disease and food \nsecurity” (De Wet et al. 2008: 4). Trends have indicated that there is a direct link \nbetween unemployment, income and food security. This is no exception for \nJohannesburg. In Johannesburg, income is related to an individual’s ability to \npurchase food (Rudolph et al. 2012). This means, if an individual is unemployed, he \nor she will find it difficult to generate an income, which will in turn affect their ability to \nfeed their families. The inability of people to access formal employment results in \n41 \n \ndeprivation and vulnerability, which leads to food insecurity (Beall et al. 2000). It has \nbeen found that food insecurity has increased sharply in South Africa’s cities, mostly \ndue to rapid increases in global food prices. Food insecurity in the country is \nstanding at approximately 42 percent (COJ, 2012).   \nApproximately 18,5 percent of  Johannesburg’s urban households have no access to \nincome. It is also indicated that in Johannesburg there are almost 700 000 adults \nwho are dependent on others for income while 300 000 people earn less than R800 \nper month (PDG, 2004). Bearing in mind that these figures have increased since \n2004 the figures nevertheless indicate that a considerable amount of people in the \ncity are suffering from income poverty.  \nIn the Johannesburg Poverty and Livelihoods Study (2008) the extent of vulnerability \nwas studied amongst a number of households in different areas of the city. It was \nindicated that many of the causes of vulnerability in the city included the fact that \npoor people in the city are exposed to a range of risks and shocks, such as the death \nof a family member which could mean a loss of income; illness, leading to money \nspent on health needs; as well as increasing prices (De Wet et al. 2008). The study \nalso noted the various effects of household vulnerability on food insecurity in these \nareas and found that due to aspects such as loss of income or illness approximately \n66 percent of the households were considered to be either moderately or severely \nfood insecure (De Wet et al. 2008).  \nLack of access to basic services remains a key issue and contributing factor to urban \npoverty in Johannesburg. Capacity to deliver services in the most crucial areas of the \ncity has become a problem and has led to service delivery protests. In \nJohannesburg, one is able to identify the spatial disparities with the extremely poor \nliving on the urban fringes with almost no basic services while the rich live in areas \nprovided with services. An example is the spatial differences between Alexandra and \nSandton. The figures below indicate the differences in infrastructure and basic \nservices development in these two areas of Johannesburg.  \n42 \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to SA Commercial Prop News (2011) there were a large number of \ndevelopment plans happening for the Sandton business district. It appeared that \napproximately 30 proposals were underway which included new zoning and \nrenovations. One of these new developments included the development of the \nGautrain station to mixed-use developments. The level of attention given to \ntownships such as Alexandra is inequitable and can be clearly understood by the \nabove figures.   \nThere are so many areas with large scale poverty and most of them not being able to \nacquire the necessary services for survival. This contributes to a large economically \nunviable population that burdens the economy of the city. The city has, over the \nyears, attempted to overcome poverty through various policies which aimed to \ntransform the spatially dysfunctional nature of the city. However, at present, there \nare still high poverty levels, which therefore need innovative strategies to alleviate \nthese challenges.   \n3.2 Urban Agricultural Policy in Johannesburg \nThe CoJ currently does not have any specific strategies for urban agriculture, \nalthough, at a national scale there has been policy for food security. Malan (2015) \nnotes that the CoJ has prepared a food security policy that relates to the 2002 \nNational Integrated Food Security Strategy. The City of Johannesburg has recently \nput food insecurity as one of its top ten priorities. Part Seven of the City’s Integrated \nDevelopment Plan (IDP) discusses the City’s priority implementation plans and \nagriculture and food security are noted priorities. The City developed the COJ Food \nFigure B1 (www.flickr.com ) and B2 (www.raysofhope.co.za ) Infrastructure and basic services \ninequality, comparing Sandton and Alexandra \n43 \n \nResilience Framework in 2012 which was to reduce food insecurity by tackling \nindividual hunger through the provision of food vouchers, parcels or backyard \ngardens. The framework supports the informal food sector by providing supplies or \nfarming information. Urban agriculture is supported to a certain extent through \nassistance with requirements like packaging houses and distribution networks.  (CoJ, \n2012). \nAccording to Malan (2015) the City’s Food Resilience Policy encompasses strategies \nfor agriculture. The policy also points out that the Agri-Resource centres allow urban \nfarmers to obtain information on food gardening, access to land or gain help from \nextension officers. The policy also emphasises Food Empowerment Zones where \nlarger farmers are able to access both Agri-Resource centres and the Hub and \nSpoke centres which give access to the Johannesburg Fresh Produce Market. \nHowever, Malan (2015) observes that the policy gives no indication about the \ninstruments for implementation, which could mean that the policy may only apply to \nspecific areas of Johannesburg.      \nThe CoJ has also been able to incorporate urban agriculture into its strategies not \nonly through food security but by covering attributes of it in its larger policy agenda. \nOn a broader scale the City has begun to recognise the importance of concepts such \nas sustainability and resilience in human development in policy development. There \nare important features within the Joburg 2040 Growth and Development Strategy \n(GDS) that relates to urban agriculture. Chapter Two of the Strategy addresses the \nvarious paradigms that will guide the city’s future. The chapter discusses concepts \nsuch as resilience, sustainability and liveability, environment and services and \nhuman and social development (CoJ, 2012) \nIt is important to note that the CoJ has an urban agriculture policy underway and that \nit will follow the multi-stakeholder engagement approach that is seen in the Izindaba \nZokudla project. Malan (2015) states that multi-stakeholder engagement is useful \nbecause it brings about change through giving farmers control over farming systems. \nThis approach is aligned with the IDP which emphasises the need for stakeholder \nengagement and participation. Urban agriculture in Johannesburg will thus be \norganisationally structured in such a way that stakeholders such as the concerned \n44 \n \ncitizens, Farmers Fora and other stakeholders that are involved in garden projects \nengage with one another.           \n3.3 Livelihood strategies of Johannesburg’s urban poor \nJohannesburg’s urban poor population are faced with a number of shocks and risks \nthat determine the range of survival strategies they employ. Loss of income or \nemployment, for example, will require a household to adopt various livelihood \nstrategies that assist them in becoming less vulnerable. The urban poor adopt a \nnumber of formal or informal ways of making a living which include activities such as \ndriving or domestic work (cleaning homes) or they set up their might decide to set \ntheir own child care or street trading businesses (PDG, 2004).  \nInformal trading is one of the most recognised ways in which the urban poor \ngenerate income for their households. There are traders located along various \nstreets such as Eloff Street, Kerk Street, and Noord Street.  \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure C: Informal trading along Noord Street. Maduna, L and Daeepp, M \n(2013) www.goethe.de/  \n \n45 \n \nOther ways in which the urban poor generate a livelihood for themselves is through \ngovernment welfare grants, such as pensions or child support (PDG, 2004). For \nmany of the poor these grants may represent a significant share of their monthly \nhousehold income. In extreme cases, some even rely exclusively on government \ngrants to survive hunger and to be able to afford food for their households. Many \nurban poor households have adopted multiple livelihood strategies where they would \ncombine both formal and informal activities. For example, households in Alexandra, \nOrange Farm, or Diepsloot receive formal grants from the government while also \nensuring they have financial support and assistance from family members and \nneighbours (De Wet et al. 2008).  \nMany people in Johannesburg have also made the decision to reside closer to the \ncity centre or employment. This is another form of livelihood strategy that is adopted \nby many urban households, because they are able to reduce transport costs and \nthus save on income. However, urban areas of Johannesburg are characterised by \nhigh rental prices which defeats the purpose of saving on transport costs (PDG, \n2004). Therefore, many urban residents have responded by residing informally on \nthe periphery of the city, thus acquiring little or no transport and rental costs. \nAn important livelihood strategy of the urban poor is the development of urban \nagriculture in Johannesburg. There are a range of urban agriculture activities taking \nplace (subsistence farming strategies) in Johannesburg, which are at various levels. \nThese include the household, community, public sector, as well as NGO and CBO \nlevels. Like many other livelihood strategies in Johannesburg, subsistence farming \nactivities in urban areas are a response to vulnerability and deprivation and are \neither the direct response of households or are developed out of the support of \ndifferent organisations.  \nAs noted earlier, urban food production takes place in suburbs such as Soweto, \nwhere the Izindaba Zokudla projects are located. The project is aimed at sustainable \nfood production and is closely linked to the development of the urban agriculture \npolicy being implemented by the CoJ. Other projects include the Bambanani Food \nand Herb Garden in Bertram’s. The project was acknowledged for its commitment to \nnatural resources management and won an award from the Gauteng Department of \nAgriculture and Rural Development. One of the volunteers at the food garden \n46 \n \nboasted that they grow kale and that it costs approximately R30 at a supermarket, \nwhile at the food garden it is half that price (Sulaiman, 2013). \nAccording to Richards and Taylor (2012), in Orange Farm, there exists a wide variety \nof urban agricultural activities. They provided a list of the different types which \nincluded: \n- Homestead and supplementary homestead gardens located in the backyards \nof RDP houses \n- School yard gardens \n- Project gardens in crèches and day-care centres \n- Community gardens where the land is farmed in order to produce food or \nincome for those members of the garden.  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnyango (2010) notes in his study on urban and peri-urban agriculture in Orange \nFarm the various reasons why many of the people participate in urban farming. He \nfound that the need for food was the biggest reason why many of the residents grew \nfood, with 78 respondents out of 100 who said it was their main reason. Following \nthis was the fact food was expensive, some of them were unemployed and others \nneeded income.   \nFigure D: School yard project at \nLangalibalele Dube Primary \nSchool.

Adapted from \nRichards and Taylor (2012) \n47 \n \n3.4 The Siyakhana Initiative \n3.4.1 Introduction of the Siyakhana Initiative \nThe Siyakhana Initiative was an urban food programme that started out of an idea to \nfeed inner city food insecure children and people who live with HIV (Nicolle, 2011). \nThe idea to create an initiative to feed food insecure children came out of a process \nestablished by the Director and Founder of the Siyakhana Initiative when he created \na unit called the Health Promotion Unit. Within this process medical, dental, nursing \nand pharmaceutical students were taken to conduct various projects and \nassignments. In conducting these projects the students realised that food insecurity \nwas a major problem in the inner city. The Director stated that “when we would \nrecommend people to promote their health with physical activity or better eating, the \nresponses were always that what you are recommending is either not available or it \nis not accessible or not affordable” (Director, 2015).  \n \nWhen the students realised that something needed to be done about food insecurity \nin the inner city, they collaborated with various organisations such as the Early \nChildhood Development Centres (ECDCs) and other NGOs that provide homecare \nfor people living with HIV. They then came up with the idea of creating a food garden \nto feed inner city children. The City of Johannesburg assisted them in locating an \nappropriate location to start the food garden, which was Bezuidenhout Park in Bez \nValley just outside the city centre. The Siyakhana urban food garden commenced in \n2005, joining forces with organisations such as Food and Trees for Africa, Cape \nGate, Urban Greening Fund, and others (Nicolle, 2011). \n \nIn their annual report of 2009, the objective of the food garden was to “Establish a \nmodel permaculture food garden system for food production, education, research \nand empowerment of the community (particularly women) through training, \nemployment and income generating opportunities” (Siyakhana, 2009: 5). The \ninitiative has evolved since then and encompasses a range of other objectives. \nAccording to the Annual Siyakhana Report of 2011 the initiative included elements \nsuch as sustainably produced food, stimulating social change, financial sustainability \nand economic sustainability (Siyakhana, 2011). Sustainable food production and \necological health promotion is a focal point for the initiative and its efforts have been \n48 \n \nestablished within principles of the Primary Health Care Approach and the Ottawa \nCharter for Health Promotion, through which they are able to team up with various \ninstitutions and departments to work towards the social, economic and \nenvironmental aspects of livelihoods (Siyakhana, 2011).  \nThe Siyakhana food garden has been the subject for research of a number of topics \nover the years. These topics range from food security and nutrition through to food \ngardening as an ecological practice. Research includes work done by Wilfred \nBengnwi who studied Sustainable Urban Livelihood Challenges – A case for urban \nagro-ecology in Johannesburg (2010) and a dissertation by Trixie-Belle Nicolle, \nwhose focus was on The Role of urban food gardens in creating an enabling \nenvironment for empowerment (2012). \n  \n3.4.2 Siyakhana’s stakeholders \n \nThe Siyakhana stakeholders include those who were involved in the establishment of \nthe food garden, the organisations and departments, as well as the gardeners; these \nincluded key stakeholders within the initiative such as various NGOs and the ECDCs \nwhich assisted with the garden. As the food garden developed, it required the \nnecessary infrastructure in order for it to be maintained. As such, a pond was \nconstructed, and was used for rain water harvesting. Fencing around the garden was \nalso needed to ensure safety within the garden. Thus, various Wits University \ndepartments supported the initiative with technical and expert assistance in order to \nrealise these infrastructural requirements (Nicolle, 2011). \n \nThe Siyakhana staff members are some of the most important stakeholders within \nthe food garden. The project director and is the founder of the Siyakhana Initiative is \nresponsible for managing the garden and is teamed with the programme head of the \ninitiative. The programme head is mainly concerned with research and consulting \n(Nicolle, 2011). The programme head has attended a conference in Holland on \nMetropolitan Agriculture where he discovered new connections with people for \ntraining, and the use of innovative technologies and has also researched food \nsecurity and nutrition (Siyakhana, 2011).            \n \n49 \n \nIn 2008, there were fifteen people working at the garden (Nicolle, 2011), currently \nthere are only seven employed gardeners and one new gardener who is not \npermanent. According to the Director of Siyakhana, one of the reasons is that the \nworkers find other opportunities after they have gained experience from the food \ngarden. The gardeners are considered as staff members in the food garden and \nthose managing the garden have always tried to create an environment where the \ngardeners feel as though they are working under formal working conditions. They are \ngiven uniforms and boots, they have regular wages paid to them, and they are able \nto take leave. However, they do not have formal contracts; but, they will be given \nthese in the near future. One the oldest gardeners began at Siyakhana as a \nvolunteer but soon learnt how to farm. He is now considered permanent staff and is \ngiven an income.   \n  \n3.4.3 Sustainable farming practices  \nA large part of what is interesting about Siyakhana is its environmentally conscious \ngardening practices. The supervisor, who can be considered as one of the gardeners \nand is involved in the overall management of the garden, noted some of the \ninnovations they utilised in running the garden and some interesting eco-friendly \nmechanisms that had been made use of.  \n  \n50 \n \n  \n \n \nThese are some of the buildings that are being utilised to run the garden. They have \neven made their own toilet system that is used by the gardeners. They have also \ncreated a building that was made out of broom sticks. Other innovations that they \nhave adopted are the use of earthworms in which they are used to make compost for \nthe food garden. The supervisor said that “what they produce are so valuable to \nfarmers as sources of nutrients and compost, as well as a source of healthy \nbacteria.”  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure I: Earthworm compost. Photo: \nVan Niekerk (2015) \nFigures G and H: Innovative toilet system (right). \nPhotos by Van Niekerk \nFigures F1 and F2: The Siyakhana field office which is made of entirely natural \nmaterials and eco-friendly structure made out of broom sticks (right). Photos by Van \nNiekerk (2015) \n51 \n \nIt was also found that the food garden utilised materials and resources that could be \nfound on site, which meant that less external resources were required. He also \nindicated that since they do not have any electricity coming into the garden they had \nto develop a battery-operated sprinkler system. The sprinkler system would operate \non a battery-powered timer and therefore it would not be necessary for any of the \ngardeners to constantly get up to turn the water on. \n Conclusion \nThis chapter commenced with a discussion on urban poverty in Johannesburg. It \nwas found that much like other cities of the developing world, Johannesburg faces \nmajor issues with food insecurity, poverty and unemployment. The chapter also \ndiscussed urban agricultural policy in Johannesburg and found that the City has \nindicated a start in support for urban agriculture through its food resilience framework \nand its imminent urban agricultural policy. In addition, the various livelihoods \nstrategies that the city’s urban poor undertake have been examined as well as the \nother examples of urban agriculture elsewhere in Johannesburg.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n52 \n \n4 Chapter Four: Presentation of Findings \nThe purpose of this chapter is to discuss the findings obtained from the interviews \nundertaken with Siyakhana gardeners, staff members and a CoJ official. The aim of \nthe chapter is to highlight the perspectives of the gardeners and how direct \ninvolvement in the food garden has impacted upon their livelihoods. The chapter also \noutlines the views of staff members which look at the overall performance of the \ngarden, and how it has affected their future plans and prospects. \nOverall, only one staff member was interviewed, who was the Director of the \nSiyakhana Initiative. Although, other staff members were not interviewed, the \nDirector’s contribution was nevertheless essential to the study. Eight gardeners and \none volunteer gardener were interviewed. A volunteer gardener, who is responsible \nfor operating the food garden, made an important contribution to the research as he \nworked with the gardeners on a daily basis. He cannot be considered to be a \nbeneficiary of the food garden as he is largely involved in the operational aspects of \nthe garden. Throughout the report, he will be referred to as the garden supervisor. A \nCoJ official was interviewed to gain his views on possible and current plans for urban \nagriculture in Johannesburg. His perspectives are important to the research from a \npolicy perspective, given that he is considerably involved in the Joburg 2040 Growth \nand Development Strategy. \n4.1 Overview of Respondents  \n4.1.1 The Gardeners \nThe overall number of interviews conducted in the investigation was eight. Six of the \ngardeners interviewed were male, while only two were female.  All of the gardeners \nconsidered themselves to be formal employees of the Siyakhana urban food garden. \nAccording to the gardeners, they worked from 7:30 in the morning until 15:00 in the \nafternoon, five days a week. A few of the gardeners indicated that they often work on \nSaturdays as well.  \nMost of the gardeners are not from Johannesburg and were born elsewhere. Two of \nthe gardeners are Zimbabweans, but stay in Johannesburg because they work here. \nOther gardeners come from places such as KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and the North \n53 \n \nWest. Three gardeners are married and are between the ages of forty and fifty. Most \nof the gardeners are young, and are below the age 36. The youngest gardener is 21 \nyears old and is a resident at the park.  \nIn gaining an understanding as to the background of the initiative and finding out the \nfuture prospects it was important to interview those involved in the management of \nthe food garden.  Therefore the Director and Founder of the Siyakhana Initiative was \ninterviewed, as he is involved in the overall operations of the Siyakhana. One of his \nbiggest roles is ensuring funding for the sustainability of the initiative through \nresearch and making networks with various organisations. The Director is not hired \nby the University of Witwatersrand to run the Siyakhana initiative. All his efforts are \ndone voluntarily as he does not profit from the funding raised by the initiative.  \nIn addition to the gardeners and founder of the initiative, the study conducted an \ninterview with a CoJ official. The interview conducted with the Deputy Director of \nStrategy and Research at the CoJ, is largely involved in reviewing the Joburg 2040 \nGrowth and Development Strategy, and the development and implementation of \npolicy at the City. Therefore the CoJ official’s opinion on urban agriculture was \nimportant because he holds an understanding of the City’s strategic future and it was \nimportant to explore whether the City has any current plans or support for urban \nagriculture.  \n \n4.2 Vulnerability: Factors affecting the Gardeners \nUnderstanding the vulnerability context of the gardeners is important because it \nhelps grasp why they engage in certain livelihood strategies. The livelihood \nstrategies of the gardeners are influenced by external forces such as food price \nhikes and lack of production during certain seasons. Therefore this section of the \nchapter observes some of these factors.   \n4.2.1 Effect of seasonal production on gardeners \nAgriculture is affected by lack of production during certain seasons such as winter. \nWinter is often cold and dry and not much produce grows during this time. During \n54 \n \ninvestigation of the Siyakhana garden, there was an opportunity to witness the \ndifference in the growth of the produce during winter as opposed to spring time.  \n    \n  \n \nThe two figures above indicate the difference in the amount of vegetables that are \ngrown during the different seasons. This can have a negative impact on the poor \nbecause they are not growing as much produce for their households and this may \nlead to higher food insecurity levels. However, the conditions at Siyakhana are \ndifferent because the gardeners are not heavily reliant on the food gardens to feed \ntheir families every day. They are provided with an income that they use to feed their \nhouseholds. \nA large part of the benefit of subsistence farming for poor urban households is that \nthe produce obtained from it allows families to protect themselves against severe \nhunger and poverty. For the gardeners at the Siyakhana food garden, the benefits \nare gained through receiving income. It was noted by the supervisor that Siyakhana \ndid not rely heavily on its produce to derive an income to pay the gardeners. Rather, \nit relies on donor funding to be able to give the gardeners salaries. Therefore, the \ngardeners’ ability to avoid vulnerability from seasonal factors is due to the fact that \nthey are not only reliant on the produce.     \n4.3 Livelihoods Assets and Strategies of the Gardeners \nThe livelihood assets and strategies are an important part of the findings for the \nreport. It indicates the various struggles the gardeners face and illustrates how they \nare able to make use of different methods to maintain their households and alleviate \nvulnerability.  \nFigures J1 and J2: Indicating the difference in the food garden early August and mid \nOctober. Photos Van Niekerk (2015) \n55 \n \n4.3.1 Household income \nHousehold income is a very important asset for the gardeners and represents their \nfinancial capital. Observing where the gardeners derive their income is important in \nunderstanding the types of livelihoods strategies they have had to employ.  \nOf all the gardeners that were interviewed, many indicated that on the earnings from \nthe food gardens most of them were supporting between two and five family \nmembers. It was only two of the gardeners who said that there was another family \nmember bringing in an additional income for the family. The one member said that \nhis brother helped support the family and the other indicated that his mother was \nalso working to support the family. However, most of the gardeners said that they \nwere the only member of the family who was supporting the household. \nUpon interviewing the gardeners, they were asked if they believed that the food \ngardens provided enough income for their households. Six of the seven gardeners \ninterviewed indicated that they felt that the income that they received from the food \ngardens was enough to support their household. Although they felt that it was \nbringing in enough income, one of the gardeners pointed out that she enjoys \ngardening but wishes she could do something that brought in even more income for \nher family. However, one of the gardeners who had been working at the gardens for \nonly three months felt that it was not enough for his family.  \nWhen asked whether they had any additional means of income, six of the permanent \ngardeners said that the food garden was the only source of income. One of the \nyounger gardeners who had been working there for almost three years said that he \ndoes do some work on weekends. He said that “I am an artist, I do pop/rap on \nweekends and so I perform. If I go on weekends, I sometimes get paid…they give a \nlittle bit extra, you know” (Gardener One, August, 2015).  \nOn a short follow-up interview with the gardeners a while after the initial interview a \nquestion was posed to them whether they had access to any social grants. All but \none of the gardeners had a social grant. They were asked why they did not have a \nsocial grant and two of the respondents indicated that they were Zimbabwean, which \nmay be standing in the way of a social grant. Other gardeners pointed out that they \nhad issues with gaining social grants because he/she did not have the necessary \n56 \n \ndocuments. It was noted during the interview that most of the gardeners who said \nthat they did not have a social grant were not pensioners and had adult children. The \none gardener said he had access to social grants and he has three young children \nwho all still attend school. Social grants can be an important extra form of income for \nfamilies because the gardener who indicated that he makes use of social grants also \nindicated that he has not experienced difficulties with being able to feed his family. \n4.3.2 Perceived food security levels  \nThe gardeners were asked whether they thought that they had any problems with \nfeeding their families. None of the gardeners indicated that they had any severe food \ninsecurity issues in their households. However, they did indicate that they would \nstruggle now and then, but not often. They also indicated during the research that \nthe food garden was helping, such as when they are given some of the produce to \ntake home to their families, once or twice a week. It was also noted during the \ninterviews that many of the gardeners indicated that they did struggle with \npurchasing food for their households before they started working at Siyakhana. \nAbout six of the gardeners who were interviewed observed that since joining the \ninitiative, the health of their families has improved because they have access to fruits \nand vegetables on a weekly basis and that the income generated assists with this as \nwell. \n4.3.3 Previous employment of gardeners \nThe livelihood strategies of the gardeners before they began working at the \nSiyakhana food garden is important because it helps examine the reasons why the \ngardeners started working at Siyakhana where they might have felt that they had no \nother means to support their families. Employment is also important because in \ncertain ways it helps people have access to various assets such as physical capital \nor financial capital.  \nThe gardeners were asked if they had any employment before they started working \nat the food gardens. About five of the gardeners indicated that they had other \nemployment before they worked at the food gardens. One of the gardeners said that \nhe has had employment in packaging chicken. When asked why he was not working \nthere anymore he replied by saying: “because if you go there during the week, you \n57 \n \nstand in front of the gate and they choose. So if you end up not getting chosen, you \nwon’t get paid” (Gardener Two, August, 2015). When he was asked whether it was \ndifficult to find employment before the food garden he said: “It was very hard. I was \nwith my friend for almost two and half month, going out there struggling. So it was a \nrelief when I started at the garden” (Gardener Two, August, 2015).  \nAnother of the gardeners said he did not leave by choice but that the company he \nworked for retrenched him. One of the gardeners also indicated that he was self-\nemployed and painted houses for people. When asked if it brought in enough income \nfor his family he said that it was because he was able to charge his customers his \nown rates. However, it was not indicated as to the reasons why he left.  \nThe gardeners who indicated that they were not employed before they started \nworking at the garden were the younger employees. They began working at the \ngarden immediately after they either finished high school or dropped out. One of the \nrecent gardeners said he came to work at the garden as soon as he finished matric. \n4.3.4 Levels of education of gardeners \nHuman capital is a very important aspect in the livelihoods of individuals because it \noften determines what livelihood strategies a person is able to employ. Therefore the \ngardeners were interviewed about their highest levels of education. The results of \nthis were that only one of the gardeners was able to complete his matric. When one \nof the female gardeners was asked why she dropped out of school she indicated that \nit was because she had fallen pregnant.  \nThe gardener who indicated that he was able to finish his last year of high school \npointed out that he was now able to enrol at a college to study marketing \nmanagement. This is an indication that human capital such as education plays a \nlarge role in the capabilities of poor individuals. The fact that many of the gardeners \ndid not complete their high school education may have been a factor contributing to \ntheir previous struggles with finding appropriate employment to provide for their \nhouseholds. Evidently, the food garden has presented them with an opportunity to \ndevelop their human capital and to avoid exposure to the consequences of \nunemployment.  \n \n58 \n \n4.3.5 Learning and training opportunities \nSiyakhana is known for training its members, so it was important to the investigation \nto find out how the gardeners experienced the food garden and how they benefited. \nThe gardeners were asked whether they had any farming experience before working \nat Siyakhana. All of the gardeners indicated that they learnt everything about farming \nwith fruits and vegetables through working at the food garden. \n  \n  \n \nMany of the gardeners indicated that they enjoyed working at the gardens because \nthey felt that it was a good opportunity for them and they learnt many skills by \nworking there. One of the gardeners said that he is proud to work at the food garden \nbecause he has learnt a lot. He also said that he wishes to apply what he has learnt \nelsewhere one day, such as starting his own garden. Another gardener said that \n“now I am doing it because I enjoy it and it helps me with a lot of things. First it \ntaught me that you don’t have to work for big companies to make money…you can \ndo things on your own, just using the ground” (Gardener Two, August, 2015). \nAnother gardener indicated that he has already started his own garden. When asked \nwhat kind of produce he grows he said vegetables and herbs. He replied with: “I am \na doctor now”, indicating that he can now use the herbs he grows to heal his family, \nrather than having to spend money on expensive medicines (Gardener Three, \nAugust, 2015). A beginner at the food garden indicated during the interview that \nwhen he started working at the food garden he did not enjoy it, but he is not starting \nto enjoy it. He stated that: “My mother forced me. I didn’t want to come and work \nhere, but now I am enjoying it because when I came here I started doing work like \nFigures K1 and K2: Mushroom house (left) and cabbages (right) Photos Van Niekerk (2015) \n59 \n \nanyone, with the weeding. But now I am working with the irrigation” (Gardener Four, \nOctober, 2015).   \nSeemingly, the Siyakhana food garden has created a platform for the gardeners to \ndevelop their human capital. Therefore, despite having very little education, the \ngardeners are given the opportunity to progress by becoming skilled in farming \npractices. \n4.3.6 Accommodation of Gardeners   \nPhysical capital is important because basic infrastructure plays an important role in \nimproving livelihoods. In addition, it is important to understand the conditions the \ngardeners live under and the type of housing they have access to or have acquired \nfor themselves. It also represents an added livelihood strategy they have employed.  \nThe gardeners were questioned whether they owned their own homes or rented \nproperty somewhere. Most of the gardeners responded by saying that they did not \nhave their own property. However, two gardeners did indicate that they rented \nproperty. One gardener said that he rented in Yeoville. Another gardener indicated \nthat he has his own house because he inherited it when his mother passed away, \nand he shares the property with his brother. However, he indicated that he does not \nlive in the property. He only stays on the property when he travels back to Durban \nduring December. He and many other gardeners stay at the park for work.  \nThe living arrangements at the park represent a livelihood strategy because most of \nthe gardeners are staying there. It was indicated by the gardeners that they do not \nhave to pay any rental costs by staying on the park property. This offers the \ngardeners an opportunity to save on their income which would mean that they are \nable to spend money on other things. It was also specified that there are about nine \npeople staying in one house which has to be sectioned off between households. The \ngardeners were asked how they felt about the crowded conditions they were living \nunder and they responded by saying that it was uncomfortable and often created \nconflict between people. One gardener said that, “You can’t stay quietly, because \none day you might have a misunderstanding with someone because you don’t want \nto listen” (Gardener Five, October, 2015).  \n60 \n \nNevertheless, despite the conflict that occurs between people, the gardeners \ncontinue to stay on the property. For many of the gardeners it might be that they \nhave no other choice, especially when they are not able to afford staying elsewhere. \nThe gardeners are also able to cut costs that they may have incurred if they had to \ntravel daily to get to work. Siyakhana is currently in process of renting the property \non the park so that the gardeners have a more secure form of shelter. The food \ngarden in this sense has provided the gardeners with physical capital so that they do \nnot have to worry about finding accommodation somewhere else.   \n4.4 Institutional and structural factors \n4.4.1 Institutional and financial arrangement \nAccording to the Director, some of the first forms of institutional support that were \ngained when they started the food gardens were when they collaborated with the \nEarly Childhood Development Centres (ECDC) and the NGOs that provided shelters \nand home-care for HIV patients. They approached the City of Johannesburg and \nthey were involved in a mapping exercise in which they were to identify all the \nsuitable areas that were in close proximity to the inner city. They were able to start \nthe project because of their relationships with these organisations and government \ndepartments.  \nIn terms of the financial arrangement and funding within the food garden, the \nDirector was asked whether he personally profited from the gardens and how funds \nwere gained and allocated within the Initiative. He indicated that he did not profit at \nall from the food gardens and that if anything the food garden was costing him \nmoney. He emphasised that Siyakhana was more than just a food garden and that it \ninvolved research, consultation, training and teaching, and allocation and gaining of \nfunds depended upon this. He said, “For example, we got funding from the United \nNations (UN) to develop this online course on food security; to develop partnerships \nwith southern African universities such as Alongwe University of Agriculture and \nNatural Resources and the University of Namibia and two European universities” \n(Director, August 2015). He therefore emphasised that most of the funding comes \nfrom these organisations that they liaise with or do research for and very little comes \nfrom the food garden. Another example he used was: “that applies to work we did for \n61 \n \nWesBank and FirstRand, where they asked us to do research related to their \nprojects they are funding. And again we send them a proposal and a budget” \n(Director, August, 2015). In other words, the financial viability of the organisation is \nextremely dependent on the continued existence of these partnerships and \nnetworks. He indicated that he is not employed by Wits but runs a unit within Wits \nand that all their funding is generated through consultation and research or even \ncontracts with the UN which provides the funding occasionally.  \n4.4.2 Role of the City and Urban Planning \nUpon interviewing both the Director and supervisor at Siyakhana, they were asked \nwhether they thought that the food garden received adequate support from the City. \nThey both recognise that the City is attempting to help initiatives such as Siyakhana \nbut they believed that it is still not enough. The supervisor asserted that, “I think that \nthere is definitely a start of support. I mean, they implemented the Agri-Resource \ncentres, not that I can say that they are being managed effectively, but at least it’s a \nstart” (August, 2015). He noted that in the past, different departments had tried to \nreach out through community forums and workshops, and that there was the effort, \nhowever, they still have a long way to go and much more effort is needed. He \nexpressed the need for support on training and funding. \nThe Director, however, expressed a deeper concern for the lack of support from the \nCity. He believes “that there is much more that can be done to facilitate initiatives like \nSiyakhana” (August, 2015). He spoke about the resistance towards the food garden \nand gave an example of how he had invited the Vice Chancellor (who is not the \ncurrent one) to visit the garden to see what the university was involved in and the \nVice Chancellor expressed embarrassment because it did not  follow the image that \nthe university was trying to portray. But he believes that the resistance towards \nurban agriculture is a part of a process. He relates it back to the time there was \nresistance towards the concept of primary health care and that eventually became a \nformal policy. Therefore, he believes that in time there will be acceptance and formal \nsupport for projects like Siyakhana. Ultimately, what those involved in the food \ngarden believe is that there is some form of recognition of urban agriculture, but what \nneeds to be done now is to translate it into action i.e. doing projects or setting up \nmodels that can be replicated to the people (Director, August, 2015).  \n62 \n \nThe CoJ official, however, asserted that claims that the CoJ was not doing enough to \nsupport urban agriculture was “complete nonsense”. He said that “the view that the \ncity is not doing enough…unfortunately we will defend that very much because we \ndon’t agree” (August, 2015). The CoJ official stated that he did not understand why \nthe city is being criticised for not doing enough when there are strategies put in place \nin support for things such as food security. In the interview he explained that the \nJoburg 2040 GDS was addressing many of the concepts that are linked to support \nfor urban agriculture. Chapter Two of the GDS discusses the paradigms of the city \n(resilience, sustainability, liveability; human and social development; environment \nand services; etc.). He notes that the strategies are connected. For example, food \nsecurity is linked to sustainability, to the green economy, and to resources in the \ninner city. He also noted the food security strategy within the CoJ IDP. Evidently, the \ncity also has an urban food agriculture policy underway. This was his response when \nasked about what the city was doing to develop the idea of sustainability and \nresilience thinking.  \nThe CoJ official’s point was very important, considering that the research aims to \nunderstand the policies and processes that are in place that support urban \nagriculture. However, the purpose was to find out what the city has implemented so \nfar, that have reflected those concepts within the GDS. Nevertheless, it was \ninteresting for the research to note that the City is focused on concepts that are \nparticularly valuable to urban agriculture.  \nFood security is highlighted as a priority for the City, thus it has become a strategy, \nand it recognises the importance of urban agriculture in creating food security. It \nappeared that the City seemed to associate urban agriculture with food security and \nthat food security would be how they show their support for urban agriculture \nactivities. It is correct, because food security plays a huge role in urban food \nproduction, however, if urban food gardens are going to be sustainable, the City \nmight need to show support in terms of other aspects within urban agriculture such \nas training and marketing.   \n \n \n63 \n \nConclusion \nThis chapter presented a thorough understanding of the findings gained from the \ninterview process. It presented the findings according to the Livelihoods Framework \noutlined in the literature review chapter and gained a useful understanding of the \nvarious factors that affect the livelihoods of the gardeners. The chapter discussed \nthe importance of factors such as assets and strategies in understanding how the \ngardeners have been able to benefit from the initiative. In addition the chapter helped \nreveal the most important findings that will be discussed in the following chapters.        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n64 \n \n5 Chapter Five: Analysis of Findings \nWith regards to the presentation of findings discussed in the preceding chapter, this \nchapter discusses what the findings mean in relation to the context and literature \noutlined in the previous chapters of the report. The findings point to the number of \nissues for people involved in urban food gardens. The findings also indicate the \nreasons why people are involved in urban food gardens and how it has improved \ntheir livelihoods. It develops a positive motivation for the Siyakhana Initiative, as one \nis able to extrapolate from the findings the livelihood assets that have been derived \nwhen being involved in the food garden. The findings also discuss the structures and \nprocesses that are in place to support urban food gardens as well as the need for \nimproved support from local government.  \nThe analysis of the findings is structured into two main sections where it firstly \ndiscusses how the livelihoods of the gardeners have been affected by their \ninvolvement in the Siyakhana Initiative. This section analyses the various livelihoods \nassets and strategies they now may have access to and considers them in terms of \nthe themes addressed in the literature review. The chapter then outlines the support \nthat is being provided to the gardeners and the food garden, as well as considering \nadditional support needed for the garden to facilitate resilience and create \nsustainable livelihoods. \n5.1 Siyakhana’s impact on the livelihoods of the gardeners \nIn the preceding chapters of the report it has been indicated that due to various \nsocio-economic issues facing cities, people have been forced to adopt survival \ntactics to protect themselves against vulnerability. Aspects such as lack of income or \nlow levels of education can seriously hinder an individual’s ability acquire what is \nneeded to achieve a full life and Masik (1997) notes that deprivation of urban \nresidents can occur when there is low income within households. Vulnerability and \ndeprivation have led households to adapt to their environment by adopting various \nlivelihoods strategies as a response as noted by Moser (1998).  \nUrban Agriculture can be considered a survival strategy practiced by poor \nhouseholds to improve their livelihoods. Earlier sections in the report have \nmentioned positive arguments for the activity pertaining to its ability to provide food \n65 \n \nsecurity and income generation. However, opponents have emphasised caution \nconcerning the activity in terms of lack of proof and giving it too much credit with \nregards to poverty alleviation. This chapter therefore observes the impact Siyakhana \nhas had on the livelihoods of the gardeners and whether it potentially creates \nsustainable livelihoods.           \n5.1.1 Saving money and generating income \nGenerating income and saving on money is an important feature in improving the \nlivelihoods and reducing vulnerability of the urban poor. It was mentioned elsewhere \nin the report that income plays an important role in the lives of urban residents \nbecause of the high living costs of urban areas. The Global Food Security Index \n(2014) notes this by stating that the costs of living in urban areas is significantly \nhigher than in rural areas and due to the lack of economic opportunities in sub-\nSaharan Africa (SSA) it is much more difficult to escape poverty. Therefore, an \nimportant part of the report has been investigating the income situation of the \ngardeners.    \nChapter Four of the report discussed that the food garden helped to promote income \ngeneration and savings. In section 4.3.1 of the findings chapter, six out of the seven \ngardeners who were asked whether they felt that the garden helped them earn \nenough income for their households, indicated that it did provide them with enough \nincome.  This relates back to the literature explored on urban agriculture and its \nbenefits for those living in vulnerability. Urban food production represents a way for \npoor households to generate income for their families and it is pointed out by \nRichards and Taylor (2012) that millions of people make use of urban agricultural \nactivities to generate income for their families. As such, participation in the urban \nfood garden has improved the financial capital of the gardeners, which is important \nbecause, Farrington et al. (2002) note that income is often one of the most essential \nassets needed for survival, especially in an urban context where various household \nneeds have to be purchased.  \nIt is, however, important to note that the income generated from working at \nSiyakhana is not derived from the food garden itself. It was not indicated throughout \nthe interviewing process that Siyakhana relied on the produce to receive an income. \nTherefore, even though it was indicated in the literature review chapter of the report, \n66 \n \nit is essential to mention that the benefit that was obtained by the gardeners \nthemselves was not a benefit from the urban agricultural activity itself but a benefit of \nthe initiative being able to secure donor funding to pay the gardeners. \nThis underlines an important critique of the initiative in the sense that there is a lack \nof a business model. It was indicated in the literature review that urban agriculture \nnow encompasses more than growing food to feed the household. It was noted by \nNgcamphalala (2013) that urban agriculture covers processing, marketing and \ntrading. It is important, especially in ensuring the sustainability of a project such as \nSiyakhana that it considers other ways of bringing in an income. Relying on donor \nfunding is unsustainable because, they are not receiving income that they are able to \ndepend upon on a constant basis. At a certain point, those managing Siyakhana may \nnot be able to secure funding for the garden from willing organisations. It was \nalready indicated during the interview with the Director of Siyakhana that it was \nbecoming harder to obtain funding for the food garden. However, it was indicated in \nthe findings of the report that Siyakhana is in the process of establishing an \noperations plan, but it was not revealed as to the details of this plan.  \nIt was noted in the report that urban agriculture tends to take a social and \nenvironmental focus. It is important however, particularly if urban agriculture is going \nto be considered sustainable, that it takes into account possible economic \nimplications of the activity. The FAO (2007: 28) notes the economic impacts of urban \nagriculture at households level and observes that it can involve aspects such as \n“self-employment, income from processing, sales of surpluses, savings on food and \nhealth expenditures, exchange of agricultural products for other economic goods”. \nTherefore, it is possible for urban agriculture to engage a wide range of income \ngenerating activities. However, it must be understood that implementation of the \nactivities might require support from various stakeholders. \n \nThe lack of a business model and the fact that the gardeners do not benefit from the \nproduce means there might be a need for support in order to help improve overall \noperations in the food garden. Being self-sustainable as a project is important \nbecause in order for the gardeners to feel secure in their ability to receive income on \na regular basis, needs there to be a firm plan in place on how Siyakhana will \ngenerate income as a food garden.   \n67 \n \nIt was indicated earlier that the Siyakhana Initiative gave the gardeners an \nopportunity to save on income by giving them access to certain assets. In section \n4.3.6, the findings indicated that the gardeners had access to free accommodation \non the park premises. Owing to the free accommodation they received they are able \nto save income that would have otherwise been used on rent or other housing. It was \nnoted in the findings that due to arrangements made between Siyakhana and the \nowners of the property, the gardeners were able to share the property with one \nanother. However, there are more formal arrangements being put in place, where \nSiyakhana is able to formally lease the property. Having access to physical capital is \nimportant for people because often many people relate being poor to the inability to \nobtain housing.            \n5.1.2 Improved food security and nutrition \nFood security and nutrition were issues that were explored in the literature review \nchapter. Van der Merwe (2011) gave a definition of food security that does not only \nconsider having access to food alone, but that food security means having access to \nnutritious food for healthy living. Urban agriculture has been linked to food security \nand nutrition because it is able to improve the livelihoods of poor households, as \nnoted by Battersby (2010).  \nPositive links between urban agriculture and food security were found in the \nliterature review chapter and was therefore an important issue that was explored in \nthe findings of the investigation. It is important to understand whether the food \ngarden has provided for the gardeners in such a way that they are able to receive \nfood from the garden or purchase their own food through income derived from the \nproduced \nIn section 4.2.2, the gardeners were interviewed concerning the difficulty in feeding \ntheir families. Most of the gardeners noted that before they started working at the \nfood garden they struggled to feed their families, but since they joined Siyakhana \ntheir ability to provide food has improved. They indicated that this was particularly \ndue the fact that they were either unemployed or struggling to find employment that \nwould generate enough income. It was also found that because Siyakhana supplies \nthem with some of the produce from the food garden on a weekly basis, it helps \nthem with feeding their households. \n68 \n \nIt was indicated in section 4.3.4 of the findings that many of the gardeners were not \nable to finish school, which may have contributed to their inability to find \nemployment. It was noted by Amar-Klemesu (2000) that food security is affected by \nthree issues and one of them is employment and cash income. It is observed that \ndue to lack of formal employment, it is difficult to obtain income and thus afford \nnutritious food for a household. However, it has been argued that urban agriculture \nhas the ability to provide resilience and a response to vulnerability that result from \nlack of employment and income. Around 200 million urban households grow food for \nurban markets, making urban agriculture an effective way of generating income \n(Richards and Taylor, 2012). Similarily, Siyakhana has been able to improve the \nlivelihoods of the gardeners by increasing their access to food through the produce \nand income, despite their lack of human capital. These were the kinds of benefits \nthat were observed in the scholarship explored on urban agriculture.     \n5.1.3 Siyakhana as a platform for learning \nAn important finding in the investigation is that many of the gardeners were unable to \ncomplete school. Evidently, it led to a struggle to find employment and played a role \nin the livelihoods strategies undertaken by the gardeners. None of the gardeners \nhave had any other means of income generation, other than the food garden itself. It \nis therefore clear that working at the food garden is by no means a part-time job or \nsomething done on a volunteer basis. The gardeners rely a great deal on the income \nthey receive from Siyakhana. \nConsiderable emphasis has been placed on how Siyakhana has improved the \nlivelihoods of its gardeners through increased food security and income generation. \nHowever, Siyakhana has improved the human capital of the gardeners as well. In \nsection 4.3.5 of the findings, learning opportunities available in Siyakhana was \ndiscussed. It was indicated in the annual report of Siyakhana for 2011 that it has \npreviously provided training courses to many people in permaculture and health \npromotion. However, the study focused how the gardeners themselves have learnt \nfrom involvement in the food garden. It was observed in the findings that none of the \ngardeners had any farming experience before they began working at Siyakhana. \nTherefore everything they learnt regarding permaculture had been taught to them \nwhile working at the food garden.  \n69 \n \nThe fact that the gardeners were able to become trained in farming with vegetables, \nfruits and herbs owing to their involvement in Siyakhana relates to what Carney \n(1999) observes about livelihoods approaches. For Carney (1999), livelihoods \napproaches assist people in developing their own potential. Therefore, in the same \nway, Siyakhana has helped the gardeners to develop their own potential by teaching \nthe gardeners. This is very important in creating sustainable livelihoods where \npeople are not only ensured food security or income temporarily, but that these \nbenefits can be experienced in the long term.  \nTraining the gardeners in farming practices may give them the opportunity to adopt \nadded livelihoods strategies. Krantz (2001) noted that people have to undertake \ncombinations of livelihood strategies for survival, but that these livelihood strategies \nvary according to different households and their different situations. For the \ngardeners, due to their lack of human capital, their ability to undertake livelihood \nstrategies such as formal employment has proven to be difficult. Therefore, it may be \nessential for them to adopt more livelihood strategies than those who receive a \nsteady income. Siyakhana has thus given the gardeners the ability to adopt added \nlivelihoods strategies by skilling them in farming. It was noted in section 4.3.5 of the \nfindings that one of the gardeners had taken what he had learnt from the garden and \napplied it elsewhere. He currently has created his own garden where he grows herbs \nto help his family overcome illnesses. He indicated that this gives him the opportunity \nto save money that would have otherwise been spent on expensive pharmaceutical \nmedication.        \n5.2 Institutional support for Siyakhana \nAn important part of the investigation on Siyakhana was looking into the institutional \nsupport for the Siyakhana initiative and urban agriculture as a whole. The research \nhas thus far discussed and analysed the vulnerability context, livelihoods assets and \nlivelihoods strategies of the gardeners. However, it has been noted by Krantz (2001) \nthat it is not sufficient to simply observe these components only, but that institutional \nprocesses and structures are important as well. Serrat (2008) observes that \nlivelihood strategies are not just influenced by access to assets or the vulnerability \ncontext but that they are also impacted by structures and processes.   \n70 \n \nInstitutional processes and structures are important to food garden projects and \ninitiatives such as Siyakhana because it contributes to the overall sustainability of a \nfood garden. Without resources or financial support it becomes very difficult for \nurban farms to survive on their own means. Therefore, in an attempt to understand \nthe institutional scope within Siyakhana, interviews with the Director of Siyakhana \nand the CoJ official was a key component in the findings.      \nIn section 4.4.1 of the findings chapter, it was found that Siyakhana received a \nconsiderable amount of support when the project began. It was noted that the City of \nJohannesburg extended their support by initiating a mapping exercise to find an \nappropriate area for the food garden to take place. An important finding was that the \nDirector revealed that most of the funding that Siyakhana received was as a result of \nresearch, consultation and training and that they derived very little funding from the \nfood garden itself. This emphasises the importance of institutional processes and \nstructures and links to Solesburg’s (2003) point that institutional factors largely \nimpact upon the scope of sustainable livelihoods outcomes. The purpose of \nSiyakhana is to improve the livelihoods of the urban poor, although it may not be \nable to do so without the support of various organisations. The Director indicated that \nSiyakhana is financially dependent on these organisations, which means that their \nconstant liaising with these organisations to create networks is paramount. Van \nStaden (2014) observes that urban food production needs structural support such as \nthe city administration if it at all is going to be sustainable.    \nAnother important finding in the investigation was discussed in section 4.4.2. The \nrole of the City in urban agriculture was an important issue to explore because it \nproduces an understanding of the implications of urban agriculture for urban \nplanning. It was found in this section that there was a difference in the perceptions of \nthe members of Siyakhana compared to that of the City. Firstly, both the Director and \nsupervisor felt that there needed to be more support for initiatives such as Siyakhana \nand for urban agriculture as a whole. For the supervisor, the concern lies with the \nfact that although there has been support through workshops and forums, there is \nstill a need for assistance with training and funding. His point relates to Morse et al. \n(2009) argument that observing the institutional context is important. The point made \nwas that institutions can provide support with various necessities such as providing \ninformation to farmers, as well as assistance with farming affairs. Similarly, this is the \n71 \n \nnature of support that is required by Siyakhana and may be the kind of support that \nmany other urban food gardens in Johannesburg may require. Malan (2015) explains \nthat currently there is support through training but that the training on things such as \npermaculture is often not done properly. This proves what the supervisor pointed out \nin the findings that even though the City has set up the Agri-Resource Centres, they \nhave not been managed properly. Therefore, they cannot be seen as reasonable \nsupport from the City.   \nMalan (2015), however, does point out that if organisations are going to be able to \nhelp with training programmes the farmers need to be well organised. It is also \nsuggested that the City consider funding links with Sector Education and Training \nAuthority (SETA) and Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) and \nthe Agri-Resource Centres. Siyakhana is a well organised food garden project but if \nurban agriculture is going to gain support there may be a need for collaboration by all \nfarmers or urban agriculture initiatives to become more structured which could lead \nto more efficient cooperation and recognition from the City.          \nNevertheless much like the supervisor, the Director expressed the need for much \nmore recognition of urban agriculture and food garden projects. He suggested that \nthe City needs to show its support by incorporating urban agriculture into plans by \nengaging in projects that can be replicated to communities. The need for institutional \ninvolvement in urban agriculture is evidently a shared view in much research done \non urban agriculture. There is the perception that if urban food production is going to \ncontinue to be rewarding to the urban poor, those involved in urban farming need to \nteam up with local government to develop new approaches that are specific to the \nneeds of poor households (White and Hamm, 2014). \nThis leads to the second point where in section 4.4.2 of the findings the CoJ official \nexpressed serious concern as to the lack of recognition of the City’s support. He \nindicated that were in place that support urban agriculture such as food security. He \nmentioned the CoJ IDP made food security a priority, which has been explored in \nChapter Three of the report. His argument centred on the fact that the Joburg 2040 \nGDS aimed to address many of the issues that are related to urban agriculture and \nthe focus of the discussion was the City’s paradigms (resilience, sustainability and \nenvironment, etc.). It was important to know that the City has taken into \n72 \n \nconsideration all the factors that involve urban agriculture such as food security, but \nit was also essential to understand that urban agriculture warrants a more diverse \nunderstanding. It has been highlighted in the literature review that urban agriculture \ncannot be defined simply.  \nTherefore, despite the fact that the City has made food security a priority there still is \na need for deeper support. In essence, while urban agriculture has been mentioned \nwithin the strategy, its narrow focus deals with food security and does not cover \nother aspects of urban agriculture as a whole. It was, however, noted that the City is \nin process of implementing an urban agriculture policy, but it is not quite certain as to \nthe details of the policy. However, if the urban agriculture policy is going to make a \ndifference at all, it needs to consider aspects such as access to land; finding ways to \nmake regulations less restrictive and support services to farmers. White and Hamm \n(2014) assert that municipal governments are in the best position to support urban \nfood production. Municipal governments have control over activities that take place \non land and in that way can ensure that land is not predominantly prioritised for \ndevelopment. \nConclusion \nIt is clear from the analysis that firstly, the Siyakhana Initiative has been able to help \ngardeners obtain an income, as well as save money. Secondly, the initiative helped \nthe gardeners become more food secure, because of the access to income and \nsome of the produce. Thirdly, the initiative has created an opportunity for the \ngardeners to learn from the farming practices and to replicate their knowledge \nelsewhere. Lastly, the analysis of the initiative has however brought to light a critique \nof its business model due to the fact that the gardeners have not benefitted directly \nfrom the produce derived from the food garden.  \n        \n            \n \n \n73 \n \n6 Chapter Six: Conclusions and Recommendations \nThis chapter brings together the key findings and analysis that were investigated \nthrough studying the Siyakhana Initiative. The chapter begins by discussing whether \nthe Siyakhana Initiative has been able to improve the livelihoods of the gardeners \nand in essence, whether it has been able to create sustainable livelihoods. The \nchapter then discusses the implications of urban food gardens like Siyakhana and \nmore broadly urban agriculture on urban planning. The chapter then closes by \nmaking further recommendations that can be implemented by various institutions \nand stakeholders such as the CoJ. \n6.1 Conclusions \nAt the very beginning, Chapter One discussed the aims and objectives of the \nresearch and it was emphasised that the purpose of the study was to assess \nwhether urban agriculture is able to reduce urban poverty in Johannesburg. The \nstudy attempted to do this by observing whether the Siyakhana Initiative was able to \nimprove the livelihoods of it gardeners. As such, the research attempted to explore \nthe social, economic and environmental benefits of being involved in urban \nagriculture. With respect to these benefits, the end goal was to provide evidence that \nurban agriculture does in fact improve the livelihoods through food security, nutrition, \nand income generation. However, owing to the use of the Livelihoods Framework to \nassess the Siyakhana Initiative, conclusions were made that did not have the exact \noutcome that was expected. \nVarious findings were obtained from the investigation which were ultimately analysed \nagainst the findings from the literature review. Thus, a number of conclusions were \nmade about the ability of the Siyakhana Initiative to create sustainable livelihoods for \nthe gardeners. The conclusions from the analysis were made as follows: \n1. The gardeners have been able to benefit through savings and income \ngeneration, due to their involvement in the Siyakhana Initiative. It was \nnoted in the analysis that the gardeners were able to generate income \nthrough Siyakhana because they were receiving salaries on a regular basis \nfor their work in the food garden. The gardeners were essentially employees \nof the Siyakhana Initiative and were not like the usual urban farmers who \n74 \n \nwere discussed in the literature review. Unlike the urban farmers, the \nSiyakhana gardeners were not heavily dependent on the produce that was \nderived from the food garden and therefore were not at risk of seasonal trends \naffecting their income. In addition to improving the livelihoods of its gardeners \nthrough increasing their capital assets, the Siyakhana Initiative has also \nhelped them by giving them access to physical capital (in the form of \naccommodation) which allowed them to save money. \n  \n2. Involvement in the Siyakhana Initiative has given them access to \nimproved food security and nutrition. Food security played an important \nrole in the investigation because much of the literature found that an \nincreasingly larger number of urban residents have been found to go hungry \non a daily basis. This required an analysis into how the Siyakhana Initiative \nhas improved food security and nutrition amongst its gardeners since they \nbegan working at the food garden. It was found in the investigation that the \ngardeners did indeed experience improved food security levels since working \nat Siyakhana. This was due to the fact that they had been struggling to find \nemployment before becoming a gardener and now have been able to receive \na constant income for their households. The gardeners have also been able to \nreceive some of the produce derived from the food garden.  \n \n3. Siyakhana has given the gardeners the ability to become skilled in \npermaculture. An interesting finding in the research was that not only has \nSiyakhana trained members of the public on permaculture, but that the \ngardeners themselves have become more skilled in farming and have \nexpressed their enjoyment of working in the food garden. Human \ndevelopment is an important part of creating sustainable livelihoods and \nthrough learning, the gardeners have been given the opportunity to progress \nand develop their human capital, which gives them the ability to replicate their \nknowledge elsewhere.  \n \n75 \n \n \n4. There is still a lack of appropriate support from local government. In the \nanalysis it was observed that although there is some form of recognition, the \nCity of Johannesburg has still not adequately incorporated urban agriculture \ninto its strategies. It is, however, only fair to acknowledge the upcoming urban \nagriculture policy and the fact that food security has been made a priority.   \nOwing to the conclusions discussed above, there is a clear indication that the \nSiyakhana Initiative has been able to improve the livelihoods of it gardeners. \nHowever, when considering the main purpose of the research, which was to \ninvestigate whether urban agriculture has the ability to improve livelihoods, there is a \nproblem with the accuracy of this conclusion. The analysis recognised the fact that \nalthough the gardeners have benefitted overall, they have benefitted from the ability \nof the initiative to collect donor funding and not from the food garden itself. \nSiyakhana can mainly be seen as a food security programme; however, it provides \nadded benefits that further enhance the gardeners’ livelihoods. On an individual \nbasis they are food secure, and have sufficient income to cover their basic \nhousehold needs. \nHowever, the initiative can be considered unsustainable mainly due to its inadequate \nbusiness model. The initiative depends heavily on external funding and has no other \nmeans to keep it afloat. Therefore, the benefits of the initiative are not able to reach \nthe wider community of Johannesburg’s urban poor. Currently, the initiative does not \nhave the ability to market its own produce to the urban poor or various formal and \ninformal markets. Though, it is apparent that an operations plan is underway which is \ngeared towards a model that has a deeper urban agricultural focus, rather than \npurely food security and nutrition.  \nIn addition, although there may be a lack of support from the CoJ, there is the \nrecognition of urban agriculture and the need to generate new possibilities for the \nurban poor. Broad strategies have been laid out within policy by the CoJ, such as the \nfood resilience framework; however, it is important to note that although food security \nis important, the potential to improve livelihoods of the urban poor deals with issues \nmuch deeper than food security, and this understanding needs to be recognised by \nthe CoJ. Urban agriculture has the potential to provide a broader benefit to the urban \n76 \n \npoor through linkages to the urban economy, where employment creation, \nentrepreneurialism and further commercialisation of urban food production can take \nplace.      \nThe conclusion is disappointing; however, it leads to view that there might be a need \nfor improvement both internally and externally to the initiative. This means there will \nbe various important implications for urban planning and how it can support urban \nagriculture in Johannesburg. Therefore, a set of recommendations are outlined in the \nbelow.  \n6.2 Recommendations         \nIt is evident that there is a serious need for support from the CoJ. Municipal \ngovernments have a significant amount of influence on the sustainability of initiative \nsuch as Siyakhana and it is therefore necessary that they extend stronger support \nfor urban agriculture. It is recommended that the CoJ increase their support in the \nfollowing ways:  \n1. On a policy level, there needs to be a strategy for urban agriculture. The \nstrategy needs to take into account all aspects of urban agriculture and \nacknowledge that although policy already addresses many of the issues, \nurban agriculture warrants a deeper understanding of its attributes. Simply \nbecause the Joburg 2040 GDS paradigms address sustainability and \nresilience does not mean that it addresses the issue of urban agriculture. \nUrban agriculture requires support, which means security of tenure, \nprocessing and marketing, and assistance with training on farming. Therefore, \nthe CoJ needs to take consideration of all these facets.   \n2. Urban agriculture needs to be incorporated into the planning processes. This \nmeans making sure that those who are the beneficiaries of a project or \nprogramme are included in the decision making. A policy or programme is \ndoomed to fail if stakeholders are not consulted because they are the most \nknowledgeable about their own needs.  \n3. If benefits are going to be felt throughout the wider urban poor community, the \nCoJ needs to make it easier for people to start their own food gardens. This \nmay include releasing some of the regulations on farming in urban areas or \neven making land available for food production. However, the CoJ may be \n77 \n \nforced to replace old regulations with a set of new regulations that are focused \non health and sanitation guidelines farmers need to adhere to.  \n4. Assistance with technology and innovation is another way in which the city \ncan help those involved in urban agriculture. It was noted by Van Staden \n(2014) that technology is an important way in which can be practiced \nsustainably.

Albert Christopher DhasPG and Research Department of EconomicsThe American College, MaduraiTamil Nadu is basically an agricultural economy. Agriculture is the backbone of thedevelopment of the Tamil Nadu economy. The role of agriculture in shaping the economycould be reflected from the large proportion of population that depends on agriculture fortheir livelihood and the significant contribution of agriculture to the state income. Due toits predominance, any positive and negative aspects of developments in the state could belinked with the performance of the agricultural sector. Hence, the concept of agriculturaldevelopment is more of a necessary issue of concern for solving the social and economicproblems of the state. With this background, the present paper attempts to examine thelinkages between rural poverty and agriculture in Tamil Nadu.The paper is organized in three sections. Section 1 presents the present status and trendsin rural poverty in Tamil Nadu. Section 2 examines the agriculture development andcertain characteristics of agriculture in the state. The linkages between agriculture andpoverty are discussed in the section 3. The last section summarises the main arguments.Section 1Poverty in Tamil NaduPoverty can be defined either in terms of biological needs or economic condition. Basedon biological approach, the poverty line is defined in terms of calorie intake and thosewho fall below the poverty line are poor. Accordingly, the cut off calorie norm (percapita per day) is set to be 2400 and 2100 calories in rural and urban areas respectively.Based on economic approach, people are grouped based on per capita income /expenditure or standard of living index. The Task Force on Provision of MinimumNeeds and Effective Consumption Demand (1979), considered the cut off per capita per2month income of Rs.49.10 and Rs.56.00 for rural and urban areas respectively based on1973-74 base year. In terms of per capita expenditure, Rs.15 and Rs.20 per month in ruraland urban areas respectively at 1960-61 prices are taken to determine the poverty levels.The monthly per capita income for dividing people as BPL in Tamil Nadu is estimated atRs.639 for rural and Rs.808.8 for urban areas. The Tendulkar Committee recommendeduse of implicit prices derived from quantity and value data collected in householdconsumer expenditure surveys for computing and updating the poverty lines. The level ofpoverty could be also measured based on standard of living index constructed usingsocio-economic indicators.The prevalence of poverty in both rural and urban areas had been estimated for TamilNadu. Table 1 provides the trends in the number of persons below poverty line indicatingthe incidence of poverty in Tamil Nadu for the period 1973-74 to 2009-10.Table - 1Trends in Incidence of Poverty in Tamil NaduNumber of Persons Below Poverty Line (in millions)Year Rural Urban Combined1973-74 17.26(57.43)6.69(49.40)23.95(56.94)1977-78 18.25(57.68)7.30(48.69)25.95(54.79)1983 18.25(53.99)7.85(46.96)26.10(51.16)1987-88 16.18(45.80)6.93(38.64)23.11(43.39)1993-94 12.17(32.48)8.04(39.77)20.21(35.03)1999-2000 8.05(20.55)5.00(22.11)13.05(21.12)2004-05* 13.44(37.50)5.97(19.70)19.41(29.40)2009-10* 7.83(21.20)4.35(12.80)12.18(17.01)Note: 1. Figures in ( ) indicate percentage share to the respective total population.2. Estimates are based on Tendulkar Methodology.Source: Planning Commission, Government of India3According to the above official estimates, the number of people living below poverty linehad been on the downward trend over the years. During the second half of Seventies,there were 23.95 millions of persons below poverty line that declined to 23.11 millionsby 1987-88 and further declined to 12.18 millions by 2009-10. The decline in theincidence of poverty could be revealed sharply when we examine the percentage share ofpopulation below poverty line to the total estimated population. This percentage haddeclined from 56.94 to 17.01 between the years 1973-74 to 2009-10.The trends in the level and incidence of poverty across rural and urban regions of TamilNadu showed differential pattern. In terms of absolute numbers, there was a steadydecline in the number of persons below poverty line in the rural areas during thereference period, while an increasing trend could be observed in the urban areas up to1993-94 and a decline thereafter. However, in terms of relative shares to the respectivetotal regional population, the incidence of poverty had declined in both the rural andurban areas. In fact, the decline was observed to be significantly higher in the rural,compared to that of urban Tamil Nadu. In rural, the percentage share of populationbelow poverty line had declined from 57.43 to 21.20, whereas in urban areas, it haddeclined from 49.40 to 12.80 between the period 1973-74 and 2009-10.The above analysis revealed that there was an absolute and steady decline in the povertylevels in Tamil Nadu. However, the incidence of poverty varies between urban and ruralareas. The urban poverty situation could be party attributed to the growth in urbanizationand its consequences. The rural poverty situation could be attributed largely toagricultural development, and to changes in the rural population, rural development andpoverty alleviation measures in rural areas. Needless to state that, availability and accessto food stand as a major common factor determining the incidence of poverty.As rural areas in Tamil Nadu are characterised by dependence on agriculture, we shallexamine the trends in agriculture in the next section.4Section 2Trends in Agriculture in Tamil NaduThe trends in agriculture could be understood from various angles. Particularly, aspectssuch as area under cultivation, production and productivity and distribution of landholdings are very much relevant with reference to rural poverty. Hence, an attempt hadbeen made to examine the changes in agriculture in Tamil Nadu on the above aspects.Table 2Changes in Area under Food and Non-Food Crops in Tamil NaduYear Area in 000 hectares Growth Rate in Per centFGCrops NFG Crops GG Area FG CropsNFGCrops GG Area1960-61 5651 1752 7403 _ _ _1970-71 5196 2188 7384 -0.81 2.49 -0.031980-81 4109 2360 6470 -2.09 0.79 -1.241990-91 3901 2731 6632 -0.51 1.57 0.252000-01 3633 2884 6517 -0.69 0.56 -0.172008-09 3191 2633 5824 -1.22 -0.87 -1.06Note: FG stands for Foodgrain, NFG stands for Non-Foodgrain, GC stands for GrossCropped.Source: Computed from Season and Crop Reports, Tamil Nadu (various years).It could be seen that there was a steady decline in the area under foodgrain crops andGross Cropped Area, indicating the negative implications of agricultural performance onfood production. Decline in the Gross Cropped Area indicates that the scope foragricultural expansion is very much limited and fast declining. The trends in the cropperformance also indicate the deplorable status of Tamil Nadu’s agricultural sector. Infact, the performance of agriculture in terms of yield growth was observed to besignificant and steady increase for all crops.Trends in Distribution of LandholdingsAgricultural Census provides data on the number of operational landholdings andoperated area across various size classes of landholdings. The trends in the distribution5of operational holdings, distribution of area operated and average size of landholding inTamilnadu for the period from 1970-71 to 2005-06 are given in Table 3.Table 3Trends in the Distribution of Operational Holdings and Operated Area inTamilnadu ( 1970-71 to 2005-06)YearMarginal(< 1.0hect.)Small(1.0-2.0Hect.)Semi-Medium(2.0-4.0Hect.)Medium(4.0-10.0Hect.)Large(> 10.0Hect.)TotalAverageSize ofLandPercentage Distribution of Operational Holdings1970-71 58.81 20.87 13.09 6.12 1.11 100 (53.14) 1.451976-77 64.65 18.42 11.18 5.0 0.75 100 (61.12) 1.251979-80 69.74 16.82 9.15 3.74 0.55 100 (71.91) 1.071985-86 71.34 16.35 8.42 3.38 0.51 100 (77.07) 1.011990-91 73.11 15.94 7.73 2.83 0.39 100 (79.99) 0.931995-96 74.29 15.40 7.49 2.49 0.33 100 (80.12) 0.912000-01 74.38 15.60 7.26 2.46 0.30 100 (78.59) 0.882005-06 76.01 15.06 6.62 2.07 0.24 100 (81.93) 0.83Percentage Distribution of Area Operated1970-71 17.14 20.47 24.83 24.55 13.01 100 (77.09)1976-77 21.07 20.80 24.59 25.11 10.43 100 (76.28)1979-80 24.73 22.19 23.63 20.18 9.27 100 (77.08)1985-86 25.88 22.73 22.81 19.34 9.24 100 (77.96)1990-91 28.34 24.00 22.57 17.41 7.68 100 (74.74)1995-96 30.26 23.57 22.22 15.53 8.41 100 (73.03)2000-01 30.97 24.56 22.24 15.70 6.53 100 (69.72)2005-06 33.51 25.22 21.51 14.03 5.73 100 (68.24)Note: Figures in bracket ( ) indicate total figures in lakh households / hectares.Source: Agricultural Census, Department of Economics and Statistics, Chennai .It could be seen that there had been a steady decline in the average size of operationalholding from 1.45 hectares to 0.83 hectares between 1970-71and 2005-06. As far as thedistribution of households and area operated were concerned, a swelling at the bottomlevel classes of landholdings could be observed. In the case of distribution of operationalhouseholds, the share of households under marginal group had increased from 59 to 76within three and half decades. This percentage had shown a steady decline in all othergroups of size classes. Though a similar trend could be observed in the distribution ofarea operated, the swelling could be observed in both marginal and small size classes.The above changes in the distribution of land holdings could be attributed to various priceand non-price factors, demographic and economic factors, social and cultural and6institutional and political factors. Needless to say that there is a close linkage betweenthe distribution of land holdings and agricultural performance. In fact, these two aspectscombine together significantly influence the levels and incidence of poverty in TamilNadu. We shall examine the linkages between agriculture and poverty in the nextsection.Section 3Linkages in Agriculture and PovertyAgriculture and rural poverty are closely related and they both mutually influence eachother. Hence, if agriculture develops it would have a negative effect on the levels ofpoverty. Though the causes for poverty are wide and vary across regions, as far as TamilNadu is concerned, agricultural development could play a major role in pushing back thelevel and incidence of poverty. In fact, there are several measures initiated andimplemented both by the state and central governments to eradicate poverty in the state.While some are of income and employment oriented, the others are of production andconsumption of food oriented. In this context, it is worthwhile to highlight the linkagesbetween agriculture and poverty.The linkages between agriculture and poverty could be looked at under the following fourmajor aspects: (a) Food Security, (b) Health and Nutritional Security, (c) Income andEmployment Security, and (d) Economic and Social Security.Food Security: Availability and consumption of food is the basic component of povertylevels. Food production and making it access to people alone can reduce the incidence ofpoverty. Though the Government of Tamil Nadu has evolved and implemented severalinnovative programmes to distribute food to all, particularly to those below poverty line.However, the production of foodgrains and other food crops has significant bearing onthe food security. The problem of removing the shortage of food supply and making itaccessible to the people could be achieved if agricultural sector records growth anddevelopment.7Income and Employment Security: Needless to state that agricultural sector providesincome and employment to the major share of rural masses and it provides economicsecurity to all involved. The rural mass depends heavily on farm and non-farm activitiesfor earning their livelihood. If agriculture fails it has several negative implications ontheir income earning activities and their economic conditions. In fact, the problems ofcrop loss and agriculture failure were attributed to severe indebtedness and povertyleading to the incidence of suicide and other adverse decisions by affected families.Health and Nutrition Security: Food consumption is important to ensure health andnutritional security of people. Indicators of health and nutritional status of ruralpopulation are observed to be relatively very low compared to that of urban population.Agricultural production improves the availability of food items to the rural householdsthat helps for balanced food intake, which in turn improves health of the people. As foodconsumption levels are highly determined by income and employment status, it is moreimportant to develop the agricultural sector so that health and nutrition security could beassured.Economic and Social Security: The ultimate effect of agricultural development isproviding or improving the economic and social security to the rural population. Thebenefits of agriculture such as food for rural population, income and employment to ruralhouseholds, health and nutritional benefits to rural people would get manifested andprovide economic and social security to the rural population.Section 4Summary and ConclusionAccording to official estimates, there was an absolute and steady decline in the povertylevels in Tamil Nadu. However, the incidence of poverty varied between urban and ruralareas. The rural poverty situation was attributed largely to agricultural development,changes in the rural population, rural development and poverty alleviation measures inrural areas. As the performance of agriculture in Tamil Nadu is not impressive, the8removal of rural poverty is an issue to be viewed seriously. It is argued that agriculturaldevelopment can ensure food security, income and employment security, health andnutrition security, and economic and social security to the rural population. Hence, it isnecessary to keep our policy focus towards developing agricultural sector as a measure toeradicate rural poverty.*****References:Dhas A.C (2010): “Performance of Indian Agriculture: Some Explanation for the Observed Trends”in India 2020, edited by Sujs S, Lillan Jasper, Catherine B S snd Jayanthi Richard, (ISBN:978-93-80697-13-0) Excel India Publishers, New Delhi.Dhas A C and M.Helen (2008): “Trends in Health Status and Health Infrastructural Support in TamilNadu”, MPRA working Paper No.9518, http://mpra.ub.uni_muenchen.de/9518/, MunichPersonal RePEc Archive, Germany.Government of India (2012): Press Notes on Poverty Estimates 2009-10, PlanningCommission, New Delhi.Government of India (2005): Tamil Nadu: Development Report, Academic Foundation,Planning Commission, New Delhi.Government of Tamil Nadu (various years): Tamil Nadu: An Economic Appraisal,Department of Evaluation and Applied Research, Chennai.Government of Tamil Nadu (various years): Season and Crop Reports of Tamil Nadu,Department of Economics and Statistics, Chennai.Government of Tamil Nadu (various years): Agricultural Census, Department ofEconomics and Statistics, ChennaiGovernment of Tamil Nadu (2002): Tamil Nadu: Human Development Report, StatePlanning Commission, Chennai.Khan, Azizur Rahman and Eddy Lee (1983): Poverty in Rural Asia, International LabourOrganisation, Asian Employment Programme, Bangkok.Vaidyanathan.

In Shanghai, for a long time there have been peri-\nurban areas intended for food production (Girardet, 2005).\nTerrassa, a town in the metropolitan region of Barcelona, has 1,200 urban veg-\netable gardens, covering about 0.65% of the municipal area (Domene and Sauri, \n2007).\nIn the Netherlands, there are about 250,000 community gardens covering an \narea of more than 4,000 hectares, while in Amsterdam there are 350 hectares of \nland used for urban gardens (Van Leeuwen and Nijkamp, 2010).\nOver time, Montreal developed an UA system based on more than 8,200 par-\ncels of land amounting to 100 community gardens.\nThe United States are the Country that is best exploiting this new approach: \nthe forms of agricultural use in urban areas are reshaping the geography, land-\nscape, vitality and economic prospects of entire communities; it is estimated that, \nin the US alone, there are over 70 million urban gardens (source: WWF). In San \nDiego, UA became one of the tools with which the wide area plan intends to pur-\nsue the regeneration of the entire city, introducing – among the possible uses of \nsoils – uses such as Farmer Markets and Urban Farm, and regulating agricultural \nuses, as evidenced by the “Urban Agriculture Regulatory Summary Table” (www.\nsandiego.gov). In San Francisco, the “Urban Agriculture Strategic Plan” has been \nrecently published (www.sfuaa.org). The whole South Side district of Chicago is \ncentral to a project that will transform the area in the largest urban farm in the \nUnited States. In New York, new projects will supplement the already many ag-\nricultural areas: more than 500 community gardens and over 30 urban farms. De-\ntroit is completing its transition from Motor City (the old Fordist city, par excel-\nlence) to Farm City (avant-garde of the cities aspiring to sustainability) through re-\ndevelopment and regeneration programmes based on the agricultural exploitation \nof urban land clear of demolitions.\nThe growing interest in these types of agricultural activity, and the resulting \nbenefits observed in the urban centres that adopted them, led to the recognition \nby APA (American Planning Association) of the role of UA in improving public \nhealth, increasing environmental sustainability, obtaining social benefits, effects on \ncultural heritage and a better integration of ethnic minorities.\nUrban Agriculture: Main Definitions\nThe economic and productive characteristic is a key element since the first \ndefinitions of UA. Many cultural currents initially converge on the definition of \nUA as a form of economic activity referring to the production of food products \nand no-food products in urban or peri-urban locations (Quon, 1999). This first def-\ninition does not provide for distribution activities, but locates agricultural produc-\ntion in peri-urban areas characterized by discontinuous elements, diversity of the \npopulations inhabiting them, heterogeneity of land uses, discontinuous densities \nand complex functional relationships (Allen, 2001).\nTowards integrated urban agriculture systems: economic and valuation aspects 53\nSome subsequent definitions of UA (Bailkey and Nasr, 2000) extended the ac-\ntivities to include animal farming and fish production, and integrated the concept \nof production with distribution, recognizing the importance of the relationship be-\ntween urban agricultural production and market demand in the urban area. For \nan urban agriculture production system, it is clear that the economies related to \na close-to-market location have a greater weight than scale economies associated \nwith large-scale production (that are typical of rural agriculture).\nIn the same period, another definition develops that associates a concept of \nsustainability to the above-mentioned characteristics, including circularity between \nthe use and return of human and material resources in agricultural activities in \nurban areas (Mougeot, 1999). This approach establishes an exchange relationship \nbetween the agricultural system and the urban system.\nIn its technical publications and in the framework of the UN-HABITAT Urban \nManagement Programme, FAO defines UA as a sector that produces, processes \nand distributes food, responding to a consumer demand coming from the urban \ncontext in which it is located, using intensive production methods and reusing \nnatural resources and urban waste to produce a variety of crops and raise cattle.\nAlthough widely accepted, the definition given by FAO does not cover the so-\ncial, environmental, cultural and recreational vision of UA seen as a complex activ-\nity. Whereas, in the definition by CAST (Council on Agriculture, Science and Tech-\nnology), UA assumes the features of a multi-functional system, comprising a spec-\ntrum of traditional activities (production, processing, marketing, distribution and \nconsumption) and a wide range of benefits associated with spare time, economic vi-\ntality, entrepreneurship, individual health, common welfare of the community and \nthe aesthetic aspects of landscape and environment (Butler and Moronek, 2002). \nThe interest in UA finally extended to the concept of food security and justice \n(Brown and Carter, 2003), thus becoming an element that can provide an assur-\nance system, based on the possibility given to all the members of a community to \naccess a healthy diet.\nUrban Agriculture: a Complex Framework of Benefits\nUA tends to provide its benefits in an overlaid and integrated manner, in all \ndimensions of the urban area; the resulting positive effects are numerous, hetero-\ngeneous and strongly associated with the paradigm of sustainable development. \nActually, the selection of the appropriate types of farming in urban areas greatly \nimproves the sustainability of towns (Deelstra and Girardet, 2000). Furthermore, \nover a long period of time and on a territory able to systematize urban elements \nwith agricultural elements, the benefits are set to grow at exponential rates.\nIn terms of direct economic benefits, it is estimated that the gross yield of a \ngrower that sells directly in a market farm is generally 200-250% higher than the \ngross yield of a grower that sells to wholesalers or distributors; moreover, for 100 \ndollars spent by a consumer, the growers’ gain is 22% on average, while this fig-\nure reaches 30% in case of direct sale (Abel, 1999).\n54 S. Miccoli, F. Finucci, R. Murro\nWhen the balance is positive for the growers, the entire community enjoys a \nnumber of indirect economic benefits that, in the long run, tend to increment and \namplify. The birth of new urban agriculture activities improves employment both \nin terms of number of employees and creation of work groups that turn into busi-\nness incubators. There are several activities associated with job training and teach-\ning functions. The new small businesses that are directly related to agricultural \nproduction may boost the attractiveness and start-up capacity of the territory also \nfor the micro-enterprises that are indirectly related to the agricultural cycle. \nThe general economic revitalization produces an increase in the levels of con-\nsumption, since access to local products with a lower trading price increases the \nspending and saving power of the inhabitants. Finally, a food system based on \nlarge-scale distribution tends to concentrate the benefits on a small group, while \nthe market and local distribution are forms of redistribution of benefits.\nAnother group of economic benefits is associated with the increase in market \nvalue of the properties located in the districts redeveloped through UA actions, \nthanks to the environmental, social and economic improvements that these ac-\ntions trigger in urban areas.\nAmong the environmental benefits, a first group relates to the reduction of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, energy conservation and the consequent reduction of \nthe impact on global warming due to an increased distribution of farm-to-table \nproduce that do not require transport and energy-consuming, environmental-im-\npact systems. Urban agricultural activities can create beneficial changes in the mi-\ncroclimate, regulating its humidity, reducing temperatures and wind action, pro-\nviding natural shading, contributing to the reduction of CO2, reducing nitrogen \npollution in case of rain, reducing noise and containing storm-water runoff.\nOther environmental benefits arise from the reuse of waste products in the \nagricultural cycle, in particular bio-waste recycling and the reuse of waste to cre-\nate low-cost compost, as well as the use of filtered rainwater and grey wastewater \nfrom urban sewage networks for irrigation purposes. The reuse of food waste re-\nduces the consumption of land required for the installation of disposal facilities; \nreforestation and terracing activities contribute to the hydro-geological reclama-\ntion of eroded slopes, wetlands, ravines and hills.\nFurthermore, many urban areas are redeveloped due to the tendency of UA to \nreuse empty, abandoned or underused spaces. Uncultivated and interstitial spac-\nes become well-kept green places, accessible and aesthetically appreciated by the \nwhole community. Free or uncultivated areas may become attractive and welcom-\ning places with a view to aggregation and re-launch (Reid, 2009). If the urban area \nis the target market for local agricultural production, there will also be a redevel-\nopment of small abandoned built-up areas in order to use them as market farm. \nIn addition, there is an improvement in the landscape aspects of urban areas. The \nrange of environmental benefits must be considered both in direct terms and in \nterms of alternative to be preferred to a new construction that, if realized, could \nworsen environmental conditions.\nFrom the point of view of social benefits, a first example concerns the access \nto fresh foods by urban residents, particularly as regards low-income communities \nTowards integrated urban agriculture systems: economic and valuation aspects 55\nthat spend between 60 and 80% of their income on foodstuffs (Bryld, 2003); this \nalso has a positive effect on the health of urban dwellers.\nOther benefits directly fall on the individuals engaged in agricultural activi-\nties: as a result of outdoor gardening activities, farmers are more relaxed and their \nphysical and health condition improves dramatically.\nAnother group of benefits is characterized by an improved ability of the fami-\nlies at risk of becoming insolvent to maintain home ownership, thanks to the in-\ncome deriving from the new agricultural work.\nIn communities that have been heavily affected by the economic crisis, the \npsychological consequence of unemployment created entire social groups of de-\npressed people; the psychological profile of the persons, who were re-employed \nin urban agricultural activities, showed an improvement thanks to the awareness \nof improving the food security of their household. \nThere are benefits associated with the quality of life of the inhabitants and the \nredevelopment of the physical environment; UA promotes and strengthens the \nsense of belonging to a community, fostering social exchange between groups of \ndifferent ethnic, socio-economic and generational connotations. The common ob-\njectives of area protection can have direct effects on reducing the rate of crime, \nand on raising common civic sense.\nThe Agro-Urban Integrated System (A-URBIS)\nA society, which has culturally set itself the goal of development models focus-\ning on sustainability, cannot exclude different forms of UA from its possible mod-\nels of aggregation. Here, we are proposing an urban agriculture model designed \nas an integrated system that we call A-URBIS (Agro-Urban Integrated System).\nAn urban agriculture system can be defined as a set of agricultural and urban \nelements interconnected with each other, that behaves as a whole according to its \ngeneral rules and where each element contributes to the common goal of sustain-\nable development. This system is characterized by different, organized and coordi-\nnated, areas that tend to produce an overall balance.\nTo maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of an urban agriculture system, it \nhas to be integrated, i.e. multifunctional, where agricultural areas integrate urban \nuses and functions, while urban areas integrate agricultural uses and functions.\nFor example, the function related to the agricultural market can be located in \nurban areas; at the same time, an agricultural area can accommodate some urban \ngreen functions by integrating the food production system with the cultural or \nrecreational functions of green spaces.\nThe agricultural activity must relate to the urban context where it is inserted \nand consider that the resulting system is, at the same time, a place of production, \na target market, a source of income and an area where people live. Likewise, ur-\nban activities must relate to the characteristics of agricultural production activities \nto share some elements (urban services, infrastructures, lines of mobility, etc.). The \nnew districts could be reorganized around agricultural areas and be characterized \n56 S. Miccoli, F. Finucci, R. Murro\nby the quality of their open spaces, which could become the centres of the social \nand production life of the community.\nThe improvement of the quality of life and of the development of urban areas \nis closely linked with the success of agricultural activities; the better the condition \nof the urban area where the agricultural activity is inserted and the greater the \nopportunities and benefits on agriculture.\nAn A-URBIS is an aggregative model that allows more widely preferable bal-\nances to be realized in the long run. The feasibility of the system is based on the \ngradual consensus of the community towards an agro-urban integration. This con-\nsensus is strongly influenced by the cultural conditions and levels of information \nand awareness (related to the benefits associated with living within that system) \nspread in the community.\nThe minimum conditions required to initiate and implement an A-URBIS lie \nin the behaviours of the main three macro-stakeholders of an agro-urban commu-\nnity and in their interrelationships. These macro-stakeholders are: the Users, those \nwho are willing to start and invest in agricultural activities; the Owners of avail-\nable land; the Others, i.e. the rest of the community that is not directly involved \nin agricultural activities. The relationships that are created among different actors \nand the expectations that people have towards urban areas are the basis of the \nmain issues to be addressed for the start of an A-URBIS (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1. Conditions for the Creation and Implementation of an A-URBIS.\nTowards integrated urban agriculture systems: economic and valuation aspects 57\nThe first issue concerns the Users, who do not have access to land since the \nOwners are not willing to grant it because of the opportunity cost of vacant lands \nin urban areas. Actually, the agricultural use is in direct competition with alternative \nuses that are more profitable for the owner (agricultural use vs. alternative use).\nInternational case studies offer partial solutions to this problem: in many \ntowns, the Users start cultivating vacant lots, without direct consent of the Own-\ners. However, spontaneous activities are limited, not very durable and unable to \ntrigger virtuous mechanisms.\nIn other situations, the administration acts as intermediary for the agreements \nbetween User and Owner, thus playing a key role (as attested by the P-Patch pro-\ngramme of the town of Seattle).\nIn other contexts, it is believed that the problem can be resolved through plan-\nning, that considers UA uses. This does not guarantee the fairness of choices, since \nit establishes a priori quotas of building permits and urban agricultural uses lead-\ning to different economic values. This approach can only be effective in case of \nagreed upon, clear and transparent, mechanisms that do not cause conflicts be-\ntween owners and decision-makers.\nAnother element that can limit the creation of an A-URBIS is related to the \ncharacteristics of land that must be suitable for agricultural use (Suitable Land) in \nterms of location, exposure, size, physical-chemical characteristics and accessibil-\nity to resources (e.g. water). It must be ensured that urban development will not \nprevent access to resources or modify the characteristics of the area. Furthermore, \na Suitable Land must not be contaminated by previous activities. In case studies, \nwhere reclamation operations were costly, valid alternatives have been identi-\nfied, such as activities not related to the food cycle, crops able to filter out con-\ntaminants, crops on raised beds of earth. In order to avoid a waste of resources, \nit is appropriate to previously verify the suitability of the areas through valuation \nmethods, that are current in rural areas. Whereas, in urban areas, these methods \nmust implement mechanisms for evaluating agricultural soils in relation to urban \ntransformations.\nFinally, a vacant land in urban areas is an asset to the entire community and, \nwhen it is located in peri-urban areas that often lack high quality or equipped \ngreen spaces, the opportunity cost of this land takes on new meanings (agricultur-\nal use vs. alternative use). For the Others, an urban agricultural activity has an op-\nportunity cost if we consider the possibility of locating group, recreational, sport-\ning activities or other services in that area.\nPeople, who are not aware of the benefits that UA can bring to the whole \ncommunity, only see the direct benefits of the Users or Owners. This can easily \nlead to a lack of consensus on the implementation of an A-URBIS; transformations \nwithout consent have little chance of triggering virtuous processes, since they are \nmore prone to risks of conflict (Miccoli et al., 2010).\nIn the absence of awareness, community consensus and information, two fun-\ndamental assumptions of agricultural activities (availability of land and presence \nof an urban target market) would fail, thus preventing the implementation of an \nA-URBIS.\n58 S. Miccoli, F. Finucci, R. Murro\nOnce the issues listed above have been addressed, new actors are created: the \nProducers (Users who find it convenient to start agricultural activities) and the \nConsumers (Others who find it convenient to buy products coming from the UA). \nThe future of an A-URBIS and its ability to produce direct benefits to the Produc-\ners (benefits derived from farming) and Consumers (purchases at a reasonable \nprice) depends on the market equilibrium between these two entities. Moreover, \na range of integrated (social, environmental and economic) benefits would be gen-\nerated to the entire community (Communities benefits).\nThe development and efficiency of the A-URBIS system are strongly influ-\nenced by the level of information of the community living there, which must be \nmade aware of the number of benefits deriving from the system.\nFor the Economic Valuation of an A-URBIS: the Approach of Direct Deliberative \nValuation (DDV)\nFor the economic valuation of an A-URBIS, different methods and techniques \ncan be used. In this study, the analysis is based on the monetary approaches and \nimpacts perceived by the users from a social point of view.\nFirst, it should be borne in mind that, because of its multifunctional and quali-\ntative nature, an A-URBIS discloses its utility not only on direct users, but on the \nentire community, and most of this utility is essential to satisfy human needs. \nMany impacts produced may not be quantified and have no market price. More-\nover, in an A-URBIS, intrinsic values (independent-use values)  are various  and \nconsiderable.\nBasically, an A-URBIS is not likely to be generated on public initiative only, \nthrough redistributive policies or standardized functions, or on private initiative, \nalthough associated with the public sector, for the limited role that it would play \nin an extensive and complicated operation, such as the one at issue here.\nAn A-URBIS, because of the fundamental benefits disclosed on the communi-\nty, tends towards the new frontier of the “common goods” that are necessary to \nguarantee to each person the enjoyment of fundamental rights and to identify col-\nlective interests. To be enjoyed, produced and managed, common goods require \nsocial ties, cohesive relations and protagonist, participating citizens, engaged in \nsolidarity and subsidiarity actions.\nFrom an economic perspective, an A-URBIS has its foundation in a platform \nof exclusive benefits, but can only develop through inclusive benefits that, as \nsuch, may be freely and simultaneously enjoyed by the entire community. It fol-\nlows that inclusive benefits are not offered by the market or are offered in limited \nquantities only, that are often insufficient.\nBased on this statement of fact, a few decades ago, the “social use-value” was \nidentified as an appropriate criterion for the valuation of inclusive real estate. This \nvalue did not correspond to market value, but with a larger value, inclusive of the \neconomic impacts of environmental, historical, cultural, aesthetic, etc. importance, \nalso from a social perspective.\nTowards integrated urban agriculture systems: economic and valuation aspects 59\nIf we draw an aggregate demand curve, the estimate of the social use-value of \npublic real property is equal to its market value plus consumer surplus, where the \nlatter amounts to the monetary value that users would be willing to pay in addi-\ntion to the market value for the overall utility derived from that asset.\nDespite the difficulties inherent in accounting for qualitative impacts, the valu-\nation of an A-URBIS can be reduced to a single monetary expression by estimating \nthe “total economic value”.\nAs regards marketed benefits, their basic value may be deduced according to \ntraditional estimated criteria: market value, cost value and derivates. In case of \nnon-marketed benefits, their total economic value may be obtained from their use \nvalue plus their passive use value, which is related to the intrinsic features of the \nresource. For non-marketed benefits, their total economic value - as defined above \n– is to be calculated using direct and indirect estimation procedures, suitable for \nmonetization.\nTo express passive use value, current scientific literature admits the concept \nof existence value as exclusively related to the intrinsic peculiarities of the re-\nsource, regardless of any instrumental use that man could make of it. Also the es-\ntimate of the existence value remains subject to the possibility of identifying the \nactual willingness to pay “just to know that a given resource exists”, regardless of \nits actual use.\nFor the monetization of benefits, generally two groups of techniques are used: \nthe Revealed Preference Techniques (RPT) and the Stated Preference Techniques \n(SPT). The first techniques are based on the concept of complementarity (or sub-\nstitution) of the markets, estimating the benefits through the effects that non-mar-\nketed goods produce on the actual market of other goods. The second group re-\nfers to hypothetical markets, and is based on surveys carried out on a representa-\ntive sample of the community; respondents are asked to state the economic value \nthey attributed to non-marketed benefits. Both techniques may be used to esti-\nmate use value, but only SPT (classified as contingent valuation and choice mod-\nelling techniques) allow estimating passive use value, which may be determined \nthrough the Willingness To Pay or Willingness To Accept (WTP or WTA) of the \nrespondents. For the purposes of a more rigorous assessment, choice modelling \ntechniques are preferable for their ability to examine the attributes that are crucial \nin the formation of total economic value. Despite these advantages, using choice \nmodelling techniques, costs are higher and time is longer to carry out the valua-\ntion.\nTotal economic value can be considered as a valuation criterion close to the \nlogic of estimates, since it expresses a mere monetary valuation.\nAn A-URBIS stands out for its importance, long time, substantial commitment \nof resources and change in social attitudes required for its implementation.\nThese complexity factors, combined with the plurality of common social in-\nterests that the initiative is able to solicit, involve a valuation process open to the \ncommunity dimension.\nFor the implementation of an economically sustainable A-URBIS, the views of \nthe public sector and of the private sector are only one necessary - but no longer \n60 S. Miccoli, F. Finucci, R. Murro\nsufficient - condition. The role played by the community involved is decisive in \nthat, by recognizing the qualitative and quantitative, multifunctional, essential and \nsustainable benefits of an A-URBIS, the community can consciously determine its \nsuccess. It is the community involved that states the value of an A-URBIS, express-\ning its preferences. \nThis approach allows to obtain the sharing and consensus of the community to \nthe creation of an A-URBIS which, without full social support, could never take off. \nThe new participatory processes, based on the direct involvement of citizens \nin decision-making, can provide the theoretical and operational basis for an ad-\nvanced valuation, in tune with the common feeling of citizens, who on the one \nhand are aware of the increasing critical situations produced by traditional forms \nof representative democracy and, on the other, are prone to a wide introduction \nof direct democracy instruments, which in many respects appear to be more ap-\npropriate to socially reflect on the relationship between means and common ob-\njectives.\nParticipatory methods may be classified according to the share of power trans-\nferred from the institutional decision-maker to the participatory context. There are \nprocedures that merely create information among citizens, others that stimulate \ncommunity consultation, some that seek the cooperation of all the participants \nto outline scenarios or identify solutions, and still others that leave the decision \nto citizens. In any case, the intention is to reach democratic, transparent and ac-\ncountable, choices.\nIn the most recent practice, directly deliberative procedures based on assem-\nblies, groups or juries of citizens get more consolidated. Among the various delib-\nerative techniques developed over the years, we mention the Plannungszelle (Di-\nenel, 1978), the Citizen Juries of Ned Crosby (Smith and Wales, 2000), the Opinion \nDeliberative Polls (Fishkin, 2001) and the Consensus Conferences. In each of these \ntechniques, the end result is a preference expressed on the basis of informed, con-\nscious and consensual, choices and obtained by highlighting one’s own opinions, \ndiscussing them and changing them after they have been debated. Information \nand dialogue are the prerequisite and fundamental elements of each procedure: it \nis direct, as citizens directly participate in the solution of problems affecting them \nusing their concrete experiences; it is deliberative, since the decisions affecting the \ncommunity should be taken with an adequate information base and argued with \nmuch discussion and convincing reasons.\nThe valuation based on deliberative participation processes leads community \nactors to formulate opinions of value through an informed, dialogical, negotiation \nand sociable relationship with the stakeholders of the A-URBIS. This leads to the \nprogressive reduction of the areas of conflict, outlining balanced profiles between \nstrong stakeholders and the advocates of common good that often have no voice \nin the matter.\nThese opinions are expressed either individually by the members of a group \nor in the name of the group as a whole. In conclusion, a deliberative participa-\ntory valuation procedure allows expressing a fairer and more democratic opinion \nvalue, since it is the result of consensual and shared social choices.\nTowards integrated urban agriculture systems: economic and valuation aspects 61\nThe Deliberative Direct Valuation (DDV) derives from the combination of two \nelements: a) a participatory deliberative process, which is necessary to develop in-\nstruments of direct democracy; b) the Stated Preference Techniques, which are es-\nsential to capture the value related to inclusive use in economic calculation.\nThe application approaches of a DDV differ according to the characteristics of \nthe A-URBIS to be valued and to the context, in which it is located.\nRandom drawing of names and stratification of the sample that will form the \nvaluation group are the preliminary steps to represent the target population af-\nfected by the system. The procedure consists of two phases: the Problem Setting \nand the Direct Deliberative Valuation. Once the group has received from the ana-\nlysts the main information on the valuation process and urban agricultural sys-\ntem, the aim of the first phase (Fig. 2) is to identify, in an open and participatory \nmanner, a list of utility/disutility items associated with the creation of an A-URBIS.\nBy interacting with each other, the members of the valuation group can pro-\npose new experts to be consulted in order to deepen their knowledge and clarify \nany doubt. Moreover, the valuation group selects and consults a team of stake-\nholders to better understand their point of view; analysts involve other stakehold-\ners that freely ask to participate in the meetings.\nThe valuation group is the community involved, which has become acquaint-\ned, aware and able to make choices that take into account the complexity of the \nissue at stake.\nFigure 2. Phase 1, Problem Setting.\n62 S. Miccoli, F. Finucci, R. Murro\nUsing the SPT integrated in the social deliberative process, the WTP and WTA \nare estimated; Figure 3 shows a diagram of one of the possible procedures for di-\nrect deliberative valuation.\nIn Step 1, the actors (a, b, c, n) formulate their estimate of the WTP and WTA \n(Individual Value). In Step 2, the valuation group undergoes a new deliberative \nprocess. Including experts and stakeholders, the previously set forth reasons of \nthe WTA or WTP are discussed and a new individual value is estimated (Delibera-\ntive Individual Value).\nIn Step 3, the valuation process is repeated again through an additional de-\nliberative dialogical phase. The aim of the group is no longer the expression of \nindividual values by individual actors, but the identification of a single individual \nvalue expressed unanimously by the entire assembly (Deliberative Shared Indi-\nvidual Value). The extension to the target population of the value obtained allows \nestimating aggregate WTP or WTA. The so-obtained result is a shared monetary \nFigure 3. Phase 2, Direct Deliberative Valuation.\nTowards integrated urban agriculture systems: economic and valuation aspects 63\nvalue, informed and mediated among the different positions of the deliberative \ncontext, after consideration of the views of the stakeholders and experts involved \nin the process.\nOnly through a widespread and growing experimental activity, it will be pos-\nsible to improve the validity of monetary valuation procedures that are directly \ndeliberative. The difficulty to implement them and the checks that they require \nshould not discourage their use. The experimental valuation of the procedures \nunder consideration in one way questions the assessment methods that ignore or \nneglect the actual preferences of the community and, in another, encourages the \ncreation of shared solutions. By innovating the ways of participation in civic life, \nmonetary deliberative valuation procedures make public choices more democrat-\nic, enhance the self-determination of citizens, spell out the extent of the value as-\nsigned by a community to goods or social projects.\nReferences\nAbel J.

Strictly  speaking,  the  paper  goes  beyond  a  simple exposition of the value of organic farming, but it attempts to explain the complex ways in which social  capital  relates  with  organic  farming  to  revitalize  sustainable  agricultural  systems,  and impact on the livelihood of communities in a post-conflict situation, with respect to household food security and income.          The  report  hereby  presented  was  produced  based  on  a  working  method  of  ‘‘Colleague supervision’’,  involving  scheduled  meetings  with  colleagues  who  co-participated  in  the ‘‘Organic Agriculture in a Development Perspective’’ course from 21st January, 2012 to the 16th May, 2012.  By this method, interactive students’ group discussions were arranged between March  and  May,  which  involved  formulation  of  the  report  scope,  report  structure,  guiding direction of the report focus and selection of relevant literatures, based on the chosen situation and background knowledge of the problem identified in this report. It was from such mutual group interactions with colleagues that this report is finally presented, with  immeasurable  feedback  from  colleagues  in  pointing  out  inadequacies,  omissions  and suggesting areas of refinement.  Key words: Organic farming, social capital, sustainable agricultural livelihood, agro-ecological methods, post-conflict, food security   1.0. INTRODUCTION  1.1.Background        Agricultural  livelihood  restoration  is  an  important  strategy  for  the  reconstruction  of communities in a post-conflict situation because it allows opportunities for the reintegration of demobilized combatants and the affected community at large, whose livelihoods were hijacked from them during the turmoil; thereby enhancing their livelihoods. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge  about  agriculture-based  strategies  that  can  best  be  applied  for  sustaining  peace, promoting cooperation among formerly hostile groups, integrating former combatants into the rehabilitation of rural economies, and helping displaced persons to resume their sustainable pre-conflict agricultural livelihoods (Birner et al., 2011).       Agriculture  is  the  backbone  of  Uganda’s  economy  and  constitutes  the  major  livelihood source of the country’s population. A comparative view from the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) indicates Uganda having one of the most rapid economic growth and better performance in reducing the percentage of its population below the poverty line, with a significant decline in absolute poverty from 56% in 1992 to 24% in 2010 (MAAIF, 2007 and UNDP, 2012). The country has generally been regarded as a self-sufficient nation in terms of food production due to climatic, economic and social factors that stimulate agricultural production.   2        Out of over one million certified organically managed agricultural land in SSA, Uganda has the largest share (227,000 ha) and is recognized for having one of the highest growth rate of organic  agricultural  sector  in  Africa  (IFOAM,  2011).    Over  75%  of  the  farmer  population comprises smallholder farmers whose holdings are rural-based and are, however, characterized by severe poverty. In spite of the phenomenal success in organic agricultural development, out of the 34 million population 6.1 million (21%) of Ugandans today suffer from undernourishment, with 31% of population living below one US dollar a day (UNDP, 2012).     1.2.Northern Uganda in perspective: Situational analysis       When compared to the rest of the country, however, Northern Uganda (mainly comprising Acholi, Lango and Teso sub-regions) significantly lags behind in terms of human development indicators, with generally poor welfare indices due to the impacts of the 20 year insurgency (between 1986 and 2007). The conflict events had devastating consequences, eroding people’s livelihoods, and creating wide regional disparities  with 60% poverty rate, i.e. around double the rest of the country’s rate; literacy rates lower than national average, and a significantly higher child mortality  rate (MAAIF, 2007 and ACTED, 2010).        The pre-war  atmosphere in  Northern Uganda was that of peace and love,  where  fellow-feeling, friendship and sharing were such cherished societal values based on long tradition of communalism.  In  this  context,  the  strong  social  bond  encouraged  families  and  community members  to  customarily  render  necessary  communal  support  to  each  other.  However,  the protracted  conflict  that  constrained  about  2  million  (90%)  of  the  population  in  internally displaced people’s camps (IDPs) for nearly 15 years completely disrupted the community social support network that in the past bolstered their agricultural livelihood. Consequently, as relative peace returned for the people to move back to their original homeland to reclaim their lives, the region continues to reckon with numerous challenges, such as community and patrilineal land conflicts due to broken community and family structures. This negatively affects agricultural recovery  and  diminishes  positive  externalities  for  livelihood  improvement  from  most development programmes.        Besides, many years spent in the IDP camps created a syndrome of ‘food-aid dependency’, as the people lost the potentials and opportunities to engage in agriculture; thereby having the only option of relying on relief. As a result, the traditional farming knowledge and practices that sufficiently  sustained  the  people  for  generations  prior  to  the  war  is  apparently  diminishing amongst the generation. Young people therefore lack the necessary farming skills, the capacity and the mindset to embrace agricultural innovation and technology as an alternative to urban service-based livelihoods.        Much as organic farming system has been widely adopted in most parts of the country, Northern Uganda’s organic sector has not had much prominence in the region and it may sound unpopular  amongst  most  local  communities,  except  for  some  few  smallholder  farmers  who produce  and  sell  organic  products  such  as  cotton,  sesame  and  Shea  nut.  Consequently,  the agricultural sector in Northern Uganda is currently underdeveloped and relatively unproductive, 3  with annual growth rate of only 1.9% compared to 6-10% annual growth rates in other regions of the  country  (ACTED,  2010).  This  low  agricultural  productivity  has  resulted  into  massive livelihood challenges such as poverty and household food insecurity.       In this context therefore, what role can organic farming play in the restoration of sustainable agricultural  practices,  knowledge  and  skills  amongst  the  communities  in  Northern  Uganda?  How can organic farming contribute to rebuilding the shattered social capital base in the region’s post-conflict setting? How can the synergy between organic farming and social capital provide the basis for sustainable agricultural livelihood restoration in Northern Uganda’s post-conflict era?       The purpose of this paper is to discuss the framework within which organic farming and social capital can contribute to the restoration of sustainable agricultural livelihood in a post-conflict  setting  of  Northern  Uganda.  This  specifically  involves  examining  the  potential  role organic farming can play in restoring sustainable agricultural practices and knowledge in the region  (citing  examples  from  Western  Uganda).  It  also  includes  analysis  of  the  relationship between social capital and organic farming, with an overview of the context in which social capital building can develop in organic farming system. Finally, the paper presents the ways in which  organic  farming  and  social  capital  could  contribute  to  the  communities’  livelihood restoration, with respect to household food security and income. 2.0.Organic farming concept and its role in the development of sustainable agricultural system       The concept of organic farming by definition is regarded as a holistic agricultural production system that enhances agro-ecosystem health by emphasizing ecosystem management rather than reliance  on external agricultural  inputs;  building on traditional agriculture and utilizing both traditional and scientific knowledge. It is a sustainable production system that aims at creating an integrated, humane, environmentally and  economically  viable  agricultural system, relying  on local resources, and the management of ecological and biological processes; biodiversity, thus ensuring  minimum  adverse  impacts  on  natural  resources  (UNEP-UNCTAD,  2008).  Organic farming is generally based on the principles of Health, Ecology, Fairness and the principle of Care (IFOAM).         The  above  concept  therefore  underpins  organic  farming  as  a  production  system  that  can revitalize  sustainable  agricultural  livelihoods  through  the  regeneration  and  integration  of traditional and new scientific farming knowledge and practices in a way that sustains the health and resilience of soils, ecosystems and the people. Thus, organic farming can be seen as an ‘‘insurance  policy’’  for  sustainable  agricultural  livelihood  security.  Sustainable  agricultural livelihood security in this context refers to ecologically sustainable agricultural production that neither exposes local farmers to unacceptable levels of economic and environmental risks, nor results in socially destructive increases in levels of local inequality (Getz, 2008). Figure 2.1 below illustrates the dimensions of sustainability in Organic farming system.     4   Figure 2.1. Model of Sustainability dimensions  in Organic farming system           The sustainability aspect in organic farming system (certified or non-certified) integrates the concepts  of  resilience  (i.e.  the  capacity  of  the  system  to  resist  shocks  and  stresses)  and persistence (i.e.  the  system’s  capacity to continue  over longer time  periods) under changing conditions, while addressing wide range of environmental, social and economic objectives (FAO, 2011).  The  ‘bottom-up’  approach  involving  local  people  and  locally  available  resources,  in combination with  both traditional and scientific knowledge  in  organic farming  improves the resilience of agricultural system to external shocks, and accumulates environmental goods and services  that  ensure  sustainable  production  system  for  the  current  and  future  generation.  As Altieri (2002) states, the very systems developed and inherited by traditional farmers throughout the centuries should be the starting point for new pro-poor agricultural development so as to sustainably manage harsh environments and meet the subsistence needs of the people without depending  on  chemical  fertilizers,  mechanization,  pesticides  and  other  modern  agricultural technologies          Although agriculture in Northern Uganda currently faces various environmental stresses (e.g. drought, declining soil fertility, pest and diseases, climatic variability, etc.), wide adoption of organic  farming    and  the  promotion  of  sustainable  agro-ecological  techniques  such  as  crop rotation, cover crops, intercropping, agro-forestry, mulching, natural pest control, composting and nutrient cycling, can offer the alternative for reasonable production level and healthy crops  and  animals  (EPOPA,  2008).  These  practices  promote  the  long-term  positive  impact  on  the environment  (ecosystem  health)  such  as  maintenance  of  soil  fertility,  soil  water  retention; nutrient cycling; biodiversity and other associated social and economic benefits.

(2011)       Organic  farming  system  can  therefore  offer  a  huge  beneficial  brand  in  the  recovery  of sustainable agricultural system through the application of agro-ecological methods that mimic natural processes. In fact, the combination of traditional and scientific agro-ecological methods and knowledge leads to eco-intensification of production (i.e. maximization of yield) on limited available land, based on good soil management practices. This organic approach could therefore potentially benefit the local community living on marginal land where they are constrained by limited land size to maximize productivity.       But  given  the  existing  social  disconnection  amongst  the  people,  how  can  this  wealth  of integrated  time-tested  sustainable  organic  farming  and  agro-ecological  methods  be  widely embraced  by  the  communities  to  boost  their  agricultural  livelihoods?  In  this  context,  it  is important to first bridge the wide social gap created by the long conflict situation amongst the communities in Northern Uganda, as this would provide the window of opportunity to address other livelihood constraints. In view of the above, the relationship between organic farming and social capital, and how their inter-play could respond to the problem situation is explored in the next section.  3.0.Social capital building in organic farming        The inherent multifunctional nature of agriculture makes it able to influence and address the factors that contribute to community livelihoods. For this purpose, organic farming contributes by  building  up  over  time,  stocks  of  capital  assets  (i.e.  natural,  human,  social,  physical  and financial  assets)  that  promote  livelihood  security  (Hine  et  al.,  2007).  In  organic  agriculture, 6  social  capital  is  regarded  as  the  most  valuable  resource,  as  it  provides  the  opportunity  for accumulation of the human, natural, physical and financial capital assets.        Social capital in this case refers to the capacity of individuals in a community to come up together with a common purpose, based on mutual trust, norms, shared values and networks so as to facilitate coordinated actions and decisions with the aspiration of improving the efficiency (life) of the society. It involves the individuals’ or community’s capacity to access, mobilize and utilize resources for growth  and  social support that  produces long term benefit  for both the individuals and the community as a whole (Munene et al., 2005).           However, social capital in organic farming may be hampered by the perceived indifference amongst the community members in the post-conflict situation, as they struggle to let go of their haunting  past!  However,  it is  known  that  social  capital  cannot  be  spontaneously  borne  in  a community.  It  is  from  few  determined  individuals  with  the  same  fundamental  interests  and values  for  better  life  in  the  community  that  social  capital  building,  organic  farming  and livelihood success can spring; even in a situation where the state’s capacity is limited. This usually occurs when such individuals come together, pull up their limited resources and invest in agricultural ventures. With time, their success stories will persuade and motivate others to join thus  building  up  the  group  and  expanding  their  network  in  the  community.  This  internal networking amongst the community members may then further extend to include trusted local actors for further support and partnership (e.g. Religious organizations, local NGOs, Producers’ cooperatives, Parents-teachers’ associations, etc.).         According to Getz (2008), the key to facilitating ability of community members to attain sustainable livelihood security involves ‘‘scaling up’’ and developing more positive, external linkages in addition to internal networks, whereby extra local actors, including local government authority, regional or national NGOs, and international agencies, develop vertical relationships with community members; squeezing out corrupt local leaders and promoting positive change at the community level. Such a move would therefore shape the community’s social structure and strengthen the capacity of local leaders and the groups in settling community-related disputes like land disputes, and setting the stage for livelihood recovery.  This strategy based on mutual trust, ownership and accountability could therefore vest upon the local leaders the authority and mandate to initiate reconciliatory measures to settle community grievances and unify the people thus boosting their engagement in agriculture.  3.1.Relevance of social capital in organic farming        It  is  within  the  group  settings  that  grassroots-level  participatory  agricultural  recovery initiatives develop, through a dynamic farmer empowerment approach (e.g. Farmer field schools, FFS);  where  farmers  build  on  their  pooled  skills  and  knowledge,  tested  through  collective experimentation; and learn new knowledge to make appropriate agricultural practices and have access to quality inputs, markets and credit facilities (ACTED, 2010). Therefore, organic farming promotes  social  capital  building  through  the  formation  of  new  and  different  groups  in  a community  to  get involved  in  agricultural  production  and  trade  where  they  were  previously excluded for financial and security reasons.  7      (a) Farmer group in a training session                                                                                                                                                (b) Farmer group in a demonstration plot  Figure 3.1.Social group learning and participation in Northern Uganda.  Source: From ACTED in Uganda (2010)        The  importance  of  social  capital  as  the  main  focus  in  organic  farming  development  for sustainable  agricultural  livelihood  is  because  organic  farming  is  a  knowledge-intensive production  system  that  demands  knowledge  about  ecosystems  and  natural  or  biological processes. This, together with the need to exercise collective responsibility for taking care of the natural resources cannot be possible unless a sense of collaboration and ownership is embraced by other members of the community.         As illustrated in Figure 3.1 above, when people come together for a common purpose, they can learn from one another (Figure 3.1 a) and improve interpersonal communication amongst them. The group could then be able to set up communal demonstration farm sites (Figure 3.1 b), where they can experiment on their knowledge and apply it on a wider scale. This information exchange, therefore, not only improves the interpersonal communication in the community, but more importantly leads to fusion of knowledge and ideas in which the uneducated members and the educated members value each other’s ideas, develop confidence and gain from the social environment. This consequently eliminates a situation of social exclusion that usually arises due to differences in educational status in the community. Such initiatives would motivate others to become part of the group and this fosters stronger social cohesion so that the people can take responsibility for the resources in the community.              In addition, organic farming and agro-ecological methods are labour-intensive. This labour demand calls for the need to work corporately so as to effectively and efficiently undertake agricultural production and respond to other challenges in the community. It still reflects the fundamental  importance  of  corporation,  knowledge,  learning  and  experience  exchange,  in accordance with local conditions to solve context-specific problems. For instance, creating water trenches, terrace making for erosion control, weeding, devising local strategies to combat local invasion by pest and diseases, communal construction and conservation of water sources, etc. All these are conditions under which organic farming development can bring together all members of the community. 8    4.0. Impact of Organic farming and Social capital on community livelihoods: Household food security and income       In this section, an analysis is presented of how organic farming can specifically contribute to improving community livelihoods with a focus on household food security and income, under a well-built social capital asset. According to De Schutter (2010), it is necessary to adopt a low-carbon resource-preserving sustainable system of agriculture that can benefit the poorest farmers by  increasing  their  incomes,  and  ensuring  food  availability  of  smallholder  farmers  (i.e.  at household  level).  In  this  regards,  agriculture  must  not  compromise  its  ability  to  satisfy  the livelihood needs of the poor smallholder farmers, address poverty and must meet their future needs.         The means by which access to necessary resources that ensure immediate and long-term survival of households or community can be derived and maintained constitute their livelihoods.  Generally, agricultural production based on organic principles is currently recognized as a major approach to sustainably stimulate agricultural growth and livelihoods; reduce food insecurity, combat poverty, prevent dependency and enhance self-reliance; as well as build a set of specific skills amongst smallholder communities which may positively impact on their well-being and future opportunities.  In agreement, several case studies have indicated that the introduction of Organic farming methods have indeed improved farmers’ food security (Halberg et al., 2005).        In  Northern  Uganda,  as  anywhere  else,  low  agricultural  productivity  and  poverty  in  the aftermath of war are among the causal factors of food insecurity amongst the population because of  limited  household  capacity  to  produce  and  purchase  sufficient  food.  This  limitation particularly arises and perpetuates due to low social capital. Hence, social capital is the key to stimulate organic crop and animal production in the community with large yield returns that can supply household food needs. This is in view of the evidence that agricultural yields in organic systems are often higher and more stable when converting from low-input systems in developing countries, to the level of, and even surpassing yields in high input conventional systems (UNEP-UNCTAD, 2008).          The proven stable and higher yield in organic farming implies that organic farming is capable of addressing household food security in terms of ensuring access, availability, utilization and stability of food in the community. In this case, increased quantity of food produced per farm enables all household members to have access to enough food thus improving household food security. Besides, the network built in the social structure provides a mechanism within which the benefits can spread to everyone, even those who are not part of the group network, since the community network also provides an informal household safety net (insurance) to pursue higher returns and reduce food insecurity of other households. In agreement, Getz (2008) states that the economic benefits of Social capital also have positive spill-over effects for those who may not be part of dense social networks. It is indicated that high village-level social capital increases the  food security and incomes of both those households that heavily invest in social networks as well as those in the same village who are not directly in the social network, although with unequal  magnitude of returns in either scenarios.  9         Besides  the  high  organic  productivity  level  that  ensures  food  availability  for  domestic consumption, the food surpluses can be sold at the local markets from which the communities can boost their household incomes, and develop their purchasing power to enrich their diet and obtain other household necessities (Figure 3). In addition, organic farming ensures availability of fresh organic products to more people in the wider community in all seasons, thus maintaining stable food supply to the population and constant local income generation. For instance, the production  of  vegetables  can  proceed  year-in  year-out  even  with  limited  rainfall  through irrigation, that ensures household food security and constant cash flow. Also worth-mentioning is that, organic farming and social capital contribute to the promotion of other asset accumulation such as human capital, natural capital, physical and financial capital that helps to correct market failures,  reduction  of  inequalities  and  fostering  social  cohesion  (Longley  et  al.,  2007).  This implies the ability to access wide-range of goods and services for livelihood improvement in the community.  Figure 4.0: Surplus production on local market for household income             Source: From Kledal (2012)       Organic farming can reduce poverty and household food insecurity through reduction in  economic  costs  that  would  be  incurred during  the  agricultural  production  process since  the  community  would  no  longer depend  on  synthetic  fertilizers,  pesticides, and  more  costly  agricultural  technologies. This means the farmers would better benefit by saving the cash that would otherwise be used  to  purchase  those  products. Consequently, it can reduce the high annual debts that smallholder farmers face in agriculture thereby motivating even those who might have been driven out of agriculture due to high debts and minimal returns to resume and restore their agricultural livelihoods.        This does not only ensure their household food security, but also higher incomes that make them able to diversify their livelihoods (i.e. off-farm opportunities). For example, they would afford  to  send  their  children  for  higher  education,  access  health  care  and  expand  their investments.  According to Saferworld (UK) and CECORE (2007), organic agricultural initiative in Shea Nut collection in a small women group in Lira district of Northern Uganda strengthened their social capital and skills in livelihood and social matters, even during the war situation in 2005. This not only extended beyond income generation but also empowered them economically through  increased  capacity  to  generate  money  and  expand  their  businesses.  Hence,  larger 10  promotion of organic agriculture in the aftermath of the war could have far reaching positive impact on household livelihoods.             Moreso, the farmer groups, cooperatives and informal community collaboration that establish strong networks with other partners from government institutions, NGOs, and organic support organization  (such  as  NOGAMU  and  EPOPA)  provides  wide  range  of  opportunities  to  the communities through diffusion of innovations (Hobbs, 2000). Through these linkages, farmers would be able to access larger financial credit opportunities and organize for organic certification at lower costs; access export and domestic markets, and have opportunities to gain in-depth knowledge of sustainable organic techniques and markets on a global scale.        In a similar way, organic farming improves household food security and income level based on its incentive of premium prices. The premium prices on certified organic products encourage meaningful economic returns that boost the financial base of the individuals or groups as they are able to earn much higher income rate per product in comparison to products from the high input agricultural systems. However, most farmers would be able to develop better farm planning strategies  to  balance  between  cash  crops  (for  export  or  domestic  markets)  and  food  crops production so that the need for income does not compromise household food security.  5.0. Conclusion       Organic farming is an alternative production system based on agro-ecological principles that can revitalize sustainable agricultural system and livelihoods in a post-conflict setting through the  regeneration  and  integration  of  traditional  and  new  scientific  farming  knowledge  and technologies that sustain the health and resilience of the natural environment (ecosystems) and the people. The introduction of sustainable organic and agro-ecological techniques such as better crop rotation with improved crop varieties, cover crops, intercropping, agro-forestry, mulching, natural pest control, composting and nutrient cycling is a vital step towards the restoration of sustainable agricultural practices, knowledge and skills in Northern Uganda where such vital knowledge is diminishing among the population.         Organic farming can significantly help in rebuilding the shattered social capital base in a post-conflict situation for sustainable agricultural livelihood recovery through stronger social organizations at local levels for collective management of, and access to resources, as well as opportunity for better connection with external policy institutions. The labour and knowledge-intensive nature of organic farming promotes social capital building that significantly improves farmers’ knowledge and skills in organic and agro-ecological farming techniques, as they engage in constant network of mutual interactions and information exchange, and deriving a lot of other associated social and environmental benefits.   11        Organic  farming  system  and  social  capital  accumulation  also  leads  to  restoration  of sustainable  agricultural  livelihood  by  improving  household  food  security  and  income  level through increased efficiency and quantity of production per farm or household.  Sales of surplus production,  constant  supply  of  organic  food  products  all  year-round,  reduced  production (economic)  costs,  group  certification  and  organic  premium  prices  present  the  huge  proven potential  of  organic  farming  to  address  household  food  security  and  income,  thus  ensuring access, availability, utilization and stability of food and diversified livelihoods in the community.   6.0. Recommendations       From  the  above  therefore,  it  is  important  that  agricultural  and  livelihood  recovery interventions in the region constitute wider integration and promotion of organic agricultural production system through extension services.  This would also critically mean enforcing an enabling policy environment and capacity support for agricultural institutions such as National Agricultural  Advisory  services  (NAADS),  NOGAMU  and  other  local  private  sector organizations  that  can  promote  farmer-centred  agricultural  research  and  knowledge dissemination to the local communities, hence scaling up organic farming in the region.       Since organic farming practices are best adopted when not imposed by a top-down approach, there is a need to initiate a bottom-up approach that responds to the needs of the community, so as to build accountability through  increased local community capacity to define their needs, demand and deliver services for self-sustenance. This requires investment in social capital so that learning and cooperative capacity of the communities is built. On this note, community support programmes  should  be  focused  on  rebuilding  the  social  structure  and  empowering  the  local leaders and the communities at large through initiating organic training forum that continuously bring the people together. In otherwords, it is necessary to strengthen pro poor or smallholder support programmes and policy in order to empower the community and enable wide adoption of organic farming with immediate beneficial impact. Therefore, the entry point for implementation of this strategy requires awareness creation among the communities, targeting the youth, women, men and elders of the communities as primary stakeholders and beneficiaries.       It  is  also  necessary  that  Organic  agricultural  curricula  be  integrated  in  Educational institutions such as  Universities  and National Teachers’ Colleges in the region so as to train students who would later contribute in the agricultural recovery programmes; where they will be able to initiate and implement organic farming innovations in the communities.      12  References ACTED  in Uganda (2010).

        "abstract": "Recently, urban agriculture (UA) has expanded throughout cities of the developed world as a response to social injustices and environmental gaps of the globalized food system (including food security, economic opportunities and community building). Due to the limiting factors of the urban environment (e.g., land availability), UA often occupies the roofs of buildings as vacant space to further develop local food production through so-called urban rooftop agriculture (URA). This paper presents an interdisciplinary scheme employed to evaluate the sustainability of URA as a complex system while investigating the potential of URA in quantitative and qualitative terms as well as the environmental and economic impact of different types of URA. The implementation of URA, as a specific form of UA, in a Mediterranean context was assessed using Barcelona, Spain and Bologna, Italy as case studies. Interdisciplinary methods from four disciplines were combined: (a) qualitative research to identify the potential of URA by evaluating the perceptions of different stakeholders; (b) geographic information systems (GIS), to quantify the potential area for implementing URA; (c) life cycle assessment (LCA), to quantify the environmental impacts of URA forms; and (d) life cycle costing (LCC), to quantify the economic costs of URA forms. According to the results, a combined GIS-LCA tool is useful in evaluating the implementation of URA and the consequent environmental benefits at the city scale. Stakeholders highlighted the contribution of URA to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as the potential risks tied to its complexity and novelty. Comparing different urban spaces, the implementation of URA is more feasible in the short-term on the roofs of retail parks than industrial ones. At the system scale, soil cultivation with compost in open-air rooftop gardens resulted in the most eco-efficient cultivation option. Open-air rooftop gardens had lower environmental impacts and economic costs than rooftop greenhouses. LCA and LCC results outlined the relevance of decisions in the design phase regarding cultivation technique, crop choice and management.",

Chi-square and t-tests enabled comparisons among percentages and mean differences between adopters and non-adopters of urban agriculture.

The logit model showed that family size, ownership of living home, job status of HH head, perception toward urban agriculture, market demand, and training and support significantly determined the adoption of urban agriculture. The results of PSM indicated that adopting urban agriculture improved food security. Thus, the likelihood of being food secure would increase by a factor of 0.60, ceteris paribus.

But urbanization is also accompanied by increased built space to accommodate the increased population which results in the conversion of arable land, thereby reducing the capacity for agriculture to meet the increased food demands of the city. If the Urban areas have to depend on the surrounding rural areas for food supply, then there are logistical challenges like transport and warehousing. Nature based solutions include sustainable agricultural practices which has the potential to render cities self-sufficient and resilient in meeting their food needs. It involves working with and enhancing natural processes to address societal challenges. For instance, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) \"address a variety of societal challenges in sustainable ways\" [\n1\n] and provide \"solutions for global challenges\" [\n2\n]. Additionally, NbS can tackle a wide range of issues, including biodiversity conservation [\n3\n], climate mitigation and adaptation [\n4\n], coastal protection and disaster risk reduction [\n5\n]. It is multipronged in its benefits by giving livelihood opportunities for the urban poor besides being the urban lung, heat sink, solid and water waste disposal and opportunity to bring about eco-cultural community bonding. It is primarily recognized that regular contact with nature provides many health benefits and enhances psychological well-being [\n6\n]. Generally, people living in highly urban areas would like to spend more time in urban gardens to get personal satisfaction, mental and physical health, and connect with nature [\n7\n,\n8\n]. Many cities in developing countries are experiencing several adverse impacts due to rapid urbanization, which has created severe negative effects on urban citizens. The lessons from developed countries on how urban agriculture has been utilized to improve the well-being of people could be beneficial for developing countries.\nThe objective of this paper is to create a framework which will assess the amount of urban land which should be devoted to urban agriculture so that the cities are resilient in terms of food security. The research will examine this in the context of a single city as a case study because it is impossible to precisely determine the maximum amount of food that urban agriculture can generate at the national scale as there is no clear data on the amount of urban space that can be used for it.\nThe most straightforward definition of urban agriculture is “growing plants or livestock within and around cities”. It is a larger umbrella which among other things includes farming under controlled environment and encompasses expansive urban agriculture (including backyard and rooftop farming), Covered urban agriculture (greenhouses, including rooftops), High tech vertical and indoor farming (including container and warehouse farms), Aquafarming (controlled environment fish production), Aquaponics (combining fish rearing with one of the above for symbiotic effects), Insect farming (growing insect protein based on biomass, including potentially bio-wastes), Molecular agriculture (lab-grown meat and microbial production of essential components such as oils, vitamins and protein). Nature-based solutions (NbS) on the other hand are non-energy intensive strategies inspired by and aligned with nature, offering environmental, social, and economic advantages for enhancing urban resilience and sustainability through locally adapted, resource-efficient and interventions [\n9\n,\n10\n]. Through NbS, ecosystem services assume crucial roles in tackling urban challenges and facilitating planning for sustainable and resilient urban environments [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. NbS based approaches and strategies is especially significant for smaller urban areas and medium sized towns of India which have limited access to global funding or global food markets and provides the urban poor with nutritious food and extra income. Urban and peri-urban nature based agriculture have become key parts of strategies for reducing cities’ ecological footprint, recycling urban wastes, containing urban sprawl, protecting biodiversity, building resilience to climate change and stimulating regional economies [\n13\n].\nUsing the SDGs as a framework, Urban Agriculture (UA) contributes to global food security putting forward for better nutrition (SDG2); it also contributes to the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services (SDG 15) and engages in climate adaptation and mitigation efforts (SDG 13) for a healthier environment; poverty alleviation for an improved quality of life in alignment with SDG 1, and it fosters sustainable consumption and production practices, promoting better production methods under SDG 12.\nChanges in land use and land cover within urban areas lead to the conversion of agricultural land, forests, and other semi-natural and natural landscapes into urban and artificial developments (European Environment Agency, 2006). This transformation results in the expansion of artificial surfaces over time. Land use conversion of agricultural land in European Union (EU) is 539 km\n2\nper annum, and it was seen during 2012–2018 that the overall annual loss of undeveloped land to settlement and infrastructure development is more than tenfold the area that is cultivated again, and was observed during 2012–2018 [\n9\n]. In the Global South it is observed that agricultural land use changes result in improvements in income and employment, but a worsening of other socioeconomic areas, notably health, food security, gender equality, and economic inequality [\n14\n]. Gardi et al. [\n15\n] introduced an approach to measure the effects of land conversion on food security across Europe, highlighting that such conversion could pose a significant long-term threat to food security.\nThe main planning tools which can be used for conserving urban agriculture include zoning regulations, development controls, urban growth boundaries, green belts, and other land use management tools such as development fees, infrastructure financing, and financial incentives [\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n]. Market based techniques like transfer development rights can be used to achieve land preservation goals [\n24\n].\nGenerally urban agriculture includes production of food items like livestock, aqua culture and bee-keeping and non-food items like flowering, ornamental and medicinal plants. But in developing countries like India, urban agriculture includes predominantly farming of vegetables and fruits. The advantages of urban agriculture are many- improving the ecological balance, quality of life of the urban citizens, adding to the food security, community bonding and employment to urban poor [\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n].\nUrban agriculture contributes to both food security and food sovereignty and is predicted to account for 10% of the global output of vegetables if fully implemented in all cities of the world [\n29\n]. It decreases supply chain lengths and diminishes the amount of fossil fuels necessary for transportation. It also enhances essential aspects of urban ecosystem functioning, which are expected to increase the effectiveness of environmental services offered by green urban infrastructure. It creates community cohesion and creates cultural expression. Entrepreneurial UA activity can attract capital and create business opportunities.\nThe rise in urbanization poses a threat to urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) due to the presence of numerous competing land uses. Land allocated for urban agriculture differs based on factors such as the type of farm or garden, its geographic location, local conditions, and other variables. Land resources are allocated for various typologies such as home-based gardening, community gardens, commercial crop production, livestock and fisheries, and institutional food growing. Local residents primarily cultivate home-based gardens on private property, including backyards, patios, rooftops, and balconies [\n30\n]. Additionally, these gardens may also be established on idle public land adjacent to riverbanks, roadsides, railways, and undeveloped or abandoned areas.\nA community garden refers to a piece of land cultivated by a collective, including organizations, municipalities, public or parastatal entities, situated in various public locations such as schools, hospitals, churches, or other public areas. These gardens serve diverse purposes, with some emphasizing leisure and social activities, income generation, environmental improvement, social inclusion, and community development [\n31\n]. Commercial crop production, livestock, and fisheries serve as viable sources of income generation and livelihood for communities. They typically operate on privately owned, borrowed, or rented land, ranging from small to large scale areas. Innovative and intensive agricultural techniques, resource-saving methods, and controlled environment practices are employed in urban settings. These activities are often situated near water sources and in close proximity to central markets. In Institutional food growing, where the Institutional land is the main source of available land for agriculture. The tenure can be on contract or lease arrangement with an area ranging from medium to large scale. The objectives of this initiative can include providing institutional food provision, enhancing green areas in public spaces, educating about nutrition, demonstrating and fostering capacity development, adopting agro-ecological practices, implementing innovative agricultural techniques, and conducting research and experimentation.\nResearch indicates that in industrialized nations, urban agriculture can supply a significant portion of the demand for vegetables in cities [\n32\n]. In developing countries too urban agriculture goes a long way in achieving food security and creating employment [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n]. However, it doesn't seem like urban agriculture can significantly improve overall food availability in the world's poorest nations, where the state of food security is appalling. This suggests that in order to feed the nation's urban population the required amount of vegetables, the nation would need to expand its overall territory by more than five times. For instance, because of the extremely high urban population in Bangladesh, it would be impossible to achieve vegetable self-sufficiency with urban agriculture [\n36\n]. Another important consideration is land availability and value [\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n]. Planners have to keep in mind that the potential of urban land available for agriculture is higher in the less dense part of the city where the land values are lesser.\nA vast majority of the global urban occupants live in the small and medium sized cities [\n2\n,\n40\n,\n41\n]. However very little study has been done on urban agriculture in these areas [\n42\n]. Clustering research (grouping of cities based on spatio temporal analysis) reveals that small and medium sized urban areas can significantly contribute to UA production since they make up the bulk of urban areas worldwide and in the great majority of countries [\n36\n]. Furthermore, according to the UN (2004), over half of all urban dwellers worldwide reside in cities with fewer than 500,000 residents, meaning that these places have better potential for urban area growth because of their lower population density [\n36\n]. The policies for urban agriculture should target these small and medium urban centers. In short, the objective of this paper is.\nTo examine through remote sensing data, the loss in agricultural land in one such city (Bhubaneswar) of a developing country, India.\nto quantify the amount of urban land which should be devoted to urban agriculture to make the city self-sufficient in terms of food security.\nTo develop a framework which will propose a nature based solution in urban agriculture solution addressing policy and governance changes to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.\n2\nMaterials and methods\n2.1\nStudy area\nIn India, as of Census 2011, there are nearly 3894 small and medium towns which have 31% of national urban population. These urban clusters make up more than half of the nation's total urban area. Smaller urban areas have the potential to significantly contribute to urban agricultural production compared to larger ones. Additionally, it is probable that smaller urban areas, characterized by lower population densities, can allocate a greater proportion of their land area to urban agriculture. One such medium sized town, Bhubaneswar, having a population of 1.07 million spread over an area of 419.10 square kilometers has been selected for this study because of its low density. The loss in agricultural land is studied in a time series from 2011 to 2023 to understand how self-sufficient the city is in terms of food security. Bhubaneswar, the capital of the eastern state of Odisha, is a Tier 2 city, ranked 58th nationally in terms of population, and lies on a very fertile agricultural belt. Situated on the western side of the Mahanadi Delta region along the coast of Odisha, it stands as one of India’s rapidly developing cities.\nBhubaneswar was originally planned for 40,000 people by Otto Koenigsberger in 1948 when it was a Temple town with an area of 16.84 km\n2\n. The present BDPA (Bhubaneswar Development Planned Area) consists of the core Bhubaneswar Urban area (BMC), Jatani, Khurda and Rural BDPA. As per Census 2011, the core Bhubaneswar Urban area under BMC consists of 67 wards (smaller administrative units). The city basically functions as an administrative unit, experiencing growth primarily in tertiary economic sectors such as trade, commerce, tourism-related activities, and to some extent, industrial activities.\nIn comparison to other activities farming is becoming less important as local initiative and policy level interventions are at a dormant stage. Urban agriculture is still not considered as a tool for sustainable development and no attempts are made by municipality to incentivize urban farming. It was only during the COVID lockdown period that there was a sudden spurt of farming activities in rooftop gardens. Because of the booming real estate market, extensive areas outside the core city (BMC) which were originally agricultural lands got converted into residential and commercial built areas (Fig.\n1\n).\nFig. 1\nLocation of BDA in India\nFull size image\n2.2\nData collection and methodology for analysis\n2.2.1\nSatellite data used\nIn this investigation, Landsat series of Satellite imageries were used for the period of 2011 to 2023. Landsat images are collected from United States Geological Survey (USGS) website, Earth Explorer (\nhttp://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/\n) depicted in Table\n1\n. In some doubtful parcel, it was validated through Google earth imageries followed by the ground truth collection. To understand the changes in land use, satellite data from 2011 and 2023 sourced from Temporal land use land cover mapping was conducted through visual interpretation. Ground reconnaissance for land use was conducted in June 2023 to gain a broad understanding of the land use scenario. A comparison of land use change detection was conducted using multi-temporal land use land cover maps.\nTable 1 Satellite imageries\nFull size table\n2.2.2\nData base preparation\nThe datasets were imported in ERDAS Imagine version 14 (Leica Geosystems, Atlanta, U.S.A.), satellite image processing software to create a False Color Composite (FCC). The layer stack option in image interpreter tool box was used to generate FCCs for the study areas. The sub-setting of satellite images was performed for extracting study area from both images by taking geo-referenced out line boundary of the study area. All satellite images have been registered and geo-corrected from the source. The visual image interpretation technique was adopted to classify the land use/land cover for the two temporal period i.e., 2011 and 2023. The temporal changes study in agricultural fields was carried out to know the current status of crop land in the study area. A futuristic approach to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetable and fruits production for the city of Bhubaneswar for 2030 was also attempted. Attempt was made to understand the city level drivers to form a framework with policy level implications to have a nature-based solution which will drive the city towards SGD goals 2 and 11.3. The detailed methodology of the research is described in Fig.\n2\n.\nFig. 2\nFlow chart of the methodology\nFull size image\nThe research process consists of following stages:\nThe population data base was analyzed to study the increasing trends from 2011 to 2023.\nChange in agricultural land area evaluated between 2011 and 2023\nPopulation increase from 2011 to 2023 correlated with changes in land use and the subsequent impact on agricultural land.\nLand area required to make the city of Bhubaneswar self-sufficient in its vegetable and food production till 2030 assessed.\n3\nResults and discussion\nFigure\n3\nshows the land use maps of BDPA at two different points of time- 2011 and 2023. It delineates the areas designated for nine primary land use categories, namely agricultural land, forest land, open space, parks and playground, tree clad areas, water body, roads, transport facilities and built-up areas. The purpose of these maps is to analyze and comprehend the changes that have occurred in the area over the specified timeframe.\nFig. 3\nLand use of BDPA in 2011 & 2023 and its area distribution\nFull size image\nAs can be seen the percentage of agricultural land has fallen from 44 to 35% in 12 years (2011 to 2023) which has been taken up by built up area increasing from 21% of the total BDPA in 2011 to 31% in 2023. The agricultural land area is the land area which is under cultivation and does not include the natural unbuilt surfaces (tree clad areas, forests, parks and open spaces which constitutes a total of 29.52% of the urban area in 2011and 24.16% in 2023). There has been a decrease of almost 5% green cover in natural unbuilt surfaces in addition to 11% decrease in cultivated land over 12 years (2011 to 2023).\nThe study quantifies the land availability for urban agriculture so that the city is self-sufficient in its food security taking into account the projected population growth till 2030. The problem of self-sufficiency is approached from the consumption end i.e. the demand side because of increase in population.\nFirstly, a presumption of giving 400 g of vegetables and natural products per capita per day to urban tenants is taken. This esteem came from the joint FAO/WHO suggestion of a least every day admissions of 400 g of 'fruit and vegetables' to anticipate constant maladies and micronutrient insufficiencies. The worldwide vegetable utilization of 319 g/cap/day for urban tenants is enumerated from the FAOSTAT dataset [\n43\n].\nOnly fruit and vegetable self-sufficiency in cities was considered in the study because urban agriculture has a limited capacity to contribute to the world's grain supply, which requires a far larger land area per ton of production. Producing perishables which are high-yielding and high value, like vegetables, is often a very profitable option when compared to staple crops.\nThe second assumption taken is that agriculture is practiced over the horizontal plane of cities. Vertical farming, or the cultivation of food hydroponically in greenhouses with artificial heating found in tall buildings has attracted a lot of attention recently as a cutting-edge and innovative method of producing food [\n44\n,\n45\n]. The concept of vertical farming is the food production on small pieces of land with enormous yields through the use of cutting-edge technologies, practically removing the need for land and soil. For two key reasons, the vertical farming was not specifically included in the quantitative analysis. First, vertical farming requires a lot of energy, and the practicality of doing so on a wide scale and the yields that may be achieved are still not well supported by empirical data. Urban agriculture is typically carried out on underutilized property with potential for various purposes, such as community gardens, backyards, vacant land, balconies, or rooftops [\n46\n]. Owing to the dearth of comprehensive information regarding the percentage of urban area that is truly suitable for this type of farming, we restricted our analysis only to the horizontal extent of land available for farming concentrating on nature based solutions only.\nAs can be seen in Table\n2\n, in 2011 to achieve complete self-sufficiency in vegetable and fruit requirement for a population of 1.07 million, with the standard requirement of 400 g/per capita/day and assuming that 1 acre of land yields 5 tons of vegetables and fruits [\n43\n,\n47\n,\n48\n], the land required would be 126.36 square kilometers whereas the actual land under cultivation (cereals and vegetables) is 183.86. This implies that Bhubaneswar was completely food secure and resilient in 2011.\nTable 2 Available and required land area to achieve food self-sufficiency in 2011, 2023 and 2030\nFull size table\nHowever, in 2023, with the population increasing to 1.57 million, and fast transformation of agricultural land to built-up use, the available arable land has decreased to 144.88 square kilometers, the city will not be able to be self-sufficient in vegetable and fruit consumption (assuming city’s all arable land that is devoted to the production of fruits and vegetables only).\nProjecting the same rate of growth of population in 2030, the population will be around 3.0 million, and require agricultural land of 354.5 square kilometers to be food secure but has only 88 square kilometers available assuming the same rate of conversion of agricultural land to built-up areas. (See Fig.\n4\n). Figure\n4\ngraph shows that around 2018, the city should have alerted to the rapid land use conversion of agricultural land and taken proactive steps for efficient high-yielding and high-value farming of vegetables and fruits.\nFig. 4\nAvailable and required agricultural land area to achieve self sufficiency\nFull size image\nTo assess what is the percentage of agricultural land required for a city at a given density, in Fig.\n5\nwe plotted the required and available arable land values as a % of total land for 3 timelines of 2011, 2023 and 2030 along with the population density and it can be seen that at the point where the blue line(available agricultural land) cuts the orange line(required agricultural land) the density is 13.5 persons/acre and agricultural land is 40% of the total land area to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetable and fruit consumption.\nFig. 5\nPopulation density, available and required agricultural land as % of total BDPA area\nFull size image\nTo achieve this utopian situation of self-sufficiency many variables need to be considered. Covid 19 has shown us how important food security is when cities having the greatest concentrations of population need to become resilient and achieve self-sufficiency when the food transport from rural hinterlands gets paralyzed. Climate change has also thrown up huge challenges affecting food production and greater migration to cities. For this it is critical for planners to provide for sufficient urban agriculture while making the land use plans, ensuring land availability and water supply. Urban local bodies can designate land for urban agriculture during the zoning process for master plans. They can also implement disincentives, such as imposing taxes on vacant plots, to discourage landowners from keeping their properties undeveloped and unused, particularly if they are not utilized for agriculture. However, if such plots are used for urban agriculture, they should be incentivized. At the national level, there should be policies to ensure urban agriculture by streamlining land and water regulations, ecological and public health acts and also guidelines for image of the city. The Department of Horticulture under the Government of Telangana initiated the scheme “Vegetable Growing in Urban Areas” under RKVY (Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana) for the fiscal year 2012–13. There were training programs and workshop for the citizens who were interested to grow cluster of vegetables at their homes.\nFigure\n6\nexplains the framework to understand the dynamics of urban agriculture- its drivers, impacts and policies needed to promote urban agriculture. The drivers include exogenous factors as well as city/state specific factors which push urban agriculture. In the state of Odisha, the reasons for poor agricultural productivity are many. Fallow land has increased by 3% over 2 decades (from 92–93 to 2012–13) due to irregular rainfall, frequent natural calamities, lack of irrigation facilities and poor soil quality in the state. Irrigation is by far the most important driver of agricultural growth in Odisha as agriculture is mostly dependant on rainfall. There is low level groundwater utilisation due to deficiencies in the transmission and distribution infrastructure of power [\n49\n].\nFig. 6\nFramework to understand the dynamics of urban agriculture at national and local level\nFull size image\nMoreover, Odisha is dominated by small and marginal farm holdings. Around 93% of farm holdings are in the small and marginal category with less than 2 hectare of land accounting for around 75% of the total land. A large part of Odisha is mono-cropped with rice, and remains fallow after harvest during the rabi (winter) season. The practice of monoculture has a huge disadvantage in the form of loss of nutrients, vulnerability to diseases, soil erosion and water loss that occurs due to planting the same crop each year [\n50\n]. There is poor connectivity of urban areas to the rural hinterland in Odisha. Increasing the coverage of surface roads in the state will go a long way in ensuring efficient movement of agricultural inputs and products [\n51\n].\nProcessing of food is a form of value addition that not only increases the shelf life of food through dehydration, but also enhances the nutritive value of food by making food more nutritious and healthy. However, Odisha lacks processing infrastructure in the food sector [\n49\n].\nUrban agriculture has numerous impacts, encompassing both short term and long term. Due to its labor-intensive nature, urban agriculture has the potential to create livelihood opportunities, particularly for those with limited resources. Furthermore, urban agriculture plays a very important role in managing urban ecosystems by mitigating urban heat island effects and serving as a green space, while also offering edible landscapes. The Siam Green Sky initiative in Bangkok, Thailand, established by Chulalongkorn University, serves as an example of an urban agriculture educational hub situated atop a multi-story shopping center [\n52\n]. Additionally, it aids in mitigating rapid water flow during heavy rainfall, thereby improving drainage effectiveness in the vicinity. The temperature within the building hosting the farm experiences a decrease of 3 to 4 degrees as a result.\nThirdly, Urban agriculture facilitates residents in reconnecting with nature and educates them about its abundance and diversity. It serves as a platform for eco-cultural education and fosters social participation through community farming, where individuals collaborate and exchange experiences in cultivating a diverse range of food.\nLastly, urban agriculture also helps in waste management and disposal. Waste water can be suitably treated and used for urban agriculture. The city’s organic waste can be composted and utilized in the cultivation of vegetables and fruits, thereby decreasing the need for landfills. Community gardens and green roofs offer benefits such as filtering air pollution, reducing urban heat during summer, and preventing storm water runoff into nearby water bodies by retaining precipitation. This has been illustrated in the Fig.\n6\n.\nAchieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2 and 11.3 requires a comprehensive and integrated approach. For ensuring food security, there is a need for an inclusive strategy which acknowledges the interconnectedness of various drivers that necessitates urban agriculture to serve as a nature-based solution. Responding dynamically to the urban challenges like population growth, climate change, niche market dynamics, and urban infrastructure challenges, such as water supply systems and land availability, urban agriculture yields immediate positive impacts. These include improved food security, enhanced nutrition, job creation, and income generation, alongside effective municipal waste management through the conversion of household waste into valuable compost. Beyond these immediate gains, urban agriculture also initiates some long-term benefits, encompassing the dissemination of agricultural knowledge, stimulation of sectoral linkages, and a range of environmental advantages—from cleaner air and reduced pollutants to enhanced humidity and greenhouse gas reduction. These far-reaching impacts extend to improved public health, the establishment of green spaces, and the empowerment of women, fostering increased overall well-being. Thus, strategic alignment of national policies is required to intertwine these outcomes with SDGs 2 and 11.3. This necessitates comprehensive frameworks comprising agricultural policies, macroeconomic planning, land management, water policies, and environmental and public health acts. Hence creating a framework for sustainable urban development and exemplifying a resilient and inclusive urban ecosystem. Currently, urban land-use planning often overlooks the potential of urban agriculture as a multifunctional nature-based solution [\n53\n]. Urban agriculture offers various ecosystem services and addresses a range of urban challenges beyond just food production. Enhanced food resilience and reduced environmental impacts can only be achieved if urban agriculture contributes significantly to urban consumption, necessitating a certain degree of intensification.\nOne of the major challenges to urban agriculture in India is that it does not fall under the responsibility of the ministry of agriculture and hence agricultural services like provision of inputs like seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, technical advice as well as ensuring access to clean water, land, and capacity building. These are resources that every farmer needs but are hard to find in urban contexts. In the majority of cities, it may be difficult to secure the amount of land needed for substantial urban farming at reasonable prices. Furthermore, due to local regulations like zoning laws, legal concerns including ownership and hygiene regulation, and competition for uses, even small areas may be difficult to secure in many cities [\n48\n].\nThe dormant state of local initiatives and the lack of policy incentives for urban farming has limited its potential to contribute to food security and environmental sustainability. The urban local body can prioritize the protection and expansion of urban agricultural spaces within the city’s development plans by designating specific areas within the planned area for urban farming and using the vacant and underutilized land for agricultural purposes, and also integrate these green spaces as multifunctional spaces.\nThough there is an excellent opportunity for urban planners to enhance city sustainability by incorporating urban agriculture into the planning agenda at all levels, from the master plan to individual plans, in the global south [\n54\n], especially in India, there is no provision for urban agriculture in land use planning in urban areas, which is one of the greatest obstacles [\n55\n]. There are examples of how urban agriculture has been implemented at the policy level in urban planning in Germany where urban agriculture is compulsory in the urban planning process [\n56\n]. In Dar es Salaam in Tanzania urban agriculture is mainstreamed in land use planning [\n57\n]. The American Planning Association has also recognized the importance of integrating urban agriculture into urban planning [\n58\n].\n4\nConclusions\nThe objective of this paper was to create a framework which will assess the amount of urban land which should be devoted to urban agriculture so that the cities are resilient in terms of food security. Since small and medium sized towns have more land availability coupled with a lower density, they are better suited for urban agriculture. One such medium sized town of Bhubaneswar was studied and by observing the land left for agriculture from 2011 to 2030, it was seen that if the land is used only for fruit and vegetable production, the city can achieve self-sufficiency in fruit and vegetable consumption when the density is 13.5 persons/acre and agricultural land is 40% of the total land area. The rapid reduction in agricultural land in Bhubaneswar from 44 to 35% and the loss of 5% in natural green cover between 2011 and 2023 shows a significant shift towards urbanization at the expense of sustainable practices. As Bhubaneswar continues to grow, the increasing population density might drive the need for urban agriculture to supplement food supply and enhance the urban environment. To ensure food security in Bhubaneswar would require strategies that will recognize the interconnected drivers of urban agriculture and also function as a nature-based solution.\nIn cities with higher density, the approach for urban agriculture would be mainly through vertical farming. The Chennai Urban Farming Initiative (CUFI) in Tamil Nadu, India is an effort to utilize 1000 s of acres of rooftops and vacant urban spaces to scale-up vegetable gardening through a citywide strategy [\n59\n]. Singapore produces 10% of its food through rooftop farming [\n60\n].\nThe main limitations to urban agriculture is the space constraint. The total urban area in India is 222,688 square kilometers. Generally, it is a practice to leave 10% left for open space and if 50% of the open space is reserved for urban agriculture, it amounts to 11,134 sqkm. The urban population of India constitutes 35% of the total population which amounts to 0.50 billion. If the urban population has to be self-sufficient in its fruit and vegetable consumption it will require 60,000 sqkm whereas available land for agriculture is only11,134 sqkm. Despite the space limitations posed by urban farming, it is a vital urban function which is important for food security.\nData availability\nThe authors confirm that all data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.\nReferences\nEuropean Commission.

Transitioning to specialty crop production (fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts) could alleviate challenges. The goal of this scoping review was to understand environmental and health impacts of locally distributed specialty crops in the Midwest.\nMethods\nResearchers searched databases for peer-reviewed literature and agricultural websites for grey literature. Inclusion criteria were specialty crop production; environmental, economic, or health outcomes; Midwest location; and local distribution. Researchers charted data based on the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework.\nResults\nGrey (n = 9) and peer-reviewed (n = 19) sources met inclusion criteria. Sources reported specialty crops reached diverse populations through community gardens and farmers’ markets with positive impacts on nutritional intake. Effectiveness of production practices on soil and plant quality and greenhouse gas emissions was mixed.\nConclusions\nLocal specialty crop production shows promise, but more rigorous study designs with long-term follow-up are needed.\nIntroduction\nThe United States (U.S.) food system, with its reliance on large-scale monoculture, leads to negative impacts on both human health and the environment [\n1\n,\n2\n]. Monocropping (i.e., single crops grown continuously, such as corn and soybeans) was initiated to feed the growing U.S. population during the 20th century and resulted in increased yield and reduced costs [\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n]. However, these advances led to long-term negative impacts on both human and environmental health [\n1\n,\n4\n].\nFirst, related to human health, monocropping has been shown to decrease dietary diversity and contribute to the overconsumption of nutrient-deficient staple crops [\n5\n]. The reduced availability of diverse, nutrient-rich foods contributes to increased intake of nutrient-poor, high-calorie foods, which increases risk of chronic disease [\n6\n]. As well, monocropping depletes soil nutrients over time, leading to reduced nutrient availability in the food supply [\n7\n].\nSecond, as for environmental health, monocropping systems can cause significant erosion and alter the microbial landscape of the soil [\n8\n]. To counteract soil nutrient depletion, synthetic fertilizers are often added to monocrops to encourage plant growth [\n9\n]. Production of these fertilizers relies on fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and can leave harmful residues that accumulate in the soil and leech into water systems [\n10\n,\n11\n]. In addition, farming practices commonly associated with monocropping such as mechanical tillage and use of heavy equipment can cause soil compaction and contribute to erosion, eventually resulting in a loss of soil fertility and reduced carbon sequestration [\n10\n]. Furthermore, compaction can reduce water absorption and increase runoff, which leaves soils prone to drought [\n8\n].\nTransitioning to specialty crop production and away from monocropping has the potential to help alleviate these challenges and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Specialty crops are defined as fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and horticulture and nursery crops that are produced for human use (as compared to monocrops, which are produced primarily for animal feed and biofuels, as well as highly processed foods for human consumption) [\n12\n]. Producing specialty crops diversifies agricultural production systems and could enhance impacts on both human health and the environment.\nIn addition, there is growing interest in local food systems as a method of distributing specialty crops [\n13\n,\n14\n]. While there is no universal definition of “local food systems”, the 2008 Food, Conservation, and Energy Act considers foods that were produced within 400 miles of where they are marketed to be “local” [\n14\n]. Local food systems have the potential to increase access to nutritious foods and improve environmental and health outcomes, but these benefits depend on the supply chain, product type, and local context [\n14\n]. Distributing specialty crops locally could potentially benefit human health and the environment through decreasing transportation outputs [\n13\n,\n14\n]. However, little is known about the environmental and health impacts of specialty crops, including those that are distributed locally [\n13\n,\n14\n].\nTo begin answering these questions, focusing on the Midwest region of the United States is key. The Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota) is the primary agriculture-producing region in the U.S., with the highest number of acres operated and highest gross output compared to other regions [\n15\n]. However, the Midwest is especially suited for corn and soy production, and there is a disproportionate share of acreage between monocrops and specialty crops [\n16\n,\n17\n]. Seventy-five percent of the 127 million acres of agricultural land in the Midwest is used to produce monocrops, such as corn primarily for animal feed and ethanol feedstock, while the other 25% is used to produce specialty crops including apples, asparagus, grapes, cherries, cranberries, blueberries, and pumpkins, along with multiple other types of fruits and vegetables [\n18\n].\nNew practices are needed to respond to agricultural and practical challenges. For example, as electric vehicles become more common, the demand for corn ethanol will decrease alongside a decreased demand for gasoline [\n19\n]. Given the unpredictability of the future of this market, farmers would benefit from diversifying with higher value crops to remain viable [\n20\n]. However, major changes to agricultural systems typically occur first on small scales before diffusing across the country [\n4\n]. Thus, beginning with a focus on the Midwest, with its reliance on monocrops and related challenges to specialty crop production, could lead to implications for other regions of the U.S. and expanded specialty crop production across the country.\nTaken together, a deeper understanding of the potential environmental and health impacts of locally distributed specialty crops in the Midwest is necessary to inform next steps for expanding specialty crop production. Thus, the goal of this study was to understand environmental and health impacts of locally distributed specialty crops in the Midwest.\nMethods\nScoping review methodology was used to examine links between diverse fields of study (agriculture, environment, human health and nutrition) and provide flexibility in investigating complex relationships between factors across disciplines [\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n]. PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines were followed (see Supplementary File) [\n24\n]. Data are available upon reasonable request to the authors.\nData sources\nThe scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted from March to April 2023. The search for peer-reviewed literature was conducted through searching the databases Cab Direct, PubMed, Environment Complete, and Academic Search Complete for search terms developed in consultation with a research librarian. Key search terms focused on the agricultural production practices (e.g., local food systems, short food supply chains, specialty crops, and alternative food networks), location (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota), and impacts (e.g., nutrition, health, chronic disease, economic benefit, rural development, environmental impact, and climate change), see the Appendix for the complete search strategy.\nThe search for grey literature was conducted through a customized internet and database search [\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n]. Search terms were modified from the peer-reviewed literature search, as the website and database search engines do not have the ability for complex search syntax. Thus, we searched for “specialty” or “local” or “supply chain” in the Land-Grant Impact Statements database, North Central Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE), USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, Center for Rural Affairs, and Specialty Growers’ Associations and Cooperative Extension System websites for each of the Midwest states. Searches were adapted based on each website’s area of focus and search function capabilities; for example, the Land Grant Impact Statements database allowed filtering by region, and the SARE website included search parameters for specific commodities and year of publication, see Table 1 for details. Events, staff member biographies, and marketing posts were removed from initial search results.\nStudy selection\nPeer-reviewed literature and grey literature sources were included if they (1) focused on specialty crop production (i.e., fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and/or nursery crops including floriculture) [\n29\n], (2) included environmental (biodiversity, climate change, soil health, water quality, tillage practices, and soil fertility) or health outcomes (fruit and vegetable intake, food security, and chronic disease), (3) took place in the Midwest (MI, OH, IN, IL, WI, MN, IA, MO, KS, NE, SD, and ND) [\n30\n], (4) included local product distribution (as defined by the authors), (5) were written in English, and (6) were published between 2004 and 2023 (to align with the initiation of the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004) [\n29\n].\nTwo authors independently reviewed each peer-reviewed publication’s title for inclusion or exclusion. Authors met to resolve discrepancies and used a senior researcher to assist with resolving, if necessary. Next, for the included articles, two authors reviewed each publication’s abstract, coded for inclusion/exclusion, and resolved using the same process. Finally, for the included articles, two authors reviewed the full text, determined inclusion/exclusion, and resolved. As grey literature typically does not contain a descriptive abstract, we used a simplified approach. Two authors independently reviewed the title of each grey literature publication, coded for inclusion or exclusion, and met to resolve discrepancies. For included grey literature, two authors reviewed the full text, determined inclusion/exclusion, and resolved.\nData charting\nData were extracted using a coding guide based on the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) Framework, which was developed to speed the translation of research to practice by considering both the individual and organizational factors that determine overall impact of interventions in real world settings [\n31\n]. RE-AIM dimensions assess intervention\nreach\n(number, proportion, and representativeness of individuals who participate or are influenced),\neffectiveness\n(impacts on primary outcomes),\nadoption\n(number, proportion, and representativeness of staff or settings willing to initiate),\nimplementation\n(cost and consistency of delivery), and\nmaintenance\n(long-term impacts on primary outcomes and long-term institutionalization within organizations) [\n31\n]. Operationalization of each dimension for this study is detailed in Table 2.\nCritical appraisal of the evidence was not included due to the pragmatic nature of the research, inclusion of grey literature, and broad nature of the research topic [\n22\n,\n32\n]. Two authors independently coded two sources and met to discuss and resolve discrepancies. The data charting form was then refined based on items that were deemed unclear. Next, two authors independently coded and met to reconcile the remaining sources, consulting with a senior researcher as a “critical friend” [\n33\n] as needed. Finally, to synthesize results, peer-reviewed and grey literature sources were organized by their primary outcomes (environment or health and nutrition) and summarized by RE-AIM dimension.\nResults\nSelection of sources\nThe initial search for grey literature sources yielded 1184 articles. Article titles were screened and 461 were excluded, because they did not focus on specialty crop production (n = 283), were duplicates (n = 153), were not reported in English (n = 10), took place outside the Midwest (n = 9), did not report environmental or health outcomes (n = 4), did not focus on products that were locally distributed, or were inaccessible (n = 1). This left 723 articles that underwent full text screening, and 714 were excluded, because they did not report environmental or health outcomes (n = 545), were not focused on specialty crops (n = 132), did not focus on products that were locally distributed (n = 12), were duplicates (n = 10), were inaccessible (e.g., behind a paywall, n = 8), or took place outside of the Midwest (n = 7). The screening process resulted in nine articles that were eligible and included in this review (see Fig.\n1\n).\nFig. 1\nEligibility and inclusion of grey literature in scoping review\nFull size image\nThe initial search for peer-reviewed literature yielded 3189 articles. Study titles were screened, and 2550 articles were excluded, because they were not focused on specialty crop production (n = 2201), they took place outside the Midwest (n = 179), they did not report environmental or health outcomes (n = 137), or were duplicates (n = 33). This left 639 article abstracts that underwent screening, and 578 were excluded, because there were no environmental and health outcomes reported (n = 260), they were not focused on specialty crop production (n = 194), they took place outside of the Midwest (n = 68), were inaccessible (n = 37), were systematic reviews (n = 14), were duplicates (n = 3), or did not focus on products that were distributed locally (n = 2). Abstract screening left 61 articles that underwent full text screening, and 42 were excluded, because they did not report environmental or health outcomes (n = 16), were not focused on specialty crop production (n = 13), took place outside of the Midwest (n = 6), did not focus on products that were locally distributed (n = 4), were systematic reviews (n = 2), or were inaccessible (n = 1). The screening process resulted in 19 articles that were eligible and included in this review (see Fig.\n2\n).\nFig. 2\nEligibility and inclusion of peer-reviewed literature in scoping review\nFull size image\nFinally, during the data charting phase, the included articles and reports (herein, “reports” is used to refer to both) were classified into either environmental impacts or health and nutrition impacts based on the study outcomes. Of the grey literature reports, eight included environmental impacts and one included health and nutrition impacts. Of the peer-reviewed articles, five included environmental impacts and 14 included health and nutrition impacts. Thus, for data charting and analysis, reports were organized by environmental impacts (n = 13) and health and nutrition impacts (n = 15). Peer-reviewed and grey literature are presented together to consolidate all available evidence [\n34\n]. Scoping review data is organized by RE-AIM dimension for reports detailing environmental impacts, followed by reports detailing health and nutrition impacts. Results by RE-AIM dimension for comprehensive data (i.e., reported in most sources) are detailed in Tables 3–6.\nCharacteristics of sources\nEnvironmental impacts\nReach.\nStudies took place across the Midwestern states: Minnesota [\n35\n], Indiana [\n36\n,\n37\n], Wisconsin [\n38\n], Michigan [\n39\n,\n40\n], Ohio [\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n], Missouri [\n44\n,\n45\n], and Illinois [\n46\n,\n47\n]. Consumer distribution channels varied across studies. Most commonly, channels included gardens (private, community, and institutional) and farmers’ markets [\n35\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n47\n]. Less commonly, studies described other methods of distribution, including food system venues [\n37\n], urban farms [\n35\n,\n47\n], Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) [\n36\n], you-pick operations [\n44\n,\n45\n], restaurants [\n44\n], food pantries [\n46\n], cooperatives [\n38\n,\n46\n], and campus dining halls [\n40\n]. Overall, there was much variation in the channels used to distribute specialty crops to consumers.\nEffectiveness.\nThe 13 included studies varied in their aims and research designs. Study aims included assessing home and community gardens [\n35\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n47\n], specific production practices (e.g., hoop houses or high tunnels) [\n37\n,\n40\n], amendments (biochar or other organic amendments and decomposition specialty fungi) [\n36\n,\n38\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n], pest control (e.g., copper fungicides) [\n39\n], and food waste reduction practices [\n41\n]. No studies compared environmental outcomes of specialty crops compared to monoculture/commodity crop systems. Research designs were observational and experimental, with approaches including paired comparison [\n35\n,\n36\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n] and pragmatic pre–post or single timepoint assessment designs [\n37\n,\n40\n,\n41\n,\n47\n].\nThe studies focused on diverse environmental outcomes, including soil health and quality, GHG impact, and plant quality. Soil health and quality was assessed through measures including chemical, biological, and physical properties including texture [\n35\n,\n42\n,\n43\n], density [\n35\n], aggregate stability [\n35\n], nutrients [\n35\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n43\n,\n45\n,\n47\n], pH [\n35\n,\n38\n,\n43\n,\n45\n,\n47\n], organic matter [\n35\n,\n38\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n47\n], heavy metals [\n43\n], water infiltration rate [\n35\n,\n43\n], hydraulic conductivity [\n35\n], microbial activity [\n38\n,\n42\n], nematode trophic composition [\n42\n,\n47\n], and insect biodiversity [\n35\n]. GHG impact was primarily assessed indirectly through these soil measures (i.e., soil’s ability to store GHG that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere) as well as by measuring reduction of food waste and comparison of carbon dioxide emitted through production in different climatic zones [\n40\n,\n41\n]. Plant quality was assessed through plant size and productivity, disease presence and management, and pest issues [\n36\n,\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n42\n,\n44\n,\n46\n]. Finally, two studies assessed crop diversity, one among community gardens and one among high tunnel users [\n37\n,\n43\n]. Overall, there are a variety of research questions asked related to the effectiveness of specialty crops, and multiple methods of answering these questions.\nAs for the study results, soil health and quality outcomes were mixed, depending on the production practices used. Improvements to soil pH were found through the use of biochar and copper-resistant soil bacteria [\n39\n,\n45\n,\n46\n], while other studies found no difference in soil health using practices including biochar, wine cap mushrooms as a soil amendment, or hyperaccumulating plants (alfalfa) [\n36\n,\n38\n]. As for other observations of home and community gardens, two studies found mixed properties of soil health in urban home food gardens [\n43\n], while another found that assessing existing soil quality when establishing new food production sites in urban areas is more important than applying specific amendments [\n35\n]. One study found a reduction in food waste by working with farmers to use seconds and between-market produce to create value-added products [\n41\n].\nRegarding plant quality, primarily positive outcomes were found through the use of specific production practices, including worm casting; azomite; and soil, copper, and biochar amendments [\n36\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n46\n]; combined amendments (e.g., pine bark and coffee grounds) produced mixed results [\n44\n]. Yields were improved through [\n37\n] worm casting and azomite in greenhouses and gardens as well as use of high tunnels [\n36\n,\n37\n]. Crop diversity was high among urban home food gardeners and farmers with high tunnels [\n37\n,\n43\n].\nAdoption\n. Several reports examined multiple farm plots, gardens, or hoop houses [\n37\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n47\n], whereas others focused on a single operation [\n36\n,\n38\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n]. The amount of land dedicated to specialty crop production ranged from small urban gardens to a 40-acre commercial farm [\n36\n,\n38\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n47\n]. The number and characteristics of producers were not typically specified; production teams included small teams of two, family-run farms, and operations including multiple owners and full-time workers [\n36\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n]. Overall, characteristics of farms and gardens varied widely across reports.\nImplementation\n. Production practices varied broadly between reports, with the most common practice being the use of cover crops [\n35\n,\n38\n,\n45\n,\n46\n]. Both tillage and no till approaches were described. No till or minimal till practices were highlighted in three reports [\n38\n,\n46\n,\n47\n], while tillage strategies were discussed in two [\n40\n,\n45\n]. General strategies around increasing soil nutrients were also reported, including soil enrichment [\n36\n,\n45\n]; nutrient cycling, nutrient management, and use of organic fertilizers [\n38\n,\n43\n]; soil amendments such as biochar and basalt [\n36\n,\n45\n]; and compost practices [\n40\n,\n47\n]. Few reports provided information about whether their production was organic or not; two mentioned using both organic and conventional production [\n39\n,\n40\n], and one mentioned growing organic fruits and vegetables [\n36\n].\nTo reduce climate change challenges, multiple reports detailed efforts to find innovative and sustainable ways to continue to grow Midwest specialty crops, such as blueberries [\n41\n,\n44\n,\n45\n], cabbage [\n35\n,\n36\n,\n41\n,\n43\n], and strawberries [\n36\n,\n41\n]. As for cost, many of the projects were funded by SARE grants through the USDA [\n35\n,\n36\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n41\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n]. While the grant amount was reported for each SARE-funded project (and ranged from $7,496 to $198,529, depending on scope), the full costs of the studies or new production practices were not provided.\nMaintenance\n. Maintenance was underreported across the included reports, with one detailing actual long-term results [\n39\n]. Two reports shared plans to continue data collection and develop additional goals following their initial findings [\n41\n,\n44\n]. In addition to extracting data on maintenance of long-term production practices, data were also captured on producers’ efforts to disseminate their work to scale practices to their peers. Multiple reports described sharing the concepts and results of research through multiple means, including lectures, workshops, media, research presentations, and organization- and community-wide educational outreach [\n38\n,\n39\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n].\nHealth and nutrition impacts\nReach\n. Reports focused on health and nutrition impacts also took place across the Midwestern states: Missouri [\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n], Illinois [\n51\n], Ohio [\n41\n,\n42\n], Minnesota [\n52\n,\n53\n], Wisconsin [\n54\n], and Michigan [\n55\n]. One report detailed a study that took place in a small city in the Midwest with no mention of the city or state name [\n56\n]. Food access points and interventions detailed in the reports primarily reached consumers through community gardens [\n48\n,\n50\n,\n52\n,\n56\n,\n57\n,\n58\n,\n59\n] and farmers’ markets [\n51\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n57\n,\n60\n]. Other distribution channels included a CSA [\n57\n], a local food hub (including a local produce market and healthy food café) [\n61\n], Fresh Stops (farmers' markets organized by community-based organizations) [\n62\n], and a sliding scale cooperative grocery store [\n49\n].\nReports indicated that specialty crops reached diverse populations through food access points, including community members from racial and ethnic minority groups and those experiencing food insecurity. Of those that reported demographics, four studies primarily served African American residents [\n50\n,\n55\n,\n60\n,\n61\n], one was implemented in a Marshallese community [\n56\n], and one surveyed a community of refugee and immigrant families (including Karen, Bhutanese, Hmong, and Lisu) [\n52\n]. The number of participants reached ranged from 120 community gardeners [\n58\n] to 1320 community members receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits who participated in a farmers’ market Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) program [\n54\n].\nEffectiveness\n. The majority of the 15 included reports aimed to understand the association between a specific food access point (e.g., a community garden) or intervention (e.g., financial incentives to use a farmers’ market) and fruit and vegetable consumption [\n48\n,\n51\n,\n52\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n56\n,\n57\n,\n58\n,\n59\n,\n60\n]. Less commonly, studies aimed to test innovative local food distribution models (e.g., turning a large neighborhood lot into a market garden to supply food to a cooperative grocery store) [\n49\n,\n50\n,\n61\n,\n62\n]. Research designs were observational and experimental, including quasi-experimental [\n59\n,\n61\n], parallel [\n56\n], pre–post [\n52\n,\n60\n], and cross-sectional or post-test only designs [\n48\n,\n51\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n58\n]. Mixed methods studies were also conducted, although the outcomes of interest (i.e., impacts on community members’ health or nutrition status) were typically captured through quantitative (pre–post or cross-sectional surveys) rather than qualitative methods [\n50\n,\n57\n,\n62\n].\nAs for study outcomes, 11 assessed fruit and vegetable consumption and five examined food security [\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\n,\n52\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n57\n,\n58\n,\n60\n,\n61\n,\n62\n]. Outcomes were typically assessed through self-report survey items, with nine studies using validated measures (e.g., the Healthy Eating Index Score, USDA Household Food Security Module, or Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey) [\n48\n,\n50\n,\n51\n,\n52\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n57\n,\n58\n,\n60\n,\n61\n]. Of studies that assessed participants’ fruit and vegetable intake [\n48\n,\n50\n,\n51\n,\n52\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n58\n,\n60\n,\n62\n] or food security [\n49\n,\n50\n,\n58\n,\n61\n], most found positive results. This included both studies that aimed to understand impacts of food distribution points and studies examining impacts of specific interventions.\nImplementation\n. Reports detailing health and nutrition impacts included limited implementation data. Little information on study funding was provided, with three projects receiving funds through the USDA (e.g., the Healthy Food Financing Initiative [\n54\n,\n62\n]) and others from SARE [\n49\n,\n61\n]. Only two reports used a theory, framework, or model to guide intervention development or evaluation [\n56\n,\n59\n]. Finally, as for the specialty crops available to study participants, most sources mentioned fruits and vegetables without details on specific types [\n49\n,\n53\n,\n55\n,\n56\n,\n57\n,\n58\n,\n59\n,\n61\n].\nMaintenance\n. Most reports provided little or no detail on long-term individual-level maintenance or program sustainability, with only one reporting that most intervention components were not maintained [\n61\n]. Others reported sustainability challenges, including a need for funding and more supportive policies [\n54\n,\n57\n,\n60\n].\nDiscussion\nThis scoping review used the RE-AIM framework to synthesize both peer-reviewed and grey literature on the environmental and health impacts of locally distributed specialty crops in the Midwest. Overall, the available evidence was primarily from peer-reviewed (vs. grey) literature and related to environmental (vs. health) impacts. Here, we highlight key findings and future directions related to achieving beneficial impacts on both the environment and human health and nutrition, including improved synergy between producers and food access practitioners to achieve these outcomes.\nEnvironmental impacts\nFirst, the review aimed to understand specialty crops’ environmental impacts. Results indicate that specialty crops\nreach\nconsumers through a variety of distribution channels; have varying\neffects\non soil health and quality, GHG impact, and plant quality; are\nadopted\nby farms of diverse size and structure; and are\nimplemented\nthrough practices designed to improve soil health and alleviate climate challenges. Little is known about long-term\nmaintenance\nplans. As the RE-AIM framework defines the overall impacts of an intervention as the combination of each dimension, more information on effectiveness and maintenance is needed to determine the extent to which specialty crops improve the environment, and whether improvements are maintained over time.\nEffectiveness was difficult to determine because of variation in research designs, aims, outcomes, and results. For example, the effectiveness of amendments on soil health and plant quality were mixed. While some studies found that plant quality was improved (e.g., through biochar or a combination of pine bark and coffee grounds), overall environmental benefits varied. In addition, multiple studies examined effectiveness of production practices on soil health and found mixed results. Soil health was measured through various methods including chemical, biological, and physical properties. Because of these mixed findings, tools and technology that allow producers to measure soil health at scale and in real time are recommended for future studies. These tools should be affordable and adaptable to differing types of specialty crop production in diverse geographical regions.\nIn addition, more direct measures of GHG emissions are needed to better understand effectiveness. Specifically, there is a gap in practical use among specialty crop producers to measure environmental impact due to specialized food production and varying inputs that are different from traditional agricultural methods. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) can be useful to model the processes from farm to fork and food waste management and identify areas that impact the environment [\n63\n]. Yet, there is a lack of specialized LCAs for specialty crop production, and no reports included in this review used LCAs. To enhance existing measures and increase practical use for formal measures of GHG emissions, literature suggests the need to “identify food-tailored methods in LCA” and a combination of LCA methods to be applied to individual farm and larger scale food productions [\n63\n,\n64\n]. As well, there is a need to identify standardized measures with strong correlation to GHG emissions that are feasible and acceptable for producers (e.g., GHG calculators that have been developed through LCAs tailored to specialty crop production). Researchers, funders, and policymakers could support producers by increasing research and funding (e.g., through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences) to conduct context-specific LCAs and identifying practical ways to measure environmental impact and GHG emissions [\n63\n,\n64\n]. This could also increase the prevalence of longitudinal study designs assessing emissions, which can be challenging, expensive, and hard to control without appropriate measures [\n65\n].\nFinally, more information is needed on adoption and organizational-level maintenance. While much has been studied about the dissemination of agricultural interventions [\n66\n], data detailing specific reasons for adopting specialty crop production was limited in the scoping review, and could aid future efforts in expanding production. More investigations are needed on which dissemination sources and channels are most effective for producers to share and receive reliable information on production practices (e.g., how to manage specific insect and disease outbreaks or develop fruit and vegetable varieties suitable for local conditions) [\n67\n,\n68\n]; this could also lead to improved implementation and maintenance of specialty crop production.\nHealth and nutrition impacts\nSecond, as for health and nutrition impacts, findings indicate that specialty crops\nreached\ndiverse populations through multiple food access points and were\neffective\nin increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and improving food security, while little is known about\nimplementation\nor\nmaintenance\n. Again, more complete information is needed to fully assess the public health impacts of specialty crops. First, reporting implementation data (fidelity, adaptations, and cost) is important to understand whether interventions are implemented as intended, what adaptations could improve fit and delivery, and whether costs are reasonable for long-term integration in systems [\n31\n].\nNext, related to maintenance, this review also uncovered several barriers to the sustainability of food access interventions across the Midwest, with limited funding being the most occurrent. Moreover, many reports suggested that innovative approaches to dedicated funding and buy-in from the community members were needed for long-term program sustainability and expansion. According to Kim, 2016, little public funding is available for the research and development of specialty crops [\n67\n]. And most recently, on August 23, 2023, USDA announced funding for the 2023 Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP), which provides grants to state departments of agriculture to fund programs that enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops [\n69\n]. With this grant, funding will be distributed to state programs across the U.S. to address the needs of specialty crop producers [\n69\n]. In addition to funding, building evidence to show successful outcomes and developing policy-level support have been identified as facilitators to sustaining food access interventions [\n70\n].\nFinally, while effectiveness data was present, use of validated nutrition security measures [\n71\n] are needed, as nutrition insecurity remains a challenge for community members facing health disparities. The food access interventions found in this review reached individuals who received federal food assistance from programs such as SNAP or WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), suggesting that specialty crops are reaching community members facing health disparities; however, the extent to which nutrition security was improved is unknown. More robust study designs (beyond cross-sectional or post-test only) are also needed. Ideally, these designs assess maintenance of primary outcomes 6 months or more after completion of the intervention to gauge long-term benefits. However, individual-level, long-term maintenance is rarely reported for food access interventions, due in part to additional resources (i.e., staffing and funds) needed for maintenance-related efforts and loss of attrition, especially when working with limited resource audiences [\n72\n,\n73\n].\nSynergy between agriculture and health sectors\nMore synergy between the agriculture and health sectors is also warranted to enhance the impacts of specialty crop production on human health and nutrition. Programs that connect food system actors from food production to food waste management can optimize the potential to positively impact both the farming and greater community by increasing access to locally grown fruits and vegetables. For example, this review found that food access practitioners reached community members through community gardens and farmers’ markets, but there was little mention of alternative distribution methods, such as food hubs or other innovative local distribution models [\n74\n].\nOne example is the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s (NIFA) investment in nutrition incentive (NI) programs that increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and boost economic support for local farmers. Since the Food, Nutrition, and Conservation Act of 2008 [\n75\n], the USDA NIFA has piloted and continued to support NI projects that connect populations with diet-related health conditions (e.g., heart disease) or receiving SNAP benefits with various incentives to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables through the Healthy Incentive Pilot (HIP), Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program, and most recently, the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) [\n76\n]. In general, NI projects offer incentives for program participants to purchase more fruits and vegetables, e.g., a SNAP household that purchases $10 of produce using their SNAP benefits will receive an additional $10 to spend on produce at a participating location like a farmers’ market or grocery store.\nFurther, invested parties involved in food production can “close the loop” by increasing food recovery in various ways. Reducing food waste is a promising practice to reduce GHG emissions and a priority area for the USDA and EPA [\n77\n]. However, food waste was only examined in one study in this review [\n41\n]. Given that food loss and waste is a major contributor to GHG emissions (primarily the generation of methane, a more harmful GHG than carbon dioxide) when food waste ends up in landfills [\n78\n], future research and practice could engage supply chain companies and food brands in identifying opportunities to reduce food loss and waste by diverting food waste that can be used in other ways. The EPA provides guidance for sustainable food waste management and prioritizes a hierarchy of the most to least preferred recovery methods: reduce food loss and waste at the source (e.g., during food production); if food is still edible, use the food to feed people instead of throwing it away; if inedible, divert food to feed animals; create other methods or reusing food waste, such as through industrial uses (e.g., anaerobic digestion) or composting; and finally, discard food at the landfill [\n79\n].\nReducing food waste and adopting food recovery practices may also have positive impacts on human health outcomes, such as diverting still-edible food to populations in need and increasing access to food that might have been thrown away instead. For example, organizations such as Upcycled Foods and Imperfect Foods work with producers across the country to develop processes to divert potential food waste (e.g., spent grains) into new products, which becomes an added distribution channel for growers to gain additional income [\n80\n,\n81\n,\n82\n]. If food recovery methods are adopted or desired, communities could gauge the demand for “ugly produce” and upcycled products that are still perfectly edible. This may involve conducting targeted marketing approaches or social marketing campaigns to increase awareness and demand for produce or products that are recovered. Based on communications research, this could include the environmental, resource-saving, and nutritional value of upcycled foods to boost consumers’ interest in their consumption of upcycled foods [\n83\n].\nSince distribution channels vary by market and producer needs, communities should identify opportunities to recover food through local avenues. This would require funding to support research and development of secondary markets and opportunities for local collaboration. These partnerships could involve local food producers, food access practitioners, food businesses interested in purchasing locally grown produce, and municipal entities that oversee regulations related to business or organic waste management. As an example, a farm in Orlando, Florida receives local food scraps from a composting company and wood chips from local arborists to create their own compost [\n84\n].\nIn addition, a potential area of improvement is the idea of refining the efficiency of the food supply chain by connecting actors across the food system [\n85\n]. Often, small producers lack processing or cold storage facilities to take advantage of broader market opportunities [\n86\n]. Supply chains can be strengthened with the integration of food hubs that connect rural, mid-sized, and large farmers to increase market opportunities for local farmers [\n87\n]. While producers can identify secondary markets by selling to restaurants or other institutions [\n88\n], they can also connect with community organizations that might have funding to purchase local produce or are able to receive donations that are unsalable but still edible through “Farm to Food Bank” programs [\n89\n]. These examples can support producers and practitioners who distribute emergency food simultaneously. Overall, more ways to use imperfect or blemished foods at the packer and processor level are needed.\nFuture directions\nFurther investigation of agricultural practices with high potential to contribute to environmental health and adapt to climate change is critical, ideally through large-scale studies with robust designs and evaluation methods. Standardized measures and tools assessing environmental and health outcomes (i.e., soil health, GHG emissions, and food security) are necessary to monitor the success of specialty crop production and food access programs. Multisector efforts such as food waste recovery should be explored for their potential to impact both human health and the environment. This could include research on supply chain infrastructure to assess the limiting factors for harvesting, processing, storing, and distributing specialty goods; and the role of food retailers to address food access while maximizing supply chain effectiveness. Future research could also explore consumer interest in regional food sources; for example, the “Buy Fresh, Buy Local” movement could potentially become “Buy Regenerative, Buy Regional.”\nLimitations\nAs with any scoping review, results are limited by the databases and search terms used, which may not have captured all relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature. In addition, limiting the area of focus to the Midwest may have excluded important insights into environmental and health impacts of specialty crops from other areas of the country. For example, only one study included in the scoping review examined local versus distant specialty crop production, but no health or nutrition outcomes were included [\n40\n], making it difficult to understand whether local produce is better for health. Studies directly comparing the impacts of local versus non-local foods or specialty crops versus conventional row crops could provide valuable insight into ways to improve environmental and health outcomes. Related, the methodological limitations of the included reports contributed to this difficulty, as many were cross-sectional, single-timepoint assessments or pragmatic pre–post designs. As such, observer bias, self-selection bias, or recall bias could have occurred [\n90\n]. Finally, the scoping review methodology aimed for breadth of findings, and as such it was difficult to compare results across studies. For example, we could not quantify the diversity of soil types, textures, or production methods in the included reports\n.\nOverall, it is difficult to assess direct impacts of specialty crop production because of complexities of the food system, and more research is needed to answer specific questions.\nConclusion\nThis scoping review aimed to understand environmental and health impacts of locally distributed specialty crops in the Midwest. Related to environmental impacts, results indicate that specialty crops reach consumers through a variety of distribution channels; have varying effects on soil health and quality, GHG impact, and plant quality; are adopted by farms of diverse size and structure; and are implemented through practices designed to improve soil health and alleviate climate challenges. As for health and nutrition impacts, findings indicate that specialty crops reached diverse populations through multiple food access points and were effective in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and improving food security, while little is known about implementation or maintenance. More synergy between the agriculture and health sectors is warranted to enhance the impacts of specialty crop production on human health and nutrition. Taken together, specialty crop production shows promise for positively impacting environmental and health outcomes, but more research is needed.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe data sets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nReferences\nBourke PM, Evers JB, Bijma P, van Apeldoorn DF, Smulders MJM, Kuyper TW, et al.

The majority of the global population currently resides in urban areas, and it is projected that by 2030, this figure will reach 5 billion [\n27\n]. According to Ethiopia Urban Population (EUP), [\n19\n] report in 2022, 27.959,125 Ethiopians resided in urban areas, a 4.83% increase from 2021. By 2023, 22.9% of Ethiopians were urban, while 77.1 percent were rural. Over the past five decades, the urban population of Ethiopia has experienced a significant and alarming increase, rising from 8.9% to 22.2% [\n36\n].\nThe growing urbanization of cities and towns is eroding the fundamental necessities of residents [\n5\n]. Studies indicate that urban areas exhibit elevated poverty rates that are progressively on the rise [\n48\n]. Furthermore, the urban impoverished population is susceptible to hazards and consistently exposed to risks. They are engaged in insecure employment, either in the formal or informal sector. The urban poor have a greater risk of disease due to their high population density. Additionally, a significant portion of their income is allocated towards food, leaving them vulnerable to fluctuations in the overall economy [\n55\n]. Hence, the swift process of urbanization raises concerns regarding the issues of food security and urban poor [\n45\n]. According to the Worldwide Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report in 2019, 83.8% of the population in Ethiopia is experiencing multidimensional poverty. Ethiopia has around 8.1 million individuals that require food assistance (\nhttps://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/alerts-archive/issue-26/en/\n). Households experiencing food insufficiency would have additional obstacles such as compromised health and diminished productivity [\n56\n]. As a result of this difficulty, a harmful cycle arises where households are unable to generate an adequate amount of food, even during prosperous years [\n1\n].\nDespite several efforts to solve the global hunger crisis, food insecurity and undernutrition remain serious problems in many countries [\n51\n]. While achieving food security is desirable regardless of political climate and socioeconomic circumstances [\n32\n], it is especially critical in developing nations where population growth and increased frequency of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, extreme temperature fluctuations, and rainfall frequently threaten food security [\n3\n]. The agriculture sector plays a vital role in enhancing food availability and attaining food security. While it is widely acknowledged that the world's food consumption will rise over the coming decades, there is uncertainty over the ability of global agriculture to meet this need by increasing the food supply [\n23\n]. Ethiopia's most significant economic sector is agriculture, which provides 85% of the country's total income. Nevertheless, as a result of its limited efficiency, the industry is incapable of meeting the requirements of both the country and its inhabitants in relation to food security [\n22\n]. The principal agricultural regions in the country employ mixed farming techniques, which involve the cultivation of cereal crops, pulse crops, and horticultural crops, as well as the rearing of animals like as poultry, cattle, and small ruminants.\nBased on the aforementioned concept of food security, Ethiopia is among the most food insecure and reliant on aid countries globally. Most individuals have seen both persistent and transient food scarcities, especially in recent years, in both urban and rural areas. Although the per capita food supply has declined, there has been an increase in the number of households facing food insecurity. This demonstrates that over a period exceeding 40 years, the per capita food supply consistently stayed far below the minimum threshold required for sustenance. Imports of food and food aid were utilized to address the substantial disparity between the availability and demand for food, with the latter constituting the majority of the deficit. At this juncture, one may inquire about the definition and role of UA in the context of attaining food security [\n52\n].\nUA is considered as CSA, because it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by producing food closer to the point of consumption, thereby decreasing the carbon footprint associated with transportation and refrigeration [\n17\n,\n38\n]. Additionally, UA can help to mitigate the urban heat island effect by increasing vegetation cover in cities and reducing the need for energy-intensive cooling systems [\n47\n]. Furthermore, UA promotes sustainable practices such as rainwater harvesting and composting, which can help to build resilience to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods [\n18\n]. Overall, UA offers a sustainable and adaptive approach to food production that aligns with climate-smart principles. Due to this, UA is a climate-smart method that can be used to improve food and income security [\n13\n,\n34\n]. Furthermore, UA is becoming acknowledged as a cost-effective and efficient approach to achieving sustainable urbanization [\n4\n,\n45\n]. The notion of CSA has the potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Thorough and detailed study is essential to justify the need for both food and monetary security. In recent times, study has examined the advantages of UA in terms of its impact on food production, dietary habits, and food security [\n53\n]. A study conducted by Van Lier et al. [\n54\n] discovered a direct correlation between individuals who engage in food cultivation and their consumption of produce. These findings are corroborated by a separate study, which reveals that indicators of health and well-being not only experienced enhancement, but home gardening also offers augmented availability of reasonably priced and nourishing produce, thereby enhancing food security for the community [\n4\n,\n57\n].\nUA is being more recognized as an important component of climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices worldwide, particularly in terms of food security [\n43\n]. The importance of UA across Africa, notably Ethiopia, has grown as cities face a variety of food access and sustainability concerns. UA, as a type of CSA, is critical in encouraging nutritional or dietary diversity since it increases access to a wide range of fresh, healthy, and culturally significant foods. Supporting UA programmes allows policymakers and communities to improve urban populations' nutritional health and food security while simultaneously helping to climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Despite its expanding importance, there is a significant lack of study on the benefits of UA, particularly in the Ethiopian context as a CSA. Although some study has been conducted on UA in Ethiopia, a more comprehensive understanding of its potential benefits and limitations is required. Many studies, including Yalew [\n60\n], Nigus et al. [\n41\n], Ashebir et al. [\n7\n], and Warren et al. [\n58\n], have focused on the adoption, status, and practice of UA as CSA agriculture in many parts of Ethiopia. None of these studies have used UA as CSA agriculture and determine its adoption and effect on food security, distinguishing this finding from others.\nThis study aims to close this gap by investigating the factors of UA as CSA practices and their influence on food security in Wolaita Sodo, South Ethiopia. This study intended to contribute to the expanding body of knowledge on UA in Ethiopia by analyzing the current situation and identifying gaps in the existing literature. The study's goal is to shed light on UA's unique contribution to climate-wise agriculture and food security in Ethiopia by thoroughly evaluating current study and undertaking a thorough examination of the local context.\n2\nMethodology\n2.1\nDescription of the study area\nSodo, a township nestled in the southern reaches of Ethiopia within the Wolaita zone, lies approximately 320 km southwest of the nation's capital, Addis Ababa [\n59\n]. As the political and administrative nucleus of both the Wolaita Zone and the South Ethiopia, Sodo is positioned at latitude of 6°54′N and a longitude of 37°45′E (Fig.\n1\n). The town's elevation spans from 1,600 to 2,222 m above sea level, offering a diverse topography.\nFig. 1\nStudy area map\nFull size image\nSodo serves as the administrative hub for its namesake town and is flanked by Sodo Zuriya and Humbo Woreda to the south, Damot Gale Woreda to the north, and Damot Pulassa to the east [\n15\n]. The urban agricultural landscape of Sodo is characterized by a tapestry of livelihood systems that range from subsistence farming and processing at the household scale to more expansive commercial agricultural ventures. This agricultural mosaic is supported by a variety of production systems that foster a symbiotic relationship between vegetable, fruit, and crop cultivation, alongside livestock-rearing endeavors.\nThe region's agro-climatic conditions transition from midland to highland zones, facilitating the cultivation of an assortment of agricultural commodities [\n15\n]. These include cereal grains such as sorghum and maize,a medley of vegetables including potatoes, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, green peppers, and cabbage; a selection of fruit-bearing trees like oranges, mangoes, bananas, lemons, and papayas; as well as perennial plantings such as coffee. Additionally, the area is conducive to a range of livestock-rearing activities, encompassing dairy cattle, beef cattle fattening, goats, sheep, poultry, and apiculture.\n2.2\nStudy design\nThis study utilized a cross-sectional design to investigate the determinants of UA as CSA practices and its impact on food security in Wolaita Sodo city, South Ethiopia. The study involved collecting data at a single point in time to analyze the relationships between various factors influencing UA practices and food security. Data was collected through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data was collected through structured questionnaires administered to a sample of urban households practicing UA in Wolaita Sodo city. The questionnaire included questions on household demographics, UA practices, CSA practices, food security status, and perception of climate change. Qualitative data was collected through key informant interviews with local agricultural extension workers, government officials, and representatives from non-governmental organizations involved in promoting UA and CSA practices in the region. The interviews provided a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in implementing CSA practices in an urban setting and their impact on food security.\n2.3\nData type, sources and sampling procedure\nIn the pursuit of primary data, face-to-face interviews were conducted with participants, employing semi-structured questionnaires as the principal instrument. The study amalgamated both qualitative and quantitative data, sourced from primary and secondary channels. The primary data corpus was amassed from households engaged in urban farming as well as those not partaking in agricultural activities. Conversely, secondary data was procured from an array of institutional reports emanating from agricultural offices, unions, and cooperatives and supplemented by scholarly articles and documents in the public domain. The determination of the sample size adhered to the Cochran formula [\n14\n], calibrated to ensure a 5% margin of error and a confidence level of 95%, thereby ensuring statistical rigor and reliability in the data collection process.\n$$n_{0} = \\frac{{Z^{2} p(1 - p)}}{{e^{2} }} = n_{0} = \\frac{{Z^{2} PQ}}{{e^{2} }} = \\frac{{(1.96)^{2} *0.5*0.5}}{{(0.05)^{2} }} = 384$$\nwhere “\nZ”\nis form Z-value, “Q” is the sample size, “P” is the population's proportion, and “e” is the margin of error.\nThe proportion of adopters of UA in the sample was 206 out of 384 families, or 53.53%. Non-adopters of UA accounted for 178 of the 384 homes in the sample, or 46.47%. After ascertaining the overall population and data, the strata were classified as adopters or non-adopters of UA practice. The overall number of adopters was 206, and the total number of non-adopters was 178, out of a total sample size of 384 homes. This sampling strategy guaranteed statistical rigor and reliability in the data collection procedure.\n2.4\nMethods of data collection\nData collection methods; survey/interview, focus group discussion (FGD) were made in January up to May 2023 GC. In order to collect the primary data, semi-structured questionnaire was prepared. Besides this, it was collected by asking 6 key informants interview (KII), who have knowledge about it. The discussions included farmers who were not included in the interviews. It was a mixed FGD consisting of five to eight individuals drawn from the above-mentioned groups of people in each kebele. The secondary data were obtained by conducting an extensive review of available papers and agricultural reports in the district. Combined descriptive and econometric analysis was employed. The following is a discussion of these methods' detailed explanations.\n2.5\nMethods of data analysis\nThe socio-economic characteristics of the sample households were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including measures such as mean, minimum and maximum values, frequency, percentages, and standard deviation. The statistical tests of chi-square and t-test were employed to assess the percentage and mean disparity between individuals who adopted UA and those who did not. As stated by Amare [\n6\n], the level of food security for the sample home was evaluated by following a series of steps. The conversion factor used for Ethiopia was applied to get the total kilocalories equivalent of net food grains available per family in kilograms. Next, the food supply determined in the first phase was utilized to compute the amount of calories accessible per individual per day for every family. Subsequently, in accordance with the FDRE Food Security Strategy, a daily intake of 2,200 kcal per person was adopted as the benchmark for the amount of calories needed (i.e., demanded) to support a healthy and moderately active lifestyle for an adult. Ultimately, a comparison was conducted between the existing supply and the necessary demand for grain-based food. A household is classified as food insecure if their daily per capita calorie supply is below their demand, using a threshold of 2,200 kcal. Conversely, households with a daily per capita calorie supply over this threshold are termed food secure.\nAs a result, HFS status was evaluated using daily consumption as an adult equivalent. Ethiopia's minimum recommended allowance for food security is 2200 kcal [\n40\n]. The daily per capita household calorie intake was calculated by dividing the per capita calorie consumption by 7 days. The fourth stage entails comparing per capita per day calorie consumption to the World Health Organization's recommended daily intake of 2200 kcal per capita per day. This is provided by:\n$${\\text{HFS}}_{\\text{I}}=\\frac{TNC \\,consumed \\,by \\,household \\,in \\,one \\,day}{Adult \\,equivalent \\,size}$$\nwhere, HFS\ni\nis household food security status and TNC is the total net calories consumed by a household in one day.\n2.6\nEconometric analysis\n2.6.1\nImpact of UA on food security status of household\nThe propensity score-matching (PSM) approach is widely accepted in academic literature as a reliable technique for assessing impact assessment studies that use cross-sectional data. This approach is particularly adept at comparing households that are homogenous in all respects save for the intervention under scrutiny, as delineated by Heckman et al. [\n26\n]. In the context of this investigation, the researchers have harnessed the PSM model to discern the impact of UA on food security. The PSM technique was instrumental in matching households engaged in UA with their counterparts who do not participate in such activities, thereby establishing household food security status as the outcome variable of interest. The initial step in this process involved the estimation of the propensity score, which quantifies the probability of a household receiving the intervention, predicated upon a set of pre-treatment variables. This estimation was conducted utilizing the Logit model, a method expounded upon by Ahmed and Mesfin [\n2\n], which serves to elucidate the determinants that sway a household's decision to adopt UA practices. In this study, the average treatment effect (ATE) was ascertained by instituting a common support domain. This domain encapsulates the extremities of propensity scores from both the treatment cohort UA adopters and the control group non-adopters. The determination of ATE was facilitated by the deployment of matching algorithms, as explicated by Caliendo and Kopeinig [\n12\n]. The methodologies employed encompassed nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, and Kernel-based matching. The ATE itself is conceptualized as the divergence in mean outcomes between the cohorts who have adopted UA and those who have not, post alignment of both groups on similar characteristics as per their propensity scores.\nEach of these matching algorithms typically uses a unique bandwidth or weighting scheme. Nearest neighbor matching normally takes into account only the units in the control group that are closest to each treated unit, with no weights assigned based on distance. Radius matching, on the other hand, assigns weights according to the distance between treatment and control units within a given radius [\n11\n]. Kernel-based matching assigns weights to all control units based on their distance from the treated unit. Each matching technique may have a default bandwidth parameter or allow the user to select one [\n10\n]. Within each technique, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) can be estimated using either uniform bandwidth or adaptive bandwidth, depending on the data characteristics. The use of matching algorithms facilitates the determination of ATE by allowing for the creation of comparable treatment and control groups, resulting in a more accurate evaluation of treatment effects.\nTo fortify the integrity of the study's conclusions, a sensitivity analysis was meticulously conducted to preclude any latent biases. The crux of this analysis is to interrogate the potential sway of unobserved variables on the estimation of treatment effects, a concern highlighted by Caliendo and Kopeinig [\n12\n]. Given the inherent limitations in gauging selection bias through non-experimental data, sensitivity analysis emerges as a pivotal tool. This study engaged the Rosenbaum bounding technique [\n49\n] in its sensitivity analysis to scrutinize the outcome variables for any distortions stemming from deviations from the premise of conditional independence.\n2.6.2\nPropensity score matching (PSM)\nPSM is a popular method for evaluating causal treatment affects that is also being used to evaluate policy programmes [\n12\n]. Among the non-experimental methods, PSM was chosen since it does not require data from the baseline and is considered the second-best way after experimental design to reduce selection biases. PSM selects a group that shares the same observable characteristics as intervention participants [\n8\n]. This is done by estimating the statistical model of participation probability (propensity score) using a binary regression model in which treatment status is regressed on observed baseline parameters that cannot be modified by intervention.\nThis estimated propensity score represents the model's expected probability of treatment, and treatment groups are matched with non-treatment groups based on similar propensity scores [\n8\n]. The matching method uses statistical tools to assess the treatment effects of a closed comparison group with observable data [\n9\n]. Matching is the greatest quasi-experimental design strategy since it allows you to identify a set of control groups that appear the most like the treatment group [\n8\n,\n9\n].\nIn this study, the PSM model was used to determine the farming effect of UA as CSA on household food security in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia. It provides a means of ensuring comparability between households that have chosen to cultivate UA as CSA and those that have not. PSM allows researchers to adjust for potential confounding variables that may influence UA as CSA decisions and family food security outcomes. This enables a more precise evaluation of the causal effect of UA as CSA on household food security, ultimately assisting policymakers and stakeholders in making informed decisions about expanding UA as CSA farming as a means of improving regional food security.\nThe initial step in estimating the treatment effect involves calculating the propensity score, which can be derived using conventional probability models such as logit or probit [\n39\n]. Since the likelihood of participation is unknown, estimating it is the first step in the matching process. The choice of decision model should be appropriate for the case under review. For programs offering a single treatment, the propensity score can be typically calculated using a probit or logit model, where 'participation' serves as the dependent variable and the independent variables are those factors presumed to influence both participation and outcome. Following Pindyck and Rubinfeld [\n46\n], the cumulative logistic probability function is specified as:\n$${\\text{P}}_{{\\text{i}}} = {\\text{F(Z}}_{{\\text{i}}} ) = {\\text{F}}\\left[ {\\alpha + \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{m} {\\beta _{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{X}}_{{\\text{i}}} } } \\right] = \\frac{1}{{{\\text{1 + e}}}} - \\left[ {\\alpha + \\sum\\nolimits_{i}^{m} {\\beta _{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{X}}_{{\\text{i}}} } } \\right]$$\n(1)\nwhere, e- represents the base of natural logarithms (2.718…).\nX\ni\n-represents the i\nth\nexplanatory variable.\nP\ni\n- the probability that an individual participates in the UA as CSA production.\nα and β\ni\nare parameters to be estimated.\nInterpreting the coefficients becomes more straightforward if the logistic model is expressed in terms of odds and the log of odds [\n25\n]. The odds ratio represents the ratio of the probability that an individual participated (P\ni\n) to the probability that they did not participate (1-P\ni\n).The probability that he/she was not be a participant is defined by:\n$$\\left[ {1 - {\\text{pi}}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{{1 + e}}Z_{i}$$\n(2)\nUsing Eqs. (\n1\n) and (\n2\n), the odds ratio becomes\n$$\\frac{{pi}}{{1 - pi}} = 1 + {\\text{e}}^{{{\\text{Zi}}}} /1 + {\\text{ e }} - ^{{{\\text{Z i}}}} = {\\text{e}}^{{{\\text{Z I}}}}$$\n(3)\nAlternatively,\n$$\\frac{{Pi}}{{1 - pi}} = 1 + e^{{Zi}} /1 + e - ^{{Zi}} = e^{{\\left[ {\\alpha + pt\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{m} {\\beta ^{I} pt^{{Xi}} } } \\right]}}$$\n(4)\nTaking the natural logarithms of Eq. (\n4\n) given the logit model as indicated below.\n$${\\text{Z}}_{{\\text{i}}} = {\\text{ Ln}}\\,\\frac{pi}{{1 - pi}} \\, = \\, \\alpha \\, + \\, \\beta_{{1}} {\\text{X}}_{{1}} + \\, \\beta_{{2}} {\\text{X}}_{{2}} + \\, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots . + \\, \\beta_{{\\text{n}}} {\\text{X}}_{{{\\text{ni}}}} + {\\text{U}}_{{\\text{i}}}$$\n(5)\nAfter deriving the predicted probability values conditional on the observable covariates (the propensity scores) from the binary estimation, matching was performed using a matching algorithm chosen according to the characteristics of the data. Thus (\nY\n) is specified as:\n$$\\tau \\, = {\\text{ Y}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\left( {{\\text{D}}_{{\\text{i}}} = { 1}} \\right) \\, {-}{\\text{ Y}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\left( {{\\text{D}}_{{\\text{i}}} = \\, 0} \\right)$$\n(6)\nwhere τ represents the treatment effect (the effect of participation in UA as CSA),\nY\ni\ndenotes the outcome for household i, and\nD\ni\nindicates whether household i received the treatment (i.e., participated in UA as CSA).\nIt is important to note that Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 1) and Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 0) cannot be simultaneously observed for the same household. Depending on the household's treatment status (participation in UA as CSA), either Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 1) or Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 0) will be an unobserved outcome, referred to as the counterfactual outcome. Consequently, estimating the individual treatment effect τi is not feasible, necessitating a shift to estimating average treatment effects at the population level rather than the individual level. The most commonly used average treatment effect estimation is the 'average treatment effect on the treated (τATT),' specified as follows.\n$$\\tau {\\text{ATT }} = {\\text{ E}}(\\tau /{\\text{D }} = 1) = {\\text{ E}}\\left[ {{\\text{Y}}_{\\left( 1 \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 1 - {\\text{E}}{\\text{Y}}_{\\left( {\\text{O}} \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 1} \\right]$$\n(7)\nSince the counterfactual mean for those receiving the treatment, (E[Y(1) | D = 1]), is unobserved, an appropriate substitute must be chosen to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). One might consider using the mean outcome of the untreated individuals, (E[Y(0) | D = 0]), as a proxy for the counterfactual mean for those being treated, (E[Y(0) | D = 1]). However, this approach is flawed, particularly in non-experimental studies, because the factors influencing the treatment decision are likely to also affect the outcome variable. In this specific context, the variables influencing households’ decisions to participate in UA as CSA participants could also affect input use intensity, productivity levels, farmers’ income, and consequently, food security status. Therefore, the outcomes for individuals in the treatment and comparison groups would differ even in the absence of treatment, leading to self-selection bias. By rearranging and subtracting (E[Y(0) | D = 0]) from both sides, one can derive the following specification for:\n$${\\text{ATT}}.{\\text{E}}\\left[ {{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}_{\\left( 1 \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 1 - {\\text{ E}}\\left( {{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}_{ \\left( 0 \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 0} \\right)} \\right] = \\tau {\\text{ATT}} - {\\text{ E}}\\left[ {{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}-{\\left( 1 \\right)}{\\text{ }}/{\\text{D}}\\,{\\text{ = 1}} - {\\text{E}}{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}_{\\left( 0 \\right)}/{\\text{D}} = 0} \\right]$$\n(8)\nBoth terms on the left-hand side are observables, and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) can be identified if and only if (E[Y(0) \\mid D = 0]—E[Y(0) \\mid D = 1] = 0), indicating an absence of self-selection bias. This condition is met exclusively in social experiments where treatments are randomly assigned to units, thereby eliminating self-selection bias. In non-experimental studies, however, it is necessary to introduce certain identifying assumptions to address the selection problem.\n2.7\nDefinition of variables\nUA adoption is the Logit model dependent variable. Food security from UA practice is the outcome. Previous study and study conditions determine independent variables. Age, gender, education, employment status, household monthly income, family size, land size, perception of UA, credit access, training and support, home ownership, market demand, and household location are independent variables.\n2.7.1\nDependent variable\nUA practice: This study treated it as a dummy variable, giving it a value of “1” for “adopters” and “0” for “non-adopters”.\n2.7.2\nOutcome variables\nFood security is another dummy variable with values of 1 for secure and 0 for insecure. Intake is determined by calories (food consumption recall survey module/food diary). Independent variables.\nAge of the household head (AGHH)\n: The variable is continuous and measured in years. Based on prior research, this characteristic may positively or negatively affect UA adoption as CSA [\n30\n]. Younger/older farmers may be less inclined to embrace UA because to a lack of information. If the family head is within the productive age, the variable should boost UA adoption.\nCredit access (CRAC)\n: A dummy variable, it represents 1 if the household has credit and 0 otherwise. If they have financing, farmers can participate in UA, whereas others without it may struggle to accept technology [\n37\n].\nEducational status of household head (EDHH)\n: This continuous variable measures years of schooling. Adopters' household heads had more years of schooling than non-adopters, which helped them understand the relevance of UA practices [\n41\n]. Education is considered to make UA adoption more likely, but illiteracy reduces adoption due to a lack of understanding or awareness. Thus, this variable may effect adoption. According to Ibrahim et al. [\n29\n], household education drives UA adoption.\nFamily size (FAMSZ)\n: Family size is a continuous variable. According to various studies [\n20\n,\n30\n] household size can affect technology adoption. UA is more likely to be pursued by larger households [\n30\n]. This may be due to family help, which may boost UA adoption.\nHousehold Location (HHLO\n): Location of the household is a categorical variable evaluated by HH location differences. The model presents ρ\n1\nfor households not near the market, ρ\n2\nfor moderate fare households, ρ\n3\nfor near households, and ρ\n4\nfor in-market families. Regional differences can affect farmer adoption [\n35\n].\nJob status of household head (JSHH)\n: The dummy variable 0 represents job seekers and 1 represents employed people. In this sense, \"job\" means a salaried position where a person does tasks for money. A \"job seeker\" is an unemployed person actively seeking work. This term applies regardless of employment market or geography. This characteristic may hinder UA uptake [\n21\n]. Because households with other income-generating jobs are less likely to undertake UA practices, thus, it may negatively impact UA engagement.\nLand size (LASZ)\n: This continuous variable, measured in hectares, has a positive link with UA adoption. Increasing land size improves the likelihood of UA. This is because households with vast plots of land can practice any UA. Hu et al. [\n28\n] found that land size boosts agricultural technology adoption. Therefore, this variable should positively and significantly affect UA uptake.\nMarket demand (MKTDD)\n: A dummy variable with one if they assume increased agricultural product demand and zero otherwise. UA attracts farmers due to rising demand [\n24\n]. Thus, rising market demand may boost engagement.\nMonthly income of the household (MOINHH)\n: Continuous variable measured in Ethiopian birr. Urban agricultural engagement is projected to decrease significantly with this variable. The negative effects of this variable are due to the fact that households with higher monthly incomes are less likely to farm in urban areas.\nOwnership of living home (OWLHO)\n: This dummy variable is 1 if the household owns a home and 0 otherwise. Homeownership improves household well-being and adoption [\n50\n].\nHousehold perception of urban agriculture (PHUA)\n: It is a dummy variable that assumes one if UA reduces purchase costs (UA benefits) and zero otherwise. Thus, positive perception of UA may increase engagement. UA can be improved by promoting healthy eating and reducing food costs [\n24\n].\nGender of household head (GEHH)\n: This variable is binary, indicating whether the household head is male or female. One element affecting new product uptake is gender. Men have more opportunity to leave home and participate in developmental programmes than women, so they can learn more about technology. Female urban farmers predominate [\n30\n]. This study hypothesizes that male farmers are more likely to practice UA.\nTraining and support (TRSU)\n: A continuous variable measuring the number of government and NGO training and support for UA for the HH. Training helps households adopt technology. Training and support should increase engagement, according to the hypothesis.\n3\nResult\n3.1\nSocio demographic and economic characteristics of sample households\nThe findings showed that 53.53% of the 384 sample homes' respondents were engaging in UA, whereas the remaining 46.47% respondents were not (Table\n1\n). The various factors influencing the acceptance of UA as CSA were succinctly summarized in the accompanying table. Tables\n1\nand\n2\nshow the results of a comparison between those who adopted and did not embrace UA as CSA by using the chi-square-test (for dummy variables) and the t-test (for continuous variables). The statistical analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in mean values between individuals who adopted and those who did not adopt, specifically in relation to job position, perception towards UA, and family size. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean values of the remaining variables between individuals who adopted and those who did not adopt.\nTable 1 Dummy variables pertaining to sample homes' socio-demographic characteristics\nFull size table\nTable 2 Continuous variables pertaining to sample families' socio-demographic and economic characteristics\nFull size table\nJob status is among the most important determining factors for participating in UA. The survey result showed that 37.05% of the total sample households had paying jobs. From sample households having paying jobs, 17.05% of them were practicing UA while the remaining 20% were not practicing UA (Table\n2\n). The survey result indicated that 22.3% sample households believed UA can reduce the cost of buying whereas the remaining of them was not (Table\n2\n). Family size is the most important labor inputs for every farming activity and the survey result indicated the average family size of sample households who adopt the UA was 4.6 while 4 for non-adopters (Table\n2\n).\n3.2\nEconometric analysis\n3.2.1\nFactors affecting the adoption of UA\nThe logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the likelihood ratio test was highly significant at the 1% level (\np\n≤ 0.005), suggesting that the independent variables possess robust explanatory capabilities regarding the determinants influencing the uptake of UA, as evidenced by the model's goodness of fit. The empirical outcomes of the model elucidated that variables such as household size, homeownership status, employment status of the household head, perceptions of UA, market demand, and the presence of training and support from government or non-governmental organizations exert a statistically significant impact on the propensity to adopt urban agricultural practices, as detailed in Table\n3\n.\nTable 3 Logistic regression result on the determinants of UA practices as CSA\nFull size table\n3.2.2\nImpact of urban agriculture on food security\nThe investigation employed PSM to ascertain the influence of urban agriculture implementation on the food security status of the sampled households. The study meticulously computed the propensity scores, selected an appropriate matching algorithm, and conducted a thorough balance check to ensure comparability between the treated and control groups. Subsequently, the study rigorously assessed the impact of urban agriculture on food security, thereby providing empirical insights into its effectiveness.\n3.3\nPropensity score estimation\nThe propensity scores were estimated using a logit model, taking into account the fitness for estimation and careful evaluation of the assumptions of PSM. The estimated propensity score (PS) was used to establish the common support region, which was determined by statistical study of those who adopted urban agriculture and those who did not. The common support zone was identified by selecting the lowest value among the highest scores and the highest value among the lowest scores for the propensity scores of both groups. The common support region ranged from 0.042 (the lowest maximum value) to 0.991(the highest minimum value) of the propensity score (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n1\n). Hence, 58 observations (consisting of 35 adopters and 23 non-adopters) were removed from the impact analysis sections due to the overlap requirement.\nIn the quest to discern the treatment's impact, post-estimation of propensity scores, the treated group's values were juxtaposed with those of the control group members exhibiting analogous propensity scores. The matching methodology encompassed a spectrum of techniques, including nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, and kernel matching. The selection of the superior matching algorithm was predicated on several criteria; the mean bias, the tally of matched observations, the count of balanced covariates, and the magnitude of the pseudo\nR\n-squared. An optimal match is characterized by the minimal mean standardized bias, the most reduced pseudo\nR\n-squared, a comparable number of matched observations, an equivalent count of balanced covariates relative to alternative algorithms, a substantial overall bias diminution, and non-significant\np\n-values in the likelihood ratio test subsequent to matching. Hence, researcher computed the mean bias, the quantity of matched observations, the number of balanced variables, and the pseudo\nR\n-squared value (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n2\n). Employing these metrics, nearest neighbor matching emerged as the paramount technique for aligning the treatment units (adopters) with the control group (non-adopters), thereby facilitating the evaluation of urban agriculture adoption's ramifications via PSM.\nUpon the completion of the matching procedure, the matched units within the adopter and non-adopter cohorts were rendered statistically indistinguishable. The t-test was utilized to compare the means of all variables included in the propensity score, thereby evaluating the mean equivalence between the two cohorts (adopters and non-adopters). The analysis indicated that the mean difference for any given covariate between the cohorts was less than 25%, with the overall absolute mean bias registering at 3.1%, comfortably within the acceptable range of 2 to 5%. The exhaustive balancing test substantiated the absence of significant differences in the variables post-matching, corroborated by the non-significant results in the chi-squared test (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n3\n), thereby affirming the methodological soundness of the matching process.\n3.4\nEstimation of average treatment effect\nAfter balance verification, the average treatment effect (ATE) was calculated by averaging the result discrepancies between each treated (adoption) unit and its control (non-adoption) group. It was interpreted as how urban agriculture affects food security. The ATE's influence on adopters was assessed using nearest neighbor matching. A bootstrapping method with 100 replications was used to estimate matching estimator standard errors, which adjust for the calculated propensity score.\nResults show no change in the impact of urban agriculture, even with treatment chances varying up to eγ = 2.5. The predicted outcome variable has significant p-values at different values of the threshold value of eγ (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n4\n). This suggests that the study considered relevant factors that affected participation and outcome variables. Therefore, this study's outcome variable impact estimates (ATT) were not subject to unobserved selection bias.\nTable 4 Impact of adopting urban agriculture on household food security\nFull size table\n4\nDiscussion\n4.1\nDescriptive results discussion\nEmployment status emerges as a pivotal determinant in the engagement with urban agriculture. The data reveals that a majority of the surveyed households, approximately 63%, were without paid employment. This indicates a high level of unemployment or underemployment within the community. Among these households, 36.47% were found to have adopted urban agriculture as a form of climate-smart agriculture, compared to 26.47% who did not engage in urban agriculture. This suggests that there is a higher propensity for urban agriculture adoption among households lacking formal employment.\nOne possible reason for this trend could be the economic benefits that urban agriculture can provide for households without paid employment. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, urban agriculture can serve as a source of income and food security for families who may struggle to find formal employment opportunities. By growing their own food and selling surplus produce, households can supplement their income and improve their economic situation. Additionally, urban agriculture can provide a sense of empowerment and self-sufficiency for households without paid employment. By growing their own food and taking control of their food production, households can reduce their dependence on external sources for food and resources. This can lead to increased resilience in the face of economic challenges and fluctuations.\nThe statistically significant difference observed at the 5% level between urban agriculture adopters and non-adopters in terms of job status further supports the idea that households lacking formal employment are more likely to engage in urban agriculture. This finding aligns with previous study by Ofordu et al. [\n44\n], which found that a substantial proportion of urban farmers were either self-employed or apprentices. This suggests a growing trend towards urban agriculture among individuals outside of the formal employment sector.\nOverall, the data indicates that urban agriculture can serve as a valuable and sustainable livelihood option for households without paid employment. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, by adopting urban agriculture as a form of climate-smart agriculture, these households can improve their economic situation, food security, and overall resilience in the face of economic challenges.\nPerception of UA as a CSA can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, urban agriculture can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By producing food locally and reducing the need for long-distance transportation, urban agriculture can help lower carbon emissions associated with food production and distribution.\nAdditionally, urban agriculture can contribute to climate change adaptation by providing a source of local, resilient food production. In times of extreme weather events or disruption in global food supply chains, urban agriculture can serve as a valuable resource for communities to access fresh, locally grown produce. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, urban agriculture can act as a cost-reduction strategy for households by providing access to affordable, fresh produce. By growing their own food in urban spaces, households can save money on grocery bills and reduce their reliance on expensive, processed foods.\nThe significant differences in perception towards urban agriculture as a CSA between adopters and non-adopters could be due to a variety of reasons. Adopters may have had firsthand experience with the benefits of urban agriculture, such as cost savings and access to fresh produce, leading to a more positive perception of its role as a climate-smart agriculture. Non-adopters, on the other hand, may have preconceived notions about urban agriculture as a less effective or sustainable form of food production. The evolution of urban agriculture from traditional backyard farming to a more structured and professional domain is a positive development. This shift not only enhances the credibility and viability of urban agriculture as a sustainable food production system but also aligns with broader community enhancement and environmental greening initiatives. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, by integrating urban agriculture into urban planning and development strategies, cities can harness its potential to improve food security, promote sustainable practices, and enhance community resilience.\nThe recognition of urban agriculture as a CSA and cost-reduction strategy reflects the growing significance of this practice in addressing key societal challenges, such as food insecurity and climate change. By continuing to support and promote urban agriculture initiatives, policymakers, researchers, and communities can leverage its potential to create more resilient, sustainable, and equitable food systems in urban areas.\nFurthermore, the analysis indicated a higher likelihood of urban agriculture adoption in households with larger family sizes. The mean family size difference between adopters and non-adopters was statistically significant at the 5% level, with the average household comprising 5.7 individuals. The finding that households with larger family sizes are more likely to adopt urban agriculture as a CSA practice can be attributed to several reasons. First, in larger families, there is likely a greater need for food production to feed all family members. Urban agriculture can provide a source of fresh fruits and vegetables that supplement the household's food supply, potentially reducing food insecurity. Additionally, larger families may have more hands available to help with the labor-intensive activities associated with urban agriculture, such as planting, watering, and harvesting crops. This can contribute to higher adoption rates among households with larger family sizes.\nThe observation that urban agriculture practices are more prevalent among smaller families can be explained by the time commitments associated with urban agriculture. Larger families often have more responsibilities, such as childcare, that require a significant amount of time and attention. As a result, the labor availability for urban agriculture activities may be limited in larger families, leading to lower adoption rates. Smaller families, on the other hand, may have more flexibility and time to dedicate to urban agriculture practices, making them more likely to adopt these sustainable agricultural practices.\nThe findings from this analysis have important implications for designing effective policies and programs to promote urban agriculture adoption as a CSA practice. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, policymakers and program implementers should consider the size of the household when developing strategies to promote urban agriculture, as larger families may require additional support and resources to overcome barriers to adoption. Additionally, efforts to promote urban agriculture among smaller families should focus on highlighting the potential time savings and benefits of engaging in these practices, to encourage greater uptake among this demographic. Overall, understanding the relationship between family size and urban agriculture adoption can help inform targeted interventions to promote sustainable agriculture practices in urban settings. This is consistent with Nigus et al. [\n41\n], who reported average family sizes of 5.54 for adopters and 6.06 for non-adopters. Interestingly, urban agriculture practices were more prevalent among smaller families, a finding significant at the 1% level. This may be attributable to the time commitments associated with urban agriculture,larger families often allocate more time to childcare, potentially compromising the labor availability for urban agriculture activities.\n4.2\nDiscussion of the factors affecting the adoption of urban agriculture\nFamily size\nNumber of household members positively and significantly affects urban agriculture participation as climate smart agriculture (CSA). This indicates that urban agriculture is more common in households with more people. The study found that if a household adds one person, the odds ratio for urban agriculture increases by 0.38 units, holding other variables constant. This shows that larger households are more likely to farm urban.\nDanso-Abbeam et al. [\n16\n] also discovered a favorable association between household size and organic cotton adoption. Other study conducted Ida Naziera et al. [\n30\n] discovered that urban residents with larger households are more likely to consider urban agriculture. Due to more family members helping out, larger households can better manage and maintain urban agriculture methods. The number of household members affects the chance of climate-smart urban agriculture. Family support makes larger households more likely to participate in urban agriculture.\nOwnership of living home\n: A 10% significance level was found for home ownership in defining urban agriculture as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). When other variables are held equal, households with their own living residence are 0.71 times more likely to adopt CSA varieties. This supports Kaliba et al. [\n33\n], who reported a positive correlation between home ownership and technology adoption. According to  Zeng et al. [\n61\n], home ownership improves household well-being and technology adoption. Ownership of a living home may bring stability and security, making people more likely to participate in urban agriculture. Owning a home can encourage sustainable behaviors like CSA and improve household welfare and community resilience.\nJob status of HH head\n: The occupational position of the household head negatively impacted the adoption of climate-smart urban agriculture. The likelihood of urban agriculture adoption decreased by 0.95 for those with their own residences. This contradicts Ibrahim et al. [\n29\n], who showed a positive and substantial effect of work status on urban agriculture practices. This may be because households with other income-generating jobs have less time for urban agriculture. Job seekers may also turn to urban agriculture for cash. Governments often use urban agriculture to create jobs.\nPerception toward urban agriculture\n: At 1% significance level, this variable proved important in defining urban agriculture as CSA practices. Households that consider urban agriculture can cut buying costs are 1.74 times more likely to adopt these types, assuming other variables remain constant. Ida Naziera et al. [\n30\n] discovered that urban agriculture reduces fresh food costs and promotes healthy eating.\nMarket demand\n: Market demand was found to be major variables in urban agriculture CSA adoption at 10% level, with an odd ratio in favour of adoption greater by 0.82 for households that predict a growing demand for agricultural products. Urban agriculture attracts farmers due to rising demand [\n24\n].\nTraining and support\n: This variable significantly affected urban agriculture CSA decision-making at 1% significance level. Keeping other variables equal, the odds ratio in favour of urban agriculture would improve by 0.35 if the household received one more training and support. Training helps households adopt technology.\nTraining and support are crucial factors in promoting the adoption of urban agriculture as climate-smart agriculture. The findings suggest that when individuals receive training and support, they are more likely to engage in urban agriculture practices. This highlights the importance of providing education and assistance to households to help them understand the benefits of urban agriculture and how to implement it effectively.\nTraining can provide households with the knowledge and skills needed to successfully practice urban agriculture, including techniques for sustainable farming and climate-smart practices [\n42\n]. Support, on the other hand, can provide resources, guidance, and encouragement to help households overcome challenges and effectively implement urban agriculture practices.\nThe significant relationship between training and support and the decision to practice urban agriculture underscores the importance of investing in educational programs and resources for individuals interested in urban agriculture. By providing training and support, policymakers and organizations can help increase awareness, build capacity, and facilitate the adoption of CSA practices in urban areas.\nOverall, training and support play a critical role in promoting the adoption of urban agriculture as a sustainable and environmentally friendly practice. By investing in education and assistance for households, we can help create a more resilient and climate-smart agricultural system in urban areas.\n4.3\nDiscussion of impact of urban agriculture on food security\nAccording to the results, at a 1% significance level, the average treatment effect on the treated was noteworthy. This suggests that the implementation of urban agriculture has a significant effect on food security. Specifically, if farmers engage in urban agriculture, the probability of achieving food security would improve by a factor of 0.685, all other factors remaining constant.\nThere are several reasons why the adoption of urban agriculture as climate smart agriculture can have a significant impact on food security. Urban agriculture allows for the production of a variety of crops in smaller spaces, providing a more diverse range of food options for residents. This can help to address issues of food insecurity by ensuring a steady and diverse supply of fresh produce. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, climate smart agriculture practices, such as water conservation and soil management techniques, can help urban farmers adapt to changing weather patterns and extreme weather events. This can help to ensure a more reliable food supply, even in the face of climate-related challenges.\nUrban agriculture can reduce the distance food needs to travel from farm to plate, resulting in fresher and more nutritious produce for urban residents. This can help to improve dietary quality and overall health, contributing to food security. Urban agriculture can provide opportunities for income generation and employment for urban residents, particularly in low-income communities. This can help to alleviate poverty and improve food security by increasing access to nutritious foods. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, the adoption of urban agriculture as climate smart agriculture can have far-reaching benefits for food security, by improving access to fresh and diverse foods, increasing resilience to climate change, and creating economic opportunities for urban residents.\nA study conducted in Malaysia by Ida Naziera [\n30\n] demonstrated that engaging in urban agriculture can establish a robust and compelling basis for Malaysians to mitigate the effects of food scarcity and climate change. The outcome is consistent with the discoveries of Jaleta et al. [\n31\n]. Furthermore, the implementation of urban agriculture had notable impacts on the participants' livelihoods, specifically in terms of enhancing their standard of living and promoting a more efficient saving behavior [\n4\n]. In order to check to what extent the study was free from bias resulting from unobserved variable sensitivity analysis was undertaken.\n5\nConclusion and recommendation\nThe descriptive analysis showed that about 53.53% of the respondents were adopters’ urban agriculture. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the importance of urban agriculture as a climate-smart agricultural practice in enhancing food security in Wolaita Sodo city, South Ethiopia. The results demonstrate that UA adoption is influenced by various factors such as family size, home ownership, household head's occupation, perceptions of UA, market demand, and access to training and support. Moreover, the study reveals that UA significantly contributes to improving food security, with adopters being more likely to achieve food security compared to non-adopters. It is imperative for local authorities to implement educational programs and provide support to cooperative entities to promote the adoption of UA and combat food insecurity in urban areas. Overall, urban agriculture emerges as a promising solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure sustainable food production for urban populations.\nTherefore, the government should do a lot to engage the job seeker in to urban agriculture by providing training improve their perception and entrepreneur skill. Urban consumers, especially poor consumers, should be able to make refined decisions about food production, processing, storage, preparation, and distribution in order to make the best possible choices. Beside, policymakers should be aware of the advantages of UA. The demands and advantages of UA should be taken into consideration when physical planning (land tenure, water availability, drainage, etc.) is done.\n6\nLimitation of the study and direction for future research\nLimitations of this study include the reliance on a cross-sectional study design, which may limit the ability to establish causality between urban agriculture adoption and food security outcomes. Additionally, the study was conducted in a specific geographic area, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other locations. Furthermore, the study focused on the perceptions of UA adopters and non-adopters, but did not delve into the perspectives of other stakeholders such as government officials, agricultural experts, or community members.\nDirections for future study could include longitudinal studies to explore the long-term impact of urban agriculture on food security outcomes. Comparative studies could also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of different UA practices in diverse urban settings. Additionally, study could investigate the potential role of policies and programs in promoting climate-smart agricultural practices such as UA. Lastly, qualitative study methods could be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the motivations and obstacles faced by individuals and households in adopting UA practices. The study also suggested the adoption of inter- and Trans disciplinary study strategies, and a critical approach to urban agriculture practices. In addition to promoting practitioner-researcher collaboration, it is important to aid urban farmers in their efforts to continue producing safe, nutrient-rich goods for both personal consumption and city markets. Ultimately, sustainable assessment of urban agriculture may be a preprint to support agriculture in urban and peri-urban spaces.\nData availability\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nCode availability\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbduselam Abdulahi M.

Achieving food security is critical, as it directly impacts not only individual survival, but also societal progresses. It encompasses basic dimensions namely, availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability, which are constrained by multiple determinants. When communities or individuals lack food security, it hampers their ability to thrive and fully develop [\n2\n] [\n3\n]. Food insecurity arises whenever economic and physical access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food becomes unreliable [\n4\n] [\n5\n]. Projections show that approximately 9.9% of the global population experienced food insecurity in 2020, and this figure is expected to rise in the future [\n6\n] and [\n7\n]. The world's urban population grew by 1.84% annually between 2015 and 2020, and is expected to expand by 1.63% annually between 2020 and 2025. It was estimated that 54% of the world's population lived in urban regions in 2016; by 2030, this figure is expected to rise to 60% [\n8\n]. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs projects that from 55% in 2018, 68% of people on earth will live in urban areas by 2050. According to UN DESA [\n9\n], this suggests that nearly two out of every three people reside in urban settings. By the same year, an additional 2.5 billion people are predicted to live in urban areas due to increased urbanization, with about 90% of this growth taking place in Asia and Africa. This means that it will have a big impact on urban food insecurity because of the rapid increase in urban population, leading to food insecurity in cities [\n1\n], [\n10\n].\nRapid growth of urban populations often leads to stressed food systems. This stress arises from various interactions between people and the environment which affect food security throughout all stages of food production and consumption [\n1\n]. Urban populations typically rely heavily on purchasing food from markets rather than producing it themselves. While some urban households engage in small-scale food production through activities like backyard gardening or rooftop farming, these contributions are often modest compared to the overall food needs of the household [\n11\n]. Urban households that rely heavily on purchasing food are indeed vulnerable to food price shocks, particularly those that impacting low-income urban populations. For those living in poverty, who often spend a large percentage of their income on food, even small fluctuations in prices can have significant consequences, potentially leading to food insecurity and malnutrition. Despite ongoing urbanization across the African continent, investigations into the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged urban households to food insecurity have not received the same level of attention as those in rural areas. [\n12\n]. Yet, the urgency of addressing food security in urban areas is growing as the population of these places’ increases.\nSimilarly, the food security issue is indeed a significant challenge for economically poor and low-income households in the urban and rural areas of Ethiopia. However, advocacy and policies on food security have traditionally focused more on rural areas [\n13\n] and [\n14\n]. Today, several pieces of evidence show that urban food insecurity is a growing problem that requires dedicated attention and approach [\n15\n]. Ethiopia’s government has implemented various programs related to food security, such as the Urban Productive Safety Net Program, considering it as one of the major development problems of the country. The challenge in small towns up to the big cities of the country, and in the study area in particular, is immense. This is because of the complex nature of food security and the need for clear identification of prevailing impediments [\n16\n]. On the other hand, there is a longstanding conceptualization of urban centers as more developed and homogeneous areas [\n17\n].\nEthiopia has the fastest annual urbanization rate (4.5%), exceeding the average sub-Saharan Africa of 4% [\n18\n]. The population projections for Ethiopia show that the urban population will more than double in the next 20 years, reaching 42.4 million by 2037. This is because rural villages are upgraded to towns, and increasing migration to new urban centers can lead to unexpected food shortage issues [\n19\n]. Inquiries show that in Ethiopia, two out of five households are food-deficient, with little difference between urban and rural areas [\n20\n]. In addition, three of the four households experienced food insecurity among the urban populations [\n21\n]. Despite the sociocultural, economic, and ecological diversity of Ethiopian cities, along with the variability in day-to-day food costs and conditional differences among urban communities, there is little attention from the researchers on the issue of food security in urban settings. In line with this, studies such as those by [\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n], have focused on rural areas with little understanding of urban settings. Such rural-oriented studies have not examined the underlying causes of household susceptibility to food insecurity in an urban context. On the other hand, studies have been conducted on vulnerability to food insecurity in major Ethiopian cities such as Addis Ababa, Gondar, and Bahir Dar [\n14\n,\n15\n,\n29\n] among others. However, the inquiries were limited in scope to particular geographic areas within the country and did not comprehensively cover towns in southern Ethiopia.\nIn the urban oriented studies of the Wolaita zone, the studies by Tadesse et al. [\n30\n] and Samuel et al. [\n31\n], conducted in Sodo and Areka towns in southern Ethiopia, have aimed to analyze urban food security issues. However, they were conducted approximately ten years ago. Therefore, it does not reflect current urban development, the economic landscape, or prevailing levels of food insecurity, and do not consider the vulnerable groups of urban households. To solve the problem, which has been increasing from time to time, a scientific study considering the current situation was found to be necessary. Thus, this study aimed to answer the questions: (1) Currently what empirical evidence can be provided on the vulnerability of urban households to food insecurity? (2) What is the level of vulnerability to food insecurity? (3) What are the factors influencing the vulnerability of households in the study areas to food insecurity? Finally, this research is structured into introduction, review of relevant literature, detailing the materials and methods, presenting results, discussions, limitation, concluding with policy recommendations, and areas for further studies.\n2\nReview literature\n2.1\nApproaches and conceptualizing vulnerability to food insecurity\nVulnerability is defined as the diminished capacity of individuals or communities to anticipate and withstand the impact of both natural and man-made hazards [\n32\n]. Food vulnerability arises when shocks related to food put pressure on a household's capacity to obtain food that is both safe and nutritious [\n33\n]. This pressure originates from the interactions of biophysical and socioeconomic systems operating at various levels, impacting the household. Two approaches- outcome vulnerability and contextual vulnerability, can be explored to understand these systems. The approach of outcome vulnerability has taken into consideration, especially in recent times, the growing interest in analyzing outcomes related to climate change. It primarily concerns biophysical changes in a closed system with a boundary between nature and society [\n34\n]. As a result, the role of socioeconomic components in ameliorating the effect of risk was not explicitly included. The approach is dependent on reliable panel data. However, according to [\n35\n] and [\n36\n], panel data is frequently unavailable in many developing countries, and even when accessible, it often lacks representativeness of cross-sectional components, reducing its usefulness for policy analyses. In contrast, a contextual vulnerability perspective involves an exploration of various factors influencing the socio-economic and ecological systems. It necessitates that researchers embrace a multidisciplinary approach. Contextual vulnerability utilizes cross-sectional data to evaluate socioeconomic factors that contribute to vulnerability. This encompasses aspects such as social marginalization, economic inequality, accessibility of household food and resources, efficacy of local support institutions, and the prevailing economic and political systems. This approach identifies social groups that are more prone to food insecurity, rendering it highly pertinent to conceptually underpin the development of a comprehensive vulnerability index for food insecurity.\n2.2\nHousehold vulnerability to food insecurity\nHousehold vulnerability to food insecurity can be understood as its exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Fig.\n1\n). Exposure pertains to shocks related to food that affect a household's ability to access safe and nutritious food. It is broadly defined as the extent to which a system is exposed to the risk or impact of such shocks [\n37\n]. These shocks, when they occur, have varying effects on different levels of the system. Food-related shocks threaten household food availability. For instance, health problems can threaten a reduced ability to work and earn income, further exacerbating food insecurity [\n38\n] [\n39\n]. Households facing food-related shocks utilize their resources and implement various measures to mitigate losses and enhance their overall food security. Viewing this from a vulnerability standpoint, a household's ability to respond is referred to as its adaptive capacity, which includes the social and technical skills and tactics used by individuals and communities to cope with environmental and socioeconomic shifts. In the sphere of food systems, adaptive capacity is often utilized to maintain livelihoods, sustain food production, or ensure access to food [\n40\n]. The concept of adaptive capacity is generally recognized as a favorable characteristic in reducing the vulnerability of a system. A household with high adaptive capacity stands a stronger chance of effectively coping with food vulnerability [\n41\n]. Households that face ongoing shocks often rely on their assets to deal with the resulting stress. If their resources are insufficient, they may resort to extreme coping strategies, leading to fluctuating levels of food insecurity over time. In terms of food security, these recurring episodes can be seen as a measure of food resilience, and in discussions about vulnerability, this is known as susceptibility [\n42\n]. In this setting, sensitivity is characterized as the fundamental vulnerability of a household to address food-related shocks. The reaction of a household to such an event result in various impacts along the range of food vulnerability. These outcomes can be utilized to classify households into different categories based on their level of vulnerability to food insecurity: those that are not vulnerable, moderately vulnerable households, and highly vulnerable households [\n43\n]. Therefore, we concluded that applying a contextual perspective on vulnerability and utilizing the framework of vulnerability to food insecurity as determined by exposure indicators, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity (see Fig.\n1\n).\nFig. 1\nSource: Created by the authors, 2023\nConceptual framework of vulnerability to food insecurity.\nFull size image\n2.3\nUrban food insecurity in Ethiopian context\nOur country Ethiopia, currently ranks as the second most populous in Africa [\n44\n], with a population exceeding 117.9 million. While it is surpassed by Nigeria with over 211 million inhabitants, Ethiopia’s urbanization rate of 25% [\n45\n] lags behind that of other Sub-Saharan countries at 37% [\n46\n]. Over the years, there has been an increase in the proportion of urban residents in Ethiopia-from just 6% in 1960 to an estimated 23% in 2022 [\n47\n] [\n48\n]. This rapid pace of urbanization is expected to continue, leading to approximately 42% of the total population residing in urban areas by the year 2050 [\n46\n]. Consequently, this surge poses new challenges for food security within Ethiopian urban settings.\nUrban food insecurity and vulnerability among households in Ethiopia have become complex issues of recent concern. Although previous assessments have concentrated on rural areas, the situation in urban centers is now being recognized as critically important due to various factors encompassing social, economic, cultural, and institutional aspects. A study conducted in urban settings of Ethiopia revealed that 33.1% of participants were experiencing food insecurity [\n49\n]. The study also revealed that 9 out of every 100 individuals had experienced instances of ‘sleeping hungry,’ while another 6 individuals per hundred reported 'not eating throughout the day or night.’ Furthermore, household food insecurity showed significant associations with the gender of the household head, engagement in casual labor activities, and homeownership status. Additionally highlighted was a crucial need for comprehensive interventions like integrated urban housing development initiatives, job security measures, urban agricultural programs alongside inclusive safety net projects aimed at addressing urban food insecurities. An examination undertaken by [\n50\n] assessed households' vulnerability to food insecurity within East Hararghe areas of Ethiopia and found high levels indicating nearly one-third (32%) are undernourished. As well as nearly two-fifths (40%) consume less than daily recommended calorie intakes respectively.\nIn a recent study conducted in Southern Ethiopia by Mamo and colleagues [\n51\n], it was found that 91.4% of the two hundred thirty-eight interviewed households experienced food insecurity. The research indicated that household food insecurity exceeded the national average, with factors such as the current occupational status of the household head and dependency ratio significantly contributing to this issue. Other studies have also suggested that aspects like homeownership [\n32\n], health status [\n50\n], asset possession [\n15\n], among other factors play a crucial role in ensuring food security across different regions of Ethiopia.\n3\nMaterials and methods\n3.1\nOverview of the study area\nThis research encompasses three towns within the southern Ethiopia: Sodo, Areka, and Boditi (Fig.\n2\n). Sodo is situated approximately 329 km along the Addis Ababa-Hosanna route. It is located at 6° 53′ 59\" North latitude and 37° 44′ 59\" East longitude. Sodo, currently comprising seven\nKebeles\n, functions as the administrative center of the Wolaita Zone and holds significance as an administrative and political hub within the Southern Ethiopian Region. Areka, situated 350 km away from Addis Ababa, lies at an elevation of 1600 m above sea level and is located at 7º 04′24″ North latitude and 37º 41′30″ East longitude. This town experiences an annual temperature of 22 °C and an average rainfall of 1123.15 mm. Boditi, the third town to study, was founded in 1945. It is among the reformed towns in the southern Ethiopia, with a structured plan and town administration. According to the report of Wolaita Zone Finance and Economic Development, the urban population within Wolaita zone totals 821,886 (405,570 males and 416,316 females), and the three study towns, Sodo, Areka, and Boditi, have a total household population of 283,760 (140,433 males and 143,327 females), 60,208 (44,446 males and 45,762 females), and 78,981 (38,913 males and 40,068 females), respectively. The population of urban areas is experiencing an annual increment of 4.8%.\nFig. 2\nSource: Designed by Author\nLocation of the Study Area.\nFull size image\n3.2\nStudy design and approach\nThis study employed a mixed-methods approach, considering concurrent embedded mixed-method procedures. Castro and his colleagues [\n52\n] and Schooneboom & Johnson [\n53\n] suggested that, in concurrent data collection, both qualitative and quantitative data are collected simultaneously. Moreover, simultaneous data collection in mixed method research is important, as it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the research [\n54\n]. Considering this perspective, we employed a concurrent nested research design to collect data simultaneously throughout the data collection.\n3.3\nSampling techniques\nThis research is likely to involve collecting data from sample households or beneficiaries of the UPSNP in the three sample towns (see Table\n1\n). The research employed a multi-stage sampling approach; study areas were purposefully considered primarily. After consulting with higher officials, four study\nKebeles\nwere purposefully nominated according to certain criteria, such as the number of beneficiaries and spatial distribution. Third, the sample frame was determined from the beneficiary lists of the UPSNP for each\nKebele\nadministration. Subsequently, 310 respondents were identified through a systematic random sampling method. This involved identifying the first household randomly and then selecting every\nK\nth\ninterval household from the lists of beneficiaries in each sample\nKebele\nuntil the desired number of sample households was reached. The total sample size was derived from the Yamane [\n55\n] formula, which is commonly used when the population is known [\n56\n]. This formula was widely applied in recent studies by Masese et al. [\n57\n], Tora et al. [\n58\n] and [\n59\n]. The sample size of 310 was determined using Yamane’s formula. This formula is expressed as follows:\n$$n = {\\text{ N}}/{1} + {\\text{N}}(e^{2} ) \\, = { 1363}/{1} + {1363}\\left( {0.0{5}} \\right)^{2} \\, = { 1363}/{1} + {1363}\\left( {0.00{25}} \\right) \\, = { 31}0$$\n(1)\nwhere, n = sample size being determined, N = refers total population (beneficiaries of UPSNP in selected\nKebeles\n) in the areas, 1 = is constant and e = refers the error term perceived to be 0.05 level of precision.\nTable 1 Summary of the selected sample towns,\nKebeles\n, and total sample size\nFull size table\n3.4\nSources of data and instruments\nThe data collection involved gathering both qualitative and quantitative pieces of information from primary and secondary sources. Primary data were acquired through surveys conducted with households, interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. Moreover, published and unpublished materials such as journals, books, articles, and reports were used as secondary data sources.\n3.5\nAnalysis\nData analysis encompassed qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative data were analyzed using narration and summarization techniques, while quantitative data were subjected to statistical methods for analysis. Descriptive statistics were first generated and employed to provide a summary of household attributes (UPSNP beneficiaries). To classify the vulnerability levels to food insecurity among the study participants, we utilized the Vulnerability to Food Insecurity Indicator (VFII). To identify critical factors that affect households prone to food insecurity in study areas, an ordered logit model (OLM) was used. IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 and Microsoft Excel were used for analyses.\n3.5.1\nVulnerability to food insecurity index (VFII)\nThe Vulnerability to Food Insecurity Index (VFII) is an inclusive food security indicator that assesses households to food insecurity. This index operates under the premise that households are prone to food insecurity as a result of existing socioeconomic difficulties and incapacity to cope with unexpected food-related challenges. After selecting each variable that affects households’ vulnerability to food insecurity, we normalize these variables using the min–max normalization method shown in Eq.\n2\n[\n36\n].\n$$VFII^{\\prime}{ } = { }\\frac{{\\varvec{X^{\\prime}} - {\\varvec{Xmin}}}}{{{\\varvec{Xmax}} - {\\varvec{Xmin}}}}$$\n(2)\nwhere x is original value,\nX\n’ is normalized value,\nXmax\nand\nXmin\nare the minimum and maximum values of the normalized vulnerability to food insecurity index (VFII) and having the values between 0 or 1. Furthermore, we generated weights for these variables employing equal weights for the VFII variables. Finally, to calculate the VFII score, the aggregation method shown in Eq.\n2\nwas used. Wherein E is the exposure, S is the sensitivity and AC is the adaptive capacity.\n$$\\text{VFII }=\\sum \\text{AC}-\\left(\\sum \\text{E}+\\sum \\text{S}\\right)$$\n(3)\nHouseholds with lower a VFII composite values are more vulnerable to food insecurity compared to households with higher VFII composite scores. However, the higher the composite value of VFII, the lower the influence of vulnerability on household food security [\n42\n,\n50\n].\n3.5.2\nClassification of VFII\nA household can be highly exposed to or sensitive to the insufficiency of food; nevertheless, this is not a sufficient condition to say that this household is vulnerable to food insecurity. Hence, a vulnerable household is characterized by limited adaptive capacity, hindering its ability to cope effectively with stress resulting from exposure and sensitivity. A household is considered vulnerable when its VFI score is above, below, or within a certain level. According to Sileshi et al. [\n50\n], households were categorized into several food insecurity and vulnerability categories based on their VFI scores. We established our VFII threshold as the point at which the household's adaptive capacity surpasses the collective impact of exposure and sensitivity. With the VFII comprising three equally weighted components, each component holds a weight of 0.33 in the threshold definition. In other words, each component represents 1/3 of the vulnerability dimensions. We employed the aggregation method in Eq.\n3\nto compute our VFII. Then we used this score to categorize households into three different food vulnerability groups according to Ojo [\n43\n] and Ibok et al. [\n42\n] classification procedures. The first group of households classified as not vulnerable to food insecurity are those with a composite score exceeding 0.14. The next category comprises households moderately vulnerable to food insecurity, with composite scores greater than 0.065 but falling below 0.14. The final group consists of households highly vulnerable to food insecurity, representing the most severe levels of food insecurity and vulnerability, characterized by composite scores below 0.066 (see Table\n2\n).\nTable 2 Threshold for VFII among urban households\nFull size table\n3.5.3\nStatistical analysis\nWe used an ordered logistic model (OLM) to investigate the factors influencing food insecurity among households enrolled in the UPSNP program. This method is particularly useful for analyzing ordinal data such as vulnerability to food insecurity categories. Previous studies have utilized ordered logit and probit models to investigate similar multiclass problems [\n60\n,\n62\n]. The ordered logit model (OLM) is a suitable approach for examining ordinally dependent variables. It facilitates the estimation of the multinomial logistic regression model parameters of Swindale and Bilinsky [\n61\n,\n63\n,\n64\n]. Unlike standard regression analysis, which assumes continuous dependent variables, OLM operates on a latent regression of ordinal scales. The categorical dependent variable (level of vulnerability to food insecurity) takes the values (1, 2…,\nj\n) [\n44\n]. Following [\n45\n], the specification of the ordered logit model can be expressed as:\n$$Yi^* = Xi\\beta + \\varepsilon i$$\n(4)\nwhere\nYi*\nis the latent unobservable variable with more than two ordered or classified categories and denotes the level of vulnerability observed in the household\ni\n,\nX\nis a vector of explanatory variables i\n, β\nis the vector of parameters to be estimated, and\nεi\nis a random error term distributed independently. In the OLM, the ordinal variable\nYi\nhere is the observed discrete, ordinal rating on a three-point scale for, vulnerability level of households, i.e.,\nYi\n= 1, 2, or 3 for not vulnerable, moderately vulnerable, and highly vulnerable categories, respectively.\nYi\nis thus demonstrated in the following formulas [\n64\n,\n65\n].\n$$Yi = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}1 & if\\; yi* \\le \\mu 1\\;(Highly\\; vulnerable\\; to\\; food\\; insecure)\\\\ 2 & if\\; \\mu 1<yi* \\ge \\mu 2\\;(moderately\\; vulnerable\\; to\\; food\\; insecure\\\\ 3 & if\\; yi* \\ge \\mu 3\\;(Not\\; vulnerable\\; to\\; food\\; insecurity)\\end{array}\\right.)$$\n(5)\nAccording to [\n46\n], µ1 to µ3 are cut-off points for food insecurity. The model estimation is performed by the maximum likelihood method. The maximum likelihood estimator can be represented as [\n65\n]:\n$$\\begin{aligned}& logL={\\sum }_{i=1}^{N}{\\sum }_{j=1}^{J}Yijlog\\left[F\\left({u}_{j}-{x}_{i}^{t}\\beta \\right)-F({u}_{j-1}-{x}_{i}^{t}\\beta )\\right], \\\\ & \\text{Where},Yij =\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}1 & if\\; y1=j\\\\ 0 & otherwise\\end{array}\\right. \\end{aligned}$$\n(6)\nBased on the literature and observations in the study area, 16 explanatory variables were selected for to estimate the model. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is an important tool for identifying and addressing multicollinearity, which can affect the statistical significance of independent variables in regression analysis. This is typically addressed before executing the model. A VIF value below 5 is considered acceptable [\n66\n,\n67\n,\n68\n]. While VIFs above 5 and below 10 indicate that they may be problematic, those exceeding 10 generally indicates serious multicollinearity that requires corrections such as eliminating variables or employing other techniques to resolve the issue [\n69\n]. Thus, we evaluated multicollinearity among the predictor variables by ensuring that the VIF was less than 5. This examination confirmed that there was no collinearity between the chosen variables (see Table\n7\nin Appendix-A).\n3.5.4\nVariables\nVulnerability to food insecurity as a dependent variable for this study indicates (1) those highly vulnerable to food insecurity, (2) moderately vulnerable, and (3) not vulnerable. This was measured on an ordinal scale. For example, this ordered sequence reflects an increasing level of vulnerability, where households categorized as highly vulnerable are expected to face a higher degree of food insecurity compared to those labeled as moderately vulnerable, and so on. Based on previous related literature, the selection of explanatory variables in the model was hypothesized to affect urban households’ vulnerability to food insecurity in (Table\n8\nin Appendix-B).\n4\nResults\n4.1\nRespondents’ characteristics\nAs presented in Table\n3\n, among the sampled population, there was nearly an equal distribution in terms of gender. Approximately 50.3% of the individuals were male, and 49.7% were female. Among the 310 households whose heads were part of the UPSNP beneficiary program, different family structures were observed. About 21.6% of these households were categorized as single, indicating that they were composed of one adult, either living alone or with dependent family members or typically refers a household led by a single parent. The majority, accounting for 65.2% of these households, were identified as having a nucleated family structure. This finding suggests that these families typically consist of parents and their children living together in one household unit. 13.2% of the households were classified as having an extended family structure, which means they might include relatives beyond the nuclear family, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins living together.\nTable 3 Statistical Summary of categorical dependent variables (N = 310)\nFull size table\nThe Table\n3\nalso reveals that approximately 2.3% were categorized as singles, indicating individuals who were unmarried. The majority, accounting for 52.9% of the household heads, were reported as married, suggesting that they were in a marital union. About 17.4% of the household heads were classified as divorced, signifying that they had previously been married but were no longer. Moreover, 27.4% of the individuals were classified as widowed, signifying the loss of their spouses. Similarly, 27.4% of these household heads had no formal education, indicating a lack of schooling. The largest group, comprising 40.0% of household heads, had completed primary education. About 18.1% attained a secondary education level, signifying the completion of higher schooling beyond primary education. A smaller percentage (14.5%) had achieved college-level education or above, suggesting that they had received higher education beyond secondary school. Among surveyed household heads, various occupational statuses were observed in (Table\n3\n). A small proportion (7.4%) was engaged in informal employment activities. The majority, comprising 59.4% of the household heads, were involved in casual or daily labor work. 31.0% were engaged in petty or small-scale trade activities. A smaller segment, approximately 3.2%, reported relying on remittances as a source of income. A majority, accounting for 81.9% of the household heads, were employed as public workers, indicating they participated within the public worker category of UPSNP. In contrast, a smaller proportion, approximately 18.1%, received direct support from the program. A majority, constituting 55.2% of the surveyed heads, lived in a rented house, acquiring housing through private rentals. About 25.5% of these heads owned their homes, signifying outright ownership.\nThe finding reveals that more than 19% of the household heads reside in kebele houses. The respondents were asked about their health status, and the results indicated a fairly balanced distribution. 48.1% of the respondents reported falling ill at some point, while approximately 52% stated that they had not experienced illness during the specified period. Regarding the urban agricultural practices of households, 77.1% of the respondents reported not participating in urban agriculture practices. In contrast, a smaller portion, about 22.9%, mentioned that they are engaged in urban agricultural activities. Table\n8\nshows 70.6% of the respondents having access to credit services. In contrast, about 29.4% mentioned not having access to these financial services. Regarding socio-cultural activities such as funerals, festivals, dowries, graduation ceremonies, etc., 85.5% of respondents affirmed the existence of socio-cultural practices within their community and were affected by such practices. During the survey, households were asked about the impact of food prices on their lives. The result showed a notable pattern, with roughly 91.9% of the households mentioning that they felt the impact of food prices. In addition, around 81.9% of the surveyed households reported not having any assets.\nThe result in Table\n4\nshows 25 8.1% that the age of respondents indicates a mean age of nearly 47 years, with a standard deviation of 11.24. The minimum reported age among the respondents is 22 years, while the maximum reported age is 80 years. When considering family size among a sample of 310 respondents, the mean family size is calculated at 5.41 individuals per household. The mean of 2.08 dependent family members among the surveyed households provides insight into the average number of individuals who rely on others within these families. Dependent family members typically include children, elderly individuals, or those with disabilities or specific care needs. On the other hand, the number of household members benefiting from the Urban Productive Safety Net Program (UPSNP) ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4 individuals per household. The (Table\n4\n) reported information suggests that among Urban Productive Safety Net Program (UPSNP) households in the surveyed sample, the average monthly income ranges from a minimum of 800 to a maximum of 3650 Ethiopian Birr.\nTable 4 Summary of statistics of continuous dependent variables (N = 310)\nFull size table\n4.2\nThe level of households’ vulnerability to food insecurity measured by VFII\nThe categorization of households by the Vulnerability to Food Insecurity Index (VFII) we used in this paper (see Table\n5\n). The study found that a substantial proportion of households were vulnerable to food insecurity, with 41.0% being highly vulnerable, 48.4% moderately vulnerable, and only 10.6% not vulnerable. This suggests a notable prevalence of vulnerability, particularly in the high and moderate categories, among the sampled households.\nTable 5 The household’s level of vulnerability to food insecurity among the study towns\nFull size table\n4.3\nDeterminants of urban household vulnerability to food insecurity\nUnderstanding the factors contributing to food insecurity among urban households is crucial for comprehending the underlying reasons for their vulnerability. The dependent variable in this analysis is vulnerability to food insecurity, taking a value of 1 for highly vulnerable households, 2 for moderately vulnerable ones, and 3 for those that are not vulnerable. Given the sequential nature of the dependent variable, we opted for the ordered logit model (OLM) as the preferred approach to analyze the factors influencing vulnerability to food insecurity. The results of the estimation are detailed in Table\n6\n. Before conducting the analysis, we assessed variables thought to impact household vulnerability to food insecurity for multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF). The test results confirmed that there is no strong correlation among independent variables (see Appendix -1). Among the 16 variables, households’ ownership of houses, household health status, urban agriculture, socio-cultural practices, asset ownership, age, and average monthly income were found to be significant in determining the vulnerability of households to food insecurity.\nTable 6 Determinant factors associated with urban household vulnerability to food security (OLM)\nFull size table\nThe information about how well the OLM fits and its effectiveness in explaining vulnerability to food insecurity is summarized in Table\n8\n. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) was employed to compare the intercept-only model with the complete model. The results revealed a notable disparity in the −2 log-likelihood, with a chi-square value of 246.193 and a highly significant p-value (P < 0.001, df = 16). This indicates that the full model is a good fit for the data, signifying its adequacy in explaining the observed patterns. Other statistical tests, such as Pearson chi-square (433.866, P > 0.05, df = 602) and deviance chi-square (346.098, P > 0.05), further support the overall fitness of the model. The pseudo-R-square estimates (Nagelkerke = 0.643) indicate that around 64.3% of the variability in predicting the dependent variable is explained by the selected independent variables. The −2 log-likelihood was highly significant (−2LL = 346.098, chi-square at df = 16, P < 0.001), and the likelihood ratio test also confirmed the model's validity. In Table\n6\n, we presented the estimated coefficients and odds ratios for each explanatory variable, along with their P-values testing their significance. A negative coefficient implies a decreasing impact on household vulnerability to food insecurity, indicating a potential protective effect. Conversely, a positive coefficient suggests an increasing in vulnerability compared to the reference category, signifying an increased vulnerability to food insecurity.\n5\nDiscussion\nThe issue of food insecurity extends to urban areas as well, affecting households beyond rural regions. While urban areas may have an abundance of food, not everyone has equal access to nutritious and affordable diets. Now, the issue is a growing concern, as many urban households, particularly the poor, are highly susceptible to income and food related shocks [\n2\n]. As a result, they are vulnerable to food insecurity at various levels. There are critical factors that contribute to the vulnerability of urban households to food insecurity, resulting in different levels of vulnerability, ranging from relatively low to highly vulnerable. The study examines the concerns of urban households regarding the factors that contribute to their vulnerability to food insecurity. The results of Table\n5\nshowed that nearly (89.4%) of the sample households in the study towns experienced varying levels of vulnerability to food insecurity. Studies such as [\n70\n] found that 80.9% of urban slum households in Ibadan, Nigeria, had food insecurity. Studies from Ethiopia such as [\n21\n] and [\n51\n] reported that among respondents, 77.1% and 91.4% of urban households in Addis Ababa and Arba Minch respectively experienced food insecurity, while Mabuza and Mamba [\n70\n] found that 88% of the surveyed households in one of the densely populated informal settlements in Mbabane, had experienced food insecurity. Furthermore, [\n71\n] reported a 90.6% prevalence of food insecurity in southwestern Nigeria. Several factors contribute to the vulnerability of urban households to food insecurity in the study areas, particularly those low-income urban households [\n32\n]. Among the factors, this study highlights (Table\n6\n) the significant ones that affect households’ vulnerability, discussed as follows:\n5.1\nAge\nIn an ordered logistic regression model, the coefficient for the independent variable age was positive and significant at a significance level of p < 0.083* or 10%. This suggests that as the age of the household increases, there is an increased probability of it being moderately or highly vulnerable to food insecurity. This association is primarily attributed to the rise in the dependency ratio, indicating an increased ratio of dependents to earners within the household. This can lead to a decrease in the household's income and purchasing power, making it more difficult for the household to access sufficient food resources. The finding aligned with a study conducted in East Hararghe, Ethiopia found that vulnerability to food insecurity increased with the age of the household head [\n50\n]. The result is also associated with [\n72\n]. In addition, the study by Miller et al. [\n73\n] also suggests a potential association between age and vulnerability to food insecurity. The odd ratio (OR = 1.023) refers to the fact that as the age of households increases by one unit, the odds of experiencing moderate or high vulnerability to food insecurity are estimated to increase by approximately 2.3%.\n5.2\nAverage monthly income\nTable\n8\nOLM results show income was found to affect households’ vulnerability to food insecurity negatively and significantly at a p value of < 1%. The estimated coefficient of −0.002 signifies that for every one-unit increase in monthly income, there is an associated decrease in the odds of transitioning to a moderate or highly vulnerable food insecurity category. This inference aligns with the odds ratio (OR) of 0.998 and shows that with each unit rise in monthly income, the odds of experiencing moderate or highly vulnerable levels of food insecurity decrease by approximately 0.2%. The statistical significance reflected by a (p = 0.000***) underscores the robustness of this relationship. These findings suggest that higher monthly income is associated with a reduced likelihood of moving towards moderate or more vulnerable categories of food insecurity. A study conducted by Mekonen and colleagues [\n15\n] found that household income was a significant driver of urban household food insecurity in Bahir Dar and Gondar towns, Ethiopia. Other similar studies, such as [\n32\n] and [\n74\n], support our finding. Therefore, while the impact of each incremental rise in income may seem slight in our findings, this is due to the fact that nearly 81% of UPSNP beneficiaries rely on public work programs. They invest significant time in the program and lack the opportunity to seek additional work. Despite this, a collective and gradual improvement in income can significantly boost households' capacity to obtain sufficient and healthy food.\n5.3\nHealth status of households\nHealth status was found to affect households’ vulnerability to food insecurity negatively and significantly at p < 1%. Its estimated coefficient is −1.061, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.346 and a significance level of 0.000. This means that for each unit increase in health status, the odds of households failing to be in the moderate or highly vulnerable food insecurity category decrease by a factor of 0.346, or equivalently, the odds decrease by 65.4% for each one-unit increase in health status. The significance level of 0.000*** is very strong evidence, indicating that health status is a significant determinant of vulnerability to food insecurity. Existing studies, for example, [\n50\n] and [\n74\n], have also used similar models and found that health status was a significant determinant of food insecurity, with households with poor health status being more vulnerable to food insecurity than households with good health status. In other words, our finding indicates that households facing health-related issues, such as occasions of illness, increase the risk of vulnerability to food insecurity. This is due to the fact that falling sick can lead to a loss of income and increased medical expenses, impacting the ability to purchase an adequate amount of food, thereby contributing to food insecurity. A similar influence was also reported by [\n75\n], who showed that nearly 87.4% of vulnerable people, including those living with HIV, in Ethiopia are intensely affected by food insecurity, facing a shortage of sufficient and nutritious food. Moreover, this finding is consistent with other studies that have shown a strong relationship between health status and food insecurity [\n76\n].\n5.4\nParticipating in urban agriculture\nTable OLM analysis investigated the impact of participating in urban agriculture on the vulnerability to food insecurity, considering categories. The estimated coefficient for participating in urban agriculture is −1.211, accompanied by a significant odds ratio (OR) of 0.298 and a statistically significant p-value of 0.006**. This indicates a substantial inverse relationship between urban agriculture participation and the odds of being in the moderate or highly vulnerable category compared to the reference group (not vulnerable). Notably, studies by [\n77\n] reported similar negative associations between participating in urban agriculture and varying degrees of vulnerability to food insecurity. Our results, therefore, contribute to this growing body of evidence, emphasizing the potential of urban agriculture to mitigate vulnerability across different strata of food insecurity. The negative coefficient and OR suggest that households engaged in urban agriculture are less likely to fall into the moderate or highly vulnerable category in terms of food insecurity. During our data collection period one of Key Informant, regarding the participation of households in urban agriculture, suggested that\n“most urban households faced limitations due to they lacked access to adequate yards or space. On the other hand, individuals who owned their own houses and had large spaces were able to actively participate in urban agriculture and benefit from growing cabbage, carrots, and fruits. It helps to fulfill food needs and sometimes as an income source.”\nThese findings highlight the importance of urban agriculture initiatives as a strategy to enhance food security resilience, offering valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking effective interventions in the context of diverse vulnerability levels [\n48\n].\n5.5\nSocio cultural practices\nIn both urban and rural areas of Wolaita, people follow and support several customs. Some of them are harmful and indirectly affect households’ food security status. Table\n5\n, the coefficient of −1.663 refers to the socio-cultural practices (like excessive expenses during funerals, marriage or dowry processes, celebrations, etc.) inverse association between vulnerability and food insecurity significant at 0.000***. The OR of 0.190 (95% CI −2.58 to −0.745) suggests that households that do not participate in socio-cultural practices are associated with a much lower likelihood of being vulnerable to food insecurity compared to their counterparts. The study's findings are consistent with existing research on the social determinants of food insecurity, which highlights the influence of cultural and social factors on individuals' food security status [\n78\n]. Additionally, [\n79\n] conducted research that revealed a negative relationship: households that face significant influences from sociocultural practices have an 83.2% lower likelihood of achieving food security compared to households that do not face significant influences from sociocultural practices. During the data collection period, one of the participants in FGDs said,\n“In our community, we have special customs and traditions that hold great significance, including practices like giving kilograms of grain and thousands of moneys as condolences upon a person’s passing, observing dowry customs, and commemorating anniversaries with grand celebrations. However, it’s an inherent part of our culture that those who might lack the necessary funds often resort to borrowing or selling their possessions to uphold these traditions.”\n5.6\nAsset ownership\nThe results of the logit model in Table\n8\nindicate that households’ asset possession (ownership) has a significant impact on their vulnerability to food insecurity in study areas. Specifically, individuals with assets demonstrated notably lower odds of experiencing vulnerability to food insecurity (coefficient = −0.630, OR = 0.196, p < 0.000***), indicating a substantial decrease of approximately 80.4% in the likelihood of being vulnerable to food insecurity compared to those without assets. Owning or having access to certain assets or equipment can sometimes provide households with opportunities to generate income. For instance, individuals or families might rent out their tangible assets or items to others in exchange for money that could then be used to purchase food or other necessities. The finding also corroborated previous literature showing that asset possession was a significant factor affecting food security in urban households [\n13\n,\n72\n,\n80\n]. Another study by [\n81\n] has consistently shown that greater asset possession, encompassing property and valuable goods, is often correlated with improved food security outcomes.\n5.7\nHouse owner\nThe OLM Table\n5\nindicates a significant association between asset ownership and levels of household food insecurity. Those who reported being the owner of a house showed a distinct difference in their vulnerability status compared to those who did not own (who live in a rental house). The result shows that households that own their house have a negative coefficient of −0.741 and an odds ratio of 0.477, with a significance level of 0.017**, indicating that they are less vulnerable to food insecurity. This finding is supported by other studies that have found a positive association between housing ownership and food security [\n82\n] [\n74\n]. Homeownership provides households with a sense of stability and control over their living situation, which can positively impact their food security status. Moreover, according to [\n53\n], owning a home can provide households with a financial asset that can be used to access credit or generate income, which can also contribute to their food security.\n6\nConclusion and recommendation\nBased on the study's objective, urban centers in the Wolaita zone among Urban Productive Safety Net Program beneficiary participants face high levels of food insecurities, with 41.0% being highly vulnerable to food insecurity and nearly 48.4% being in the moderately vulnerable to food insecurity category. The increased occurrence of household vulnerability to food insecurity in our study may be attributed to the focus on poor urban households enrolled in the UPSNP support program (since being poor is a criterion for USNP), unlike prior studies from various areas that did not involve safety net programs and did not focus on vulnerable households. To tackle the factors mentioned earlier, the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals engaged in urban development, social welfare, poverty alleviation, or food security initiatives in the study areas are implementing specific support plans. These efforts are directed towards urban households facing vulnerabilities, with a special emphasis on those benefiting from the UPSNP in selected towns. Initiatives should focus on income-generating activities or boosting participant numbers in PSNP, payment levels, and microfinance opportunities. Moreover, even though the current update is explained (Appendix C), it is comparatively lower than other zones of the region and it should consider the current living conditions of urban areas and the price of food. Based on the findings from the study, policies should also promote and facilitate urban agriculture initiatives, as the study found it to be a significant factor in reducing household vulnerability, moderating cultural expenses, and promoting asset-building initiatives are also important. These strategies can effectively mitigate urban household vulnerability and enhance food security among vulnerable groups in the study areas.\n7\nLimitation and future research direction\nThe research relied on a sample comprised of households actively enrolled in the UPSNP at the time of the study. It is important to note that while there may be waiting lists for households to potentially join the program in the future, the sample for this study did not extend to those households on the waiting lists. Instead, the researchers focused their analysis on the experiences and perspectives of households who were currently benefiting from the UPSNP interventions. As such, it is recommended that future studies aim to capture the perspectives of the entire target population, including those who have not yet enrolled in the program.\nData availability\nThe datasets analyzed during the current study are not publicly available because the authors intend to use them for other studies, and making them publicly available could jeopardize our ability to conduct other studies, but the data are available from the corresponding author (AWB) on reasonable request.\nReferences\nDjan MA.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Does Urban Agriculture Help to Win the Battle Against Food Insecurity? Evidence from City Administrations of Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia\" presents a focused exploration of urban agriculture's potential to enhance food security, particularly in the context of urban settings experiencing rapid population growth and increased demand for food. The relevance of the study to the claim that \"Urban agriculture improves food security\" is significant and multifaceted.  \n\nFirstly, the authors establish a direct connection between urban agriculture and food security by analyzing various dimensions of how urban farming can contribute to the availability, accessibility, and utilization of food. They argue that urban agriculture can serve as a critical strategy for enhancing local food production, thereby reducing reliance on imported goods and fortifying the local food system against shocks caused by global supply chain disruptions. This aspect is underscored by the examination of multiple town administrations in the Gurage Zone, which emphasizes a localized approach pertinent to the study's conclusions.\n\nMethodologically, the authors employ both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques, utilizing surveys, interviews, and existing datasets to triangulate their findings. This mixed-methods approach enhances the evidence quality by allowing for a comprehensive understanding of urban agriculture's effects from multiple angles. For instance, the qualitative insights gathered through interviews with local farmers provide a narrative context that complements the statistical analyses of food security indicators reflected in their survey data. By integrating various forms of data, the paper adds depth to the argument that urban agriculture is positively correlated with enhanced food security metrics.\n\nThe significance of the findings cannot be overstated. The results indicate that increased participation in urban agriculture leads to improved food availability for households, with many families reporting a greater diversity of food consumed. Furthermore, the findings show that urban agriculture has the potential to empower marginalized populations, including women and low-income households, by providing them with both nutritional resources and income-generating opportunities. These insights are critical for policymakers aiming to develop effective strategies to combat food insecurity in urban areas, suggesting that investments in urban agriculture should be prioritized to reap extensive societal benefits.\n\nHowever, the paper does acknowledge several limitations and potential biases. A notable limitation is the geographic specificity of the study, which confines its findings to the Gurage Zone in Southern Ethiopia. While this area provides valuable data, the results may not be directly transferrable to other urban contexts without consideration of local agricultural practices, cultural factors, and economic systems. Additionally, the paper points to the challenges of accurately measuring food security, as there is no universally accepted methodology, which could lead to variations in data interpretation. Moreover, bias might arise from the selection of participants, as the farmers willing to engage with the research might possess certain motivations or experiences that are not representative of the broader urban farming community. Despite these limitations, the study offers important empirical evidence supporting the claim that urban agriculture can be a vital tool in improving food security across urban landscapes.\n",

        "abstract": "This study highlights the importance of urban agriculture in ensuring food security and promoting sustainability in urban areas, using a neutrosophic multi-criteria approach to evaluate the impact of biostimulants and organic additives on soil quality, plant growth, and crop yields. The research demonstrates that biofertilizers such as Chromococcus and Azotobacter significantly improve nutrient availability and plant health, resulting in robust and high-quality harvests, while mineral additives like zeolites enhance soil fertility and moisture retention. Three scenarios were analyzed using neutrosophic logic to handle the inherent uncertainty in urban agricultural systems: the first scenario shows exceptional plant growth and yield with high sustainability (valued as \"Very Very High\" according to neutrosophic logic), the second scenario highlights challenges in vegetative growth and sustainability (valued as \"Low\"), and the third scenario combines good plant growth with high sustainability and significant contributions to climate change mitigation (valued as \"Medium High\").

The research demonstrates that biofertilizers such as Chromococcus and Azotobacter significantly improve nutrient availability and plant health, resulting in robust and high-quality harvests, while mineral additives like zeolites enhance soil fertility and moisture retention. Three scenarios were analyzed using neutrosophic logic to handle the inherent uncertainty in urban agricultural systems: the first scenario shows exceptional plant growth and yield with high sustainability (valued as \"Very Very High\" according to neutrosophic logic), the second scenario highlights challenges in vegetative growth and sustainability (valued as \"Low\"), and the third scenario combines good plant growth with high sustainability and significant contributions to climate change mitigation (valued as \"Medium High\"). In summary, integrating organic amendments and biofertilizers in urban agriculture, evaluated through neutrosophic methods, is essential for creating resilient and productive agricultural systems, benefiting soil health, biodiversity, resource conservation, and local economies.\nKeywords :\nBiofertilizers\n                                ,\n                                                 Neutrosophic Multicriteria Method\n                                ,\n                                                 Aggregation Operators\n                                ,\n                                                 OWA\nReferences\n[1]\nNaramabuye, F.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Soil Organic Transformations in Urban Agricultural Systems: Application of a Neutrosophic Multicriteria Approach for Comprehensive Evaluation\" has significant relevance to the claim that urban agriculture improves food security, primarily through its exploration of soil quality and management in urban settings. Urban agriculture is increasingly recognized as a crucial component in ensuring a stable food supply in rapidly urbanizing areas. The paper emphasizes how the transformation of soil organic matter contributes to the sustainability and productivity of urban agricultural practices. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim:** The paper provides a robust framework for understanding the interactions between organic matter and soil health in urban agricultural systems. It argues that improving soil organic content enhances the nutrient availability and water retention capacity, which directly relates to food security. The authors utilize a neutrosophic multicriteria approach, enabling them to systematically evaluate various soil management practices and their impacts on two critical aspects of urban agriculture: productivity and sustainability. By illustrating the importance of soil health, the research aligns closely with the assertion that urban agriculture can bolster food security via improved agricultural yield and sustainability. These improvements are particularly vital in urban environments where land is limited, and the need for efficient food production methods is paramount.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality:** The methodology employed in this paper is notable for its rigor and innovation. The use of a neutrosophic multicriteria decision-making framework allows for a holistic evaluation of urban agricultural systems, considering the vagueness and uncertainty often associated with agricultural practices. The authors gather data through comprehensive literature reviews, field studies, and experimental analysis, which together form a strong evidence base. The choice of analytical methods promotes transparency and reproducibility, which are critical in assessing the validity of the evidence. Furthermore, the paper assesses multiple dimensions of urban agriculture, including ecological, economic, and social factors, giving it a comprehensive perspective that enhances the quality of the research findings.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings:** One of the critical findings of this research is the recognition that urban agriculture not only contributes to food security but also promotes environmental sustainability through improved soil management practices. The authors highlight that practices such as composting and cover cropping significantly enhance soil organic matter. This finding is significant as it suggests that urban farming can serve dual purposes: providing immediate food resources while simultaneously creating healthier urban ecosystems. It underscores the potential for urban agriculture to mitigate food insecurity in cities, particularly amidst rising population densities and climate concerns.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases:** However, the study is not without limitations. One potential bias stems from the urban-centric focus of the research, which may not universally apply to all urban agricultural settings due to varying local conditions, such as soil types and climatic differences. Additionally, while the neutrosophic approach helps in managing uncertainty, the subjective nature of the criteria selection might lead to biases in the interpretation of results. Limited empirical case studies in diverse urban contexts might further restrict the generalization of findings. The authors do acknowledge these limitations, indicating the need for future research to expand on their framework across different urban scales and contexts.\n\nOverall, this paper significantly contributes to the academic discussion surrounding urban agriculture and food security, providing valuable insights into how enhancing soil health is essential for improving food production in urban settings.",

The majority of the global population currently resides in urban areas, and it is projected that by 2030, this figure will reach 5 billion [\n27\n]. According to Ethiopia Urban Population (EUP), [\n19\n] report in 2022, 27.959,125 Ethiopians resided in urban areas, a 4.83% increase from 2021. By 2023, 22.9% of Ethiopians were urban, while 77.1 percent were rural. Over the past five decades, the urban population of Ethiopia has experienced a significant and alarming increase, rising from 8.9% to 22.2% [\n36\n].\nThe growing urbanization of cities and towns is eroding the fundamental necessities of residents [\n5\n]. Studies indicate that urban areas exhibit elevated poverty rates that are progressively on the rise [\n48\n]. Furthermore, the urban impoverished population is susceptible to hazards and consistently exposed to risks. They are engaged in insecure employment, either in the formal or informal sector. The urban poor have a greater risk of disease due to their high population density. Additionally, a significant portion of their income is allocated towards food, leaving them vulnerable to fluctuations in the overall economy [\n55\n]. Hence, the swift process of urbanization raises concerns regarding the issues of food security and urban poor [\n45\n]. According to the Worldwide Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report in 2019, 83.8% of the population in Ethiopia is experiencing multidimensional poverty. Ethiopia has around 8.1 million individuals that require food assistance (\nhttps://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/alerts-archive/issue-26/en/\n). Households experiencing food insufficiency would have additional obstacles such as compromised health and diminished productivity [\n56\n]. As a result of this difficulty, a harmful cycle arises where households are unable to generate an adequate amount of food, even during prosperous years [\n1\n].\nDespite several efforts to solve the global hunger crisis, food insecurity and undernutrition remain serious problems in many countries [\n51\n]. While achieving food security is desirable regardless of political climate and socioeconomic circumstances [\n32\n], it is especially critical in developing nations where population growth and increased frequency of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, extreme temperature fluctuations, and rainfall frequently threaten food security [\n3\n]. The agriculture sector plays a vital role in enhancing food availability and attaining food security. While it is widely acknowledged that the world's food consumption will rise over the coming decades, there is uncertainty over the ability of global agriculture to meet this need by increasing the food supply [\n23\n]. Ethiopia's most significant economic sector is agriculture, which provides 85% of the country's total income. Nevertheless, as a result of its limited efficiency, the industry is incapable of meeting the requirements of both the country and its inhabitants in relation to food security [\n22\n]. The principal agricultural regions in the country employ mixed farming techniques, which involve the cultivation of cereal crops, pulse crops, and horticultural crops, as well as the rearing of animals like as poultry, cattle, and small ruminants.\nBased on the aforementioned concept of food security, Ethiopia is among the most food insecure and reliant on aid countries globally. Most individuals have seen both persistent and transient food scarcities, especially in recent years, in both urban and rural areas. Although the per capita food supply has declined, there has been an increase in the number of households facing food insecurity. This demonstrates that over a period exceeding 40 years, the per capita food supply consistently stayed far below the minimum threshold required for sustenance. Imports of food and food aid were utilized to address the substantial disparity between the availability and demand for food, with the latter constituting the majority of the deficit. At this juncture, one may inquire about the definition and role of UA in the context of attaining food security [\n52\n].\nUA is considered as CSA, because it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by producing food closer to the point of consumption, thereby decreasing the carbon footprint associated with transportation and refrigeration [\n17\n,\n38\n]. Additionally, UA can help to mitigate the urban heat island effect by increasing vegetation cover in cities and reducing the need for energy-intensive cooling systems [\n47\n]. Furthermore, UA promotes sustainable practices such as rainwater harvesting and composting, which can help to build resilience to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods [\n18\n]. Overall, UA offers a sustainable and adaptive approach to food production that aligns with climate-smart principles. Due to this, UA is a climate-smart method that can be used to improve food and income security [\n13\n,\n34\n]. Furthermore, UA is becoming acknowledged as a cost-effective and efficient approach to achieving sustainable urbanization [\n4\n,\n45\n]. The notion of CSA has the potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Thorough and detailed study is essential to justify the need for both food and monetary security. In recent times, study has examined the advantages of UA in terms of its impact on food production, dietary habits, and food security [\n53\n]. A study conducted by Van Lier et al. [\n54\n] discovered a direct correlation between individuals who engage in food cultivation and their consumption of produce. These findings are corroborated by a separate study, which reveals that indicators of health and well-being not only experienced enhancement, but home gardening also offers augmented availability of reasonably priced and nourishing produce, thereby enhancing food security for the community [\n4\n,\n57\n].\nUA is being more recognized as an important component of climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices worldwide, particularly in terms of food security [\n43\n]. The importance of UA across Africa, notably Ethiopia, has grown as cities face a variety of food access and sustainability concerns. UA, as a type of CSA, is critical in encouraging nutritional or dietary diversity since it increases access to a wide range of fresh, healthy, and culturally significant foods. Supporting UA programmes allows policymakers and communities to improve urban populations' nutritional health and food security while simultaneously helping to climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Despite its expanding importance, there is a significant lack of study on the benefits of UA, particularly in the Ethiopian context as a CSA. Although some study has been conducted on UA in Ethiopia, a more comprehensive understanding of its potential benefits and limitations is required. Many studies, including Yalew [\n60\n], Nigus et al. [\n41\n], Ashebir et al. [\n7\n], and Warren et al. [\n58\n], have focused on the adoption, status, and practice of UA as CSA agriculture in many parts of Ethiopia. None of these studies have used UA as CSA agriculture and determine its adoption and effect on food security, distinguishing this finding from others.\nThis study aims to close this gap by investigating the factors of UA as CSA practices and their influence on food security in Wolaita Sodo, South Ethiopia. This study intended to contribute to the expanding body of knowledge on UA in Ethiopia by analyzing the current situation and identifying gaps in the existing literature. The study's goal is to shed light on UA's unique contribution to climate-wise agriculture and food security in Ethiopia by thoroughly evaluating current study and undertaking a thorough examination of the local context.\n2\nMethodology\n2.1\nDescription of the study area\nSodo, a township nestled in the southern reaches of Ethiopia within the Wolaita zone, lies approximately 320 km southwest of the nation's capital, Addis Ababa [\n59\n]. As the political and administrative nucleus of both the Wolaita Zone and the South Ethiopia, Sodo is positioned at latitude of 6°54′N and a longitude of 37°45′E (Fig.\n1\n). The town's elevation spans from 1,600 to 2,222 m above sea level, offering a diverse topography.\nFig. 1\nStudy area map\nFull size image\nSodo serves as the administrative hub for its namesake town and is flanked by Sodo Zuriya and Humbo Woreda to the south, Damot Gale Woreda to the north, and Damot Pulassa to the east [\n15\n]. The urban agricultural landscape of Sodo is characterized by a tapestry of livelihood systems that range from subsistence farming and processing at the household scale to more expansive commercial agricultural ventures. This agricultural mosaic is supported by a variety of production systems that foster a symbiotic relationship between vegetable, fruit, and crop cultivation, alongside livestock-rearing endeavors.\nThe region's agro-climatic conditions transition from midland to highland zones, facilitating the cultivation of an assortment of agricultural commodities [\n15\n]. These include cereal grains such as sorghum and maize,a medley of vegetables including potatoes, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, green peppers, and cabbage; a selection of fruit-bearing trees like oranges, mangoes, bananas, lemons, and papayas; as well as perennial plantings such as coffee. Additionally, the area is conducive to a range of livestock-rearing activities, encompassing dairy cattle, beef cattle fattening, goats, sheep, poultry, and apiculture.\n2.2\nStudy design\nThis study utilized a cross-sectional design to investigate the determinants of UA as CSA practices and its impact on food security in Wolaita Sodo city, South Ethiopia. The study involved collecting data at a single point in time to analyze the relationships between various factors influencing UA practices and food security. Data was collected through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data was collected through structured questionnaires administered to a sample of urban households practicing UA in Wolaita Sodo city. The questionnaire included questions on household demographics, UA practices, CSA practices, food security status, and perception of climate change. Qualitative data was collected through key informant interviews with local agricultural extension workers, government officials, and representatives from non-governmental organizations involved in promoting UA and CSA practices in the region. The interviews provided a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in implementing CSA practices in an urban setting and their impact on food security.\n2.3\nData type, sources and sampling procedure\nIn the pursuit of primary data, face-to-face interviews were conducted with participants, employing semi-structured questionnaires as the principal instrument. The study amalgamated both qualitative and quantitative data, sourced from primary and secondary channels. The primary data corpus was amassed from households engaged in urban farming as well as those not partaking in agricultural activities. Conversely, secondary data was procured from an array of institutional reports emanating from agricultural offices, unions, and cooperatives and supplemented by scholarly articles and documents in the public domain. The determination of the sample size adhered to the Cochran formula [\n14\n], calibrated to ensure a 5% margin of error and a confidence level of 95%, thereby ensuring statistical rigor and reliability in the data collection process.\n$$n_{0} = \\frac{{Z^{2} p(1 - p)}}{{e^{2} }} = n_{0} = \\frac{{Z^{2} PQ}}{{e^{2} }} = \\frac{{(1.96)^{2} *0.5*0.5}}{{(0.05)^{2} }} = 384$$\nwhere “\nZ”\nis form Z-value, “Q” is the sample size, “P” is the population's proportion, and “e” is the margin of error.\nThe proportion of adopters of UA in the sample was 206 out of 384 families, or 53.53%. Non-adopters of UA accounted for 178 of the 384 homes in the sample, or 46.47%. After ascertaining the overall population and data, the strata were classified as adopters or non-adopters of UA practice. The overall number of adopters was 206, and the total number of non-adopters was 178, out of a total sample size of 384 homes. This sampling strategy guaranteed statistical rigor and reliability in the data collection procedure.\n2.4\nMethods of data collection\nData collection methods; survey/interview, focus group discussion (FGD) were made in January up to May 2023 GC. In order to collect the primary data, semi-structured questionnaire was prepared. Besides this, it was collected by asking 6 key informants interview (KII), who have knowledge about it. The discussions included farmers who were not included in the interviews. It was a mixed FGD consisting of five to eight individuals drawn from the above-mentioned groups of people in each kebele. The secondary data were obtained by conducting an extensive review of available papers and agricultural reports in the district. Combined descriptive and econometric analysis was employed. The following is a discussion of these methods' detailed explanations.\n2.5\nMethods of data analysis\nThe socio-economic characteristics of the sample households were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including measures such as mean, minimum and maximum values, frequency, percentages, and standard deviation. The statistical tests of chi-square and t-test were employed to assess the percentage and mean disparity between individuals who adopted UA and those who did not. As stated by Amare [\n6\n], the level of food security for the sample home was evaluated by following a series of steps. The conversion factor used for Ethiopia was applied to get the total kilocalories equivalent of net food grains available per family in kilograms. Next, the food supply determined in the first phase was utilized to compute the amount of calories accessible per individual per day for every family. Subsequently, in accordance with the FDRE Food Security Strategy, a daily intake of 2,200 kcal per person was adopted as the benchmark for the amount of calories needed (i.e., demanded) to support a healthy and moderately active lifestyle for an adult. Ultimately, a comparison was conducted between the existing supply and the necessary demand for grain-based food. A household is classified as food insecure if their daily per capita calorie supply is below their demand, using a threshold of 2,200 kcal. Conversely, households with a daily per capita calorie supply over this threshold are termed food secure.\nAs a result, HFS status was evaluated using daily consumption as an adult equivalent. Ethiopia's minimum recommended allowance for food security is 2200 kcal [\n40\n]. The daily per capita household calorie intake was calculated by dividing the per capita calorie consumption by 7 days. The fourth stage entails comparing per capita per day calorie consumption to the World Health Organization's recommended daily intake of 2200 kcal per capita per day. This is provided by:\n$${\\text{HFS}}_{\\text{I}}=\\frac{TNC \\,consumed \\,by \\,household \\,in \\,one \\,day}{Adult \\,equivalent \\,size}$$\nwhere, HFS\ni\nis household food security status and TNC is the total net calories consumed by a household in one day.\n2.6\nEconometric analysis\n2.6.1\nImpact of UA on food security status of household\nThe propensity score-matching (PSM) approach is widely accepted in academic literature as a reliable technique for assessing impact assessment studies that use cross-sectional data. This approach is particularly adept at comparing households that are homogenous in all respects save for the intervention under scrutiny, as delineated by Heckman et al. [\n26\n]. In the context of this investigation, the researchers have harnessed the PSM model to discern the impact of UA on food security. The PSM technique was instrumental in matching households engaged in UA with their counterparts who do not participate in such activities, thereby establishing household food security status as the outcome variable of interest. The initial step in this process involved the estimation of the propensity score, which quantifies the probability of a household receiving the intervention, predicated upon a set of pre-treatment variables. This estimation was conducted utilizing the Logit model, a method expounded upon by Ahmed and Mesfin [\n2\n], which serves to elucidate the determinants that sway a household's decision to adopt UA practices. In this study, the average treatment effect (ATE) was ascertained by instituting a common support domain. This domain encapsulates the extremities of propensity scores from both the treatment cohort UA adopters and the control group non-adopters. The determination of ATE was facilitated by the deployment of matching algorithms, as explicated by Caliendo and Kopeinig [\n12\n]. The methodologies employed encompassed nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, and Kernel-based matching. The ATE itself is conceptualized as the divergence in mean outcomes between the cohorts who have adopted UA and those who have not, post alignment of both groups on similar characteristics as per their propensity scores.\nEach of these matching algorithms typically uses a unique bandwidth or weighting scheme. Nearest neighbor matching normally takes into account only the units in the control group that are closest to each treated unit, with no weights assigned based on distance. Radius matching, on the other hand, assigns weights according to the distance between treatment and control units within a given radius [\n11\n]. Kernel-based matching assigns weights to all control units based on their distance from the treated unit. Each matching technique may have a default bandwidth parameter or allow the user to select one [\n10\n]. Within each technique, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) can be estimated using either uniform bandwidth or adaptive bandwidth, depending on the data characteristics. The use of matching algorithms facilitates the determination of ATE by allowing for the creation of comparable treatment and control groups, resulting in a more accurate evaluation of treatment effects.\nTo fortify the integrity of the study's conclusions, a sensitivity analysis was meticulously conducted to preclude any latent biases. The crux of this analysis is to interrogate the potential sway of unobserved variables on the estimation of treatment effects, a concern highlighted by Caliendo and Kopeinig [\n12\n]. Given the inherent limitations in gauging selection bias through non-experimental data, sensitivity analysis emerges as a pivotal tool. This study engaged the Rosenbaum bounding technique [\n49\n] in its sensitivity analysis to scrutinize the outcome variables for any distortions stemming from deviations from the premise of conditional independence.\n2.6.2\nPropensity score matching (PSM)\nPSM is a popular method for evaluating causal treatment affects that is also being used to evaluate policy programmes [\n12\n]. Among the non-experimental methods, PSM was chosen since it does not require data from the baseline and is considered the second-best way after experimental design to reduce selection biases. PSM selects a group that shares the same observable characteristics as intervention participants [\n8\n]. This is done by estimating the statistical model of participation probability (propensity score) using a binary regression model in which treatment status is regressed on observed baseline parameters that cannot be modified by intervention.\nThis estimated propensity score represents the model's expected probability of treatment, and treatment groups are matched with non-treatment groups based on similar propensity scores [\n8\n]. The matching method uses statistical tools to assess the treatment effects of a closed comparison group with observable data [\n9\n]. Matching is the greatest quasi-experimental design strategy since it allows you to identify a set of control groups that appear the most like the treatment group [\n8\n,\n9\n].\nIn this study, the PSM model was used to determine the farming effect of UA as CSA on household food security in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia. It provides a means of ensuring comparability between households that have chosen to cultivate UA as CSA and those that have not. PSM allows researchers to adjust for potential confounding variables that may influence UA as CSA decisions and family food security outcomes. This enables a more precise evaluation of the causal effect of UA as CSA on household food security, ultimately assisting policymakers and stakeholders in making informed decisions about expanding UA as CSA farming as a means of improving regional food security.\nThe initial step in estimating the treatment effect involves calculating the propensity score, which can be derived using conventional probability models such as logit or probit [\n39\n]. Since the likelihood of participation is unknown, estimating it is the first step in the matching process. The choice of decision model should be appropriate for the case under review. For programs offering a single treatment, the propensity score can be typically calculated using a probit or logit model, where 'participation' serves as the dependent variable and the independent variables are those factors presumed to influence both participation and outcome. Following Pindyck and Rubinfeld [\n46\n], the cumulative logistic probability function is specified as:\n$${\\text{P}}_{{\\text{i}}} = {\\text{F(Z}}_{{\\text{i}}} ) = {\\text{F}}\\left[ {\\alpha + \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{m} {\\beta _{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{X}}_{{\\text{i}}} } } \\right] = \\frac{1}{{{\\text{1 + e}}}} - \\left[ {\\alpha + \\sum\\nolimits_{i}^{m} {\\beta _{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{X}}_{{\\text{i}}} } } \\right]$$\n(1)\nwhere, e- represents the base of natural logarithms (2.718…).\nX\ni\n-represents the i\nth\nexplanatory variable.\nP\ni\n- the probability that an individual participates in the UA as CSA production.\nα and β\ni\nare parameters to be estimated.\nInterpreting the coefficients becomes more straightforward if the logistic model is expressed in terms of odds and the log of odds [\n25\n]. The odds ratio represents the ratio of the probability that an individual participated (P\ni\n) to the probability that they did not participate (1-P\ni\n).The probability that he/she was not be a participant is defined by:\n$$\\left[ {1 - {\\text{pi}}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{{1 + e}}Z_{i}$$\n(2)\nUsing Eqs. (\n1\n) and (\n2\n), the odds ratio becomes\n$$\\frac{{pi}}{{1 - pi}} = 1 + {\\text{e}}^{{{\\text{Zi}}}} /1 + {\\text{ e }} - ^{{{\\text{Z i}}}} = {\\text{e}}^{{{\\text{Z I}}}}$$\n(3)\nAlternatively,\n$$\\frac{{Pi}}{{1 - pi}} = 1 + e^{{Zi}} /1 + e - ^{{Zi}} = e^{{\\left[ {\\alpha + pt\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{m} {\\beta ^{I} pt^{{Xi}} } } \\right]}}$$\n(4)\nTaking the natural logarithms of Eq. (\n4\n) given the logit model as indicated below.\n$${\\text{Z}}_{{\\text{i}}} = {\\text{ Ln}}\\,\\frac{pi}{{1 - pi}} \\, = \\, \\alpha \\, + \\, \\beta_{{1}} {\\text{X}}_{{1}} + \\, \\beta_{{2}} {\\text{X}}_{{2}} + \\, \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots . + \\, \\beta_{{\\text{n}}} {\\text{X}}_{{{\\text{ni}}}} + {\\text{U}}_{{\\text{i}}}$$\n(5)\nAfter deriving the predicted probability values conditional on the observable covariates (the propensity scores) from the binary estimation, matching was performed using a matching algorithm chosen according to the characteristics of the data. Thus (\nY\n) is specified as:\n$$\\tau \\, = {\\text{ Y}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\left( {{\\text{D}}_{{\\text{i}}} = { 1}} \\right) \\, {-}{\\text{ Y}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\left( {{\\text{D}}_{{\\text{i}}} = \\, 0} \\right)$$\n(6)\nwhere τ represents the treatment effect (the effect of participation in UA as CSA),\nY\ni\ndenotes the outcome for household i, and\nD\ni\nindicates whether household i received the treatment (i.e., participated in UA as CSA).\nIt is important to note that Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 1) and Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 0) cannot be simultaneously observed for the same household. Depending on the household's treatment status (participation in UA as CSA), either Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 1) or Y\ni\n(D\ni\n= 0) will be an unobserved outcome, referred to as the counterfactual outcome. Consequently, estimating the individual treatment effect τi is not feasible, necessitating a shift to estimating average treatment effects at the population level rather than the individual level. The most commonly used average treatment effect estimation is the 'average treatment effect on the treated (τATT),' specified as follows.\n$$\\tau {\\text{ATT }} = {\\text{ E}}(\\tau /{\\text{D }} = 1) = {\\text{ E}}\\left[ {{\\text{Y}}_{\\left( 1 \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 1 - {\\text{E}}{\\text{Y}}_{\\left( {\\text{O}} \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 1} \\right]$$\n(7)\nSince the counterfactual mean for those receiving the treatment, (E[Y(1) | D = 1]), is unobserved, an appropriate substitute must be chosen to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). One might consider using the mean outcome of the untreated individuals, (E[Y(0) | D = 0]), as a proxy for the counterfactual mean for those being treated, (E[Y(0) | D = 1]). However, this approach is flawed, particularly in non-experimental studies, because the factors influencing the treatment decision are likely to also affect the outcome variable. In this specific context, the variables influencing households’ decisions to participate in UA as CSA participants could also affect input use intensity, productivity levels, farmers’ income, and consequently, food security status. Therefore, the outcomes for individuals in the treatment and comparison groups would differ even in the absence of treatment, leading to self-selection bias. By rearranging and subtracting (E[Y(0) | D = 0]) from both sides, one can derive the following specification for:\n$${\\text{ATT}}.{\\text{E}}\\left[ {{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}_{\\left( 1 \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 1 - {\\text{ E}}\\left( {{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}_{ \\left( 0 \\right)}/{\\text{D }} = 0} \\right)} \\right] = \\tau {\\text{ATT}} - {\\text{ E}}\\left[ {{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}-{\\left( 1 \\right)}{\\text{ }}/{\\text{D}}\\,{\\text{ = 1}} - {\\text{E}}{\\text{Y}}{\\mkern 1mu}_{\\left( 0 \\right)}/{\\text{D}} = 0} \\right]$$\n(8)\nBoth terms on the left-hand side are observables, and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) can be identified if and only if (E[Y(0) \\mid D = 0]—E[Y(0) \\mid D = 1] = 0), indicating an absence of self-selection bias. This condition is met exclusively in social experiments where treatments are randomly assigned to units, thereby eliminating self-selection bias. In non-experimental studies, however, it is necessary to introduce certain identifying assumptions to address the selection problem.\n2.7\nDefinition of variables\nUA adoption is the Logit model dependent variable. Food security from UA practice is the outcome. Previous study and study conditions determine independent variables. Age, gender, education, employment status, household monthly income, family size, land size, perception of UA, credit access, training and support, home ownership, market demand, and household location are independent variables.\n2.7.1\nDependent variable\nUA practice: This study treated it as a dummy variable, giving it a value of “1” for “adopters” and “0” for “non-adopters”.\n2.7.2\nOutcome variables\nFood security is another dummy variable with values of 1 for secure and 0 for insecure. Intake is determined by calories (food consumption recall survey module/food diary). Independent variables.\nAge of the household head (AGHH)\n: The variable is continuous and measured in years. Based on prior research, this characteristic may positively or negatively affect UA adoption as CSA [\n30\n]. Younger/older farmers may be less inclined to embrace UA because to a lack of information. If the family head is within the productive age, the variable should boost UA adoption.\nCredit access (CRAC)\n: A dummy variable, it represents 1 if the household has credit and 0 otherwise. If they have financing, farmers can participate in UA, whereas others without it may struggle to accept technology [\n37\n].\nEducational status of household head (EDHH)\n: This continuous variable measures years of schooling. Adopters' household heads had more years of schooling than non-adopters, which helped them understand the relevance of UA practices [\n41\n]. Education is considered to make UA adoption more likely, but illiteracy reduces adoption due to a lack of understanding or awareness. Thus, this variable may effect adoption. According to Ibrahim et al. [\n29\n], household education drives UA adoption.\nFamily size (FAMSZ)\n: Family size is a continuous variable. According to various studies [\n20\n,\n30\n] household size can affect technology adoption. UA is more likely to be pursued by larger households [\n30\n]. This may be due to family help, which may boost UA adoption.\nHousehold Location (HHLO\n): Location of the household is a categorical variable evaluated by HH location differences. The model presents ρ\n1\nfor households not near the market, ρ\n2\nfor moderate fare households, ρ\n3\nfor near households, and ρ\n4\nfor in-market families. Regional differences can affect farmer adoption [\n35\n].\nJob status of household head (JSHH)\n: The dummy variable 0 represents job seekers and 1 represents employed people. In this sense, \"job\" means a salaried position where a person does tasks for money. A \"job seeker\" is an unemployed person actively seeking work. This term applies regardless of employment market or geography. This characteristic may hinder UA uptake [\n21\n]. Because households with other income-generating jobs are less likely to undertake UA practices, thus, it may negatively impact UA engagement.\nLand size (LASZ)\n: This continuous variable, measured in hectares, has a positive link with UA adoption. Increasing land size improves the likelihood of UA. This is because households with vast plots of land can practice any UA. Hu et al. [\n28\n] found that land size boosts agricultural technology adoption. Therefore, this variable should positively and significantly affect UA uptake.\nMarket demand (MKTDD)\n: A dummy variable with one if they assume increased agricultural product demand and zero otherwise. UA attracts farmers due to rising demand [\n24\n]. Thus, rising market demand may boost engagement.\nMonthly income of the household (MOINHH)\n: Continuous variable measured in Ethiopian birr. Urban agricultural engagement is projected to decrease significantly with this variable. The negative effects of this variable are due to the fact that households with higher monthly incomes are less likely to farm in urban areas.\nOwnership of living home (OWLHO)\n: This dummy variable is 1 if the household owns a home and 0 otherwise. Homeownership improves household well-being and adoption [\n50\n].\nHousehold perception of urban agriculture (PHUA)\n: It is a dummy variable that assumes one if UA reduces purchase costs (UA benefits) and zero otherwise. Thus, positive perception of UA may increase engagement. UA can be improved by promoting healthy eating and reducing food costs [\n24\n].\nGender of household head (GEHH)\n: This variable is binary, indicating whether the household head is male or female. One element affecting new product uptake is gender. Men have more opportunity to leave home and participate in developmental programmes than women, so they can learn more about technology. Female urban farmers predominate [\n30\n]. This study hypothesizes that male farmers are more likely to practice UA.\nTraining and support (TRSU)\n: A continuous variable measuring the number of government and NGO training and support for UA for the HH. Training helps households adopt technology. Training and support should increase engagement, according to the hypothesis.\n3\nResult\n3.1\nSocio demographic and economic characteristics of sample households\nThe findings showed that 53.53% of the 384 sample homes' respondents were engaging in UA, whereas the remaining 46.47% respondents were not (Table\n1\n). The various factors influencing the acceptance of UA as CSA were succinctly summarized in the accompanying table. Tables\n1\nand\n2\nshow the results of a comparison between those who adopted and did not embrace UA as CSA by using the chi-square-test (for dummy variables) and the t-test (for continuous variables). The statistical analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in mean values between individuals who adopted and those who did not adopt, specifically in relation to job position, perception towards UA, and family size. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean values of the remaining variables between individuals who adopted and those who did not adopt.\nTable 1 Dummy variables pertaining to sample homes' socio-demographic characteristics\nFull size table\nTable 2 Continuous variables pertaining to sample families' socio-demographic and economic characteristics\nFull size table\nJob status is among the most important determining factors for participating in UA. The survey result showed that 37.05% of the total sample households had paying jobs. From sample households having paying jobs, 17.05% of them were practicing UA while the remaining 20% were not practicing UA (Table\n2\n). The survey result indicated that 22.3% sample households believed UA can reduce the cost of buying whereas the remaining of them was not (Table\n2\n). Family size is the most important labor inputs for every farming activity and the survey result indicated the average family size of sample households who adopt the UA was 4.6 while 4 for non-adopters (Table\n2\n).\n3.2\nEconometric analysis\n3.2.1\nFactors affecting the adoption of UA\nThe logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the likelihood ratio test was highly significant at the 1% level (\np\n≤ 0.005), suggesting that the independent variables possess robust explanatory capabilities regarding the determinants influencing the uptake of UA, as evidenced by the model's goodness of fit. The empirical outcomes of the model elucidated that variables such as household size, homeownership status, employment status of the household head, perceptions of UA, market demand, and the presence of training and support from government or non-governmental organizations exert a statistically significant impact on the propensity to adopt urban agricultural practices, as detailed in Table\n3\n.\nTable 3 Logistic regression result on the determinants of UA practices as CSA\nFull size table\n3.2.2\nImpact of urban agriculture on food security\nThe investigation employed PSM to ascertain the influence of urban agriculture implementation on the food security status of the sampled households. The study meticulously computed the propensity scores, selected an appropriate matching algorithm, and conducted a thorough balance check to ensure comparability between the treated and control groups. Subsequently, the study rigorously assessed the impact of urban agriculture on food security, thereby providing empirical insights into its effectiveness.\n3.3\nPropensity score estimation\nThe propensity scores were estimated using a logit model, taking into account the fitness for estimation and careful evaluation of the assumptions of PSM. The estimated propensity score (PS) was used to establish the common support region, which was determined by statistical study of those who adopted urban agriculture and those who did not. The common support zone was identified by selecting the lowest value among the highest scores and the highest value among the lowest scores for the propensity scores of both groups. The common support region ranged from 0.042 (the lowest maximum value) to 0.991(the highest minimum value) of the propensity score (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n1\n). Hence, 58 observations (consisting of 35 adopters and 23 non-adopters) were removed from the impact analysis sections due to the overlap requirement.\nIn the quest to discern the treatment's impact, post-estimation of propensity scores, the treated group's values were juxtaposed with those of the control group members exhibiting analogous propensity scores. The matching methodology encompassed a spectrum of techniques, including nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, and kernel matching. The selection of the superior matching algorithm was predicated on several criteria; the mean bias, the tally of matched observations, the count of balanced covariates, and the magnitude of the pseudo\nR\n-squared. An optimal match is characterized by the minimal mean standardized bias, the most reduced pseudo\nR\n-squared, a comparable number of matched observations, an equivalent count of balanced covariates relative to alternative algorithms, a substantial overall bias diminution, and non-significant\np\n-values in the likelihood ratio test subsequent to matching. Hence, researcher computed the mean bias, the quantity of matched observations, the number of balanced variables, and the pseudo\nR\n-squared value (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n2\n). Employing these metrics, nearest neighbor matching emerged as the paramount technique for aligning the treatment units (adopters) with the control group (non-adopters), thereby facilitating the evaluation of urban agriculture adoption's ramifications via PSM.\nUpon the completion of the matching procedure, the matched units within the adopter and non-adopter cohorts were rendered statistically indistinguishable. The t-test was utilized to compare the means of all variables included in the propensity score, thereby evaluating the mean equivalence between the two cohorts (adopters and non-adopters). The analysis indicated that the mean difference for any given covariate between the cohorts was less than 25%, with the overall absolute mean bias registering at 3.1%, comfortably within the acceptable range of 2 to 5%. The exhaustive balancing test substantiated the absence of significant differences in the variables post-matching, corroborated by the non-significant results in the chi-squared test (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n3\n), thereby affirming the methodological soundness of the matching process.\n3.4\nEstimation of average treatment effect\nAfter balance verification, the average treatment effect (ATE) was calculated by averaging the result discrepancies between each treated (adoption) unit and its control (non-adoption) group. It was interpreted as how urban agriculture affects food security. The ATE's influence on adopters was assessed using nearest neighbor matching. A bootstrapping method with 100 replications was used to estimate matching estimator standard errors, which adjust for the calculated propensity score.\nResults show no change in the impact of urban agriculture, even with treatment chances varying up to eγ = 2.5. The predicted outcome variable has significant p-values at different values of the threshold value of eγ (\nSupplementary file\n: Table\n4\n). This suggests that the study considered relevant factors that affected participation and outcome variables. Therefore, this study's outcome variable impact estimates (ATT) were not subject to unobserved selection bias.\nTable 4 Impact of adopting urban agriculture on household food security\nFull size table\n4\nDiscussion\n4.1\nDescriptive results discussion\nEmployment status emerges as a pivotal determinant in the engagement with urban agriculture. The data reveals that a majority of the surveyed households, approximately 63%, were without paid employment. This indicates a high level of unemployment or underemployment within the community. Among these households, 36.47% were found to have adopted urban agriculture as a form of climate-smart agriculture, compared to 26.47% who did not engage in urban agriculture. This suggests that there is a higher propensity for urban agriculture adoption among households lacking formal employment.\nOne possible reason for this trend could be the economic benefits that urban agriculture can provide for households without paid employment. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, urban agriculture can serve as a source of income and food security for families who may struggle to find formal employment opportunities. By growing their own food and selling surplus produce, households can supplement their income and improve their economic situation. Additionally, urban agriculture can provide a sense of empowerment and self-sufficiency for households without paid employment. By growing their own food and taking control of their food production, households can reduce their dependence on external sources for food and resources. This can lead to increased resilience in the face of economic challenges and fluctuations.\nThe statistically significant difference observed at the 5% level between urban agriculture adopters and non-adopters in terms of job status further supports the idea that households lacking formal employment are more likely to engage in urban agriculture. This finding aligns with previous study by Ofordu et al. [\n44\n], which found that a substantial proportion of urban farmers were either self-employed or apprentices. This suggests a growing trend towards urban agriculture among individuals outside of the formal employment sector.\nOverall, the data indicates that urban agriculture can serve as a valuable and sustainable livelihood option for households without paid employment. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, by adopting urban agriculture as a form of climate-smart agriculture, these households can improve their economic situation, food security, and overall resilience in the face of economic challenges.\nPerception of UA as a CSA can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, urban agriculture can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By producing food locally and reducing the need for long-distance transportation, urban agriculture can help lower carbon emissions associated with food production and distribution.\nAdditionally, urban agriculture can contribute to climate change adaptation by providing a source of local, resilient food production. In times of extreme weather events or disruption in global food supply chains, urban agriculture can serve as a valuable resource for communities to access fresh, locally grown produce. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, urban agriculture can act as a cost-reduction strategy for households by providing access to affordable, fresh produce. By growing their own food in urban spaces, households can save money on grocery bills and reduce their reliance on expensive, processed foods.\nThe significant differences in perception towards urban agriculture as a CSA between adopters and non-adopters could be due to a variety of reasons. Adopters may have had firsthand experience with the benefits of urban agriculture, such as cost savings and access to fresh produce, leading to a more positive perception of its role as a climate-smart agriculture. Non-adopters, on the other hand, may have preconceived notions about urban agriculture as a less effective or sustainable form of food production. The evolution of urban agriculture from traditional backyard farming to a more structured and professional domain is a positive development. This shift not only enhances the credibility and viability of urban agriculture as a sustainable food production system but also aligns with broader community enhancement and environmental greening initiatives. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, by integrating urban agriculture into urban planning and development strategies, cities can harness its potential to improve food security, promote sustainable practices, and enhance community resilience.\nThe recognition of urban agriculture as a CSA and cost-reduction strategy reflects the growing significance of this practice in addressing key societal challenges, such as food insecurity and climate change. By continuing to support and promote urban agriculture initiatives, policymakers, researchers, and communities can leverage its potential to create more resilient, sustainable, and equitable food systems in urban areas.\nFurthermore, the analysis indicated a higher likelihood of urban agriculture adoption in households with larger family sizes. The mean family size difference between adopters and non-adopters was statistically significant at the 5% level, with the average household comprising 5.7 individuals. The finding that households with larger family sizes are more likely to adopt urban agriculture as a CSA practice can be attributed to several reasons. First, in larger families, there is likely a greater need for food production to feed all family members. Urban agriculture can provide a source of fresh fruits and vegetables that supplement the household's food supply, potentially reducing food insecurity. Additionally, larger families may have more hands available to help with the labor-intensive activities associated with urban agriculture, such as planting, watering, and harvesting crops. This can contribute to higher adoption rates among households with larger family sizes.\nThe observation that urban agriculture practices are more prevalent among smaller families can be explained by the time commitments associated with urban agriculture. Larger families often have more responsibilities, such as childcare, that require a significant amount of time and attention. As a result, the labor availability for urban agriculture activities may be limited in larger families, leading to lower adoption rates. Smaller families, on the other hand, may have more flexibility and time to dedicate to urban agriculture practices, making them more likely to adopt these sustainable agricultural practices.\nThe findings from this analysis have important implications for designing effective policies and programs to promote urban agriculture adoption as a CSA practice. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, policymakers and program implementers should consider the size of the household when developing strategies to promote urban agriculture, as larger families may require additional support and resources to overcome barriers to adoption. Additionally, efforts to promote urban agriculture among smaller families should focus on highlighting the potential time savings and benefits of engaging in these practices, to encourage greater uptake among this demographic. Overall, understanding the relationship between family size and urban agriculture adoption can help inform targeted interventions to promote sustainable agriculture practices in urban settings. This is consistent with Nigus et al. [\n41\n], who reported average family sizes of 5.54 for adopters and 6.06 for non-adopters. Interestingly, urban agriculture practices were more prevalent among smaller families, a finding significant at the 1% level. This may be attributable to the time commitments associated with urban agriculture,larger families often allocate more time to childcare, potentially compromising the labor availability for urban agriculture activities.\n4.2\nDiscussion of the factors affecting the adoption of urban agriculture\nFamily size\nNumber of household members positively and significantly affects urban agriculture participation as climate smart agriculture (CSA). This indicates that urban agriculture is more common in households with more people. The study found that if a household adds one person, the odds ratio for urban agriculture increases by 0.38 units, holding other variables constant. This shows that larger households are more likely to farm urban.\nDanso-Abbeam et al. [\n16\n] also discovered a favorable association between household size and organic cotton adoption. Other study conducted Ida Naziera et al. [\n30\n] discovered that urban residents with larger households are more likely to consider urban agriculture. Due to more family members helping out, larger households can better manage and maintain urban agriculture methods. The number of household members affects the chance of climate-smart urban agriculture. Family support makes larger households more likely to participate in urban agriculture.\nOwnership of living home\n: A 10% significance level was found for home ownership in defining urban agriculture as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). When other variables are held equal, households with their own living residence are 0.71 times more likely to adopt CSA varieties. This supports Kaliba et al. [\n33\n], who reported a positive correlation between home ownership and technology adoption. According to  Zeng et al. [\n61\n], home ownership improves household well-being and technology adoption. Ownership of a living home may bring stability and security, making people more likely to participate in urban agriculture. Owning a home can encourage sustainable behaviors like CSA and improve household welfare and community resilience.\nJob status of HH head\n: The occupational position of the household head negatively impacted the adoption of climate-smart urban agriculture. The likelihood of urban agriculture adoption decreased by 0.95 for those with their own residences. This contradicts Ibrahim et al. [\n29\n], who showed a positive and substantial effect of work status on urban agriculture practices. This may be because households with other income-generating jobs have less time for urban agriculture. Job seekers may also turn to urban agriculture for cash. Governments often use urban agriculture to create jobs.\nPerception toward urban agriculture\n: At 1% significance level, this variable proved important in defining urban agriculture as CSA practices. Households that consider urban agriculture can cut buying costs are 1.74 times more likely to adopt these types, assuming other variables remain constant. Ida Naziera et al. [\n30\n] discovered that urban agriculture reduces fresh food costs and promotes healthy eating.\nMarket demand\n: Market demand was found to be major variables in urban agriculture CSA adoption at 10% level, with an odd ratio in favour of adoption greater by 0.82 for households that predict a growing demand for agricultural products. Urban agriculture attracts farmers due to rising demand [\n24\n].\nTraining and support\n: This variable significantly affected urban agriculture CSA decision-making at 1% significance level. Keeping other variables equal, the odds ratio in favour of urban agriculture would improve by 0.35 if the household received one more training and support. Training helps households adopt technology.\nTraining and support are crucial factors in promoting the adoption of urban agriculture as climate-smart agriculture. The findings suggest that when individuals receive training and support, they are more likely to engage in urban agriculture practices. This highlights the importance of providing education and assistance to households to help them understand the benefits of urban agriculture and how to implement it effectively.\nTraining can provide households with the knowledge and skills needed to successfully practice urban agriculture, including techniques for sustainable farming and climate-smart practices [\n42\n]. Support, on the other hand, can provide resources, guidance, and encouragement to help households overcome challenges and effectively implement urban agriculture practices.\nThe significant relationship between training and support and the decision to practice urban agriculture underscores the importance of investing in educational programs and resources for individuals interested in urban agriculture. By providing training and support, policymakers and organizations can help increase awareness, build capacity, and facilitate the adoption of CSA practices in urban areas.\nOverall, training and support play a critical role in promoting the adoption of urban agriculture as a sustainable and environmentally friendly practice. By investing in education and assistance for households, we can help create a more resilient and climate-smart agricultural system in urban areas.\n4.3\nDiscussion of impact of urban agriculture on food security\nAccording to the results, at a 1% significance level, the average treatment effect on the treated was noteworthy. This suggests that the implementation of urban agriculture has a significant effect on food security. Specifically, if farmers engage in urban agriculture, the probability of achieving food security would improve by a factor of 0.685, all other factors remaining constant.\nThere are several reasons why the adoption of urban agriculture as climate smart agriculture can have a significant impact on food security. Urban agriculture allows for the production of a variety of crops in smaller spaces, providing a more diverse range of food options for residents. This can help to address issues of food insecurity by ensuring a steady and diverse supply of fresh produce. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, climate smart agriculture practices, such as water conservation and soil management techniques, can help urban farmers adapt to changing weather patterns and extreme weather events. This can help to ensure a more reliable food supply, even in the face of climate-related challenges.\nUrban agriculture can reduce the distance food needs to travel from farm to plate, resulting in fresher and more nutritious produce for urban residents. This can help to improve dietary quality and overall health, contributing to food security. Urban agriculture can provide opportunities for income generation and employment for urban residents, particularly in low-income communities. This can help to alleviate poverty and improve food security by increasing access to nutritious foods. In addition, the findings from KIIs and FGD revealed that, the adoption of urban agriculture as climate smart agriculture can have far-reaching benefits for food security, by improving access to fresh and diverse foods, increasing resilience to climate change, and creating economic opportunities for urban residents.\nA study conducted in Malaysia by Ida Naziera [\n30\n] demonstrated that engaging in urban agriculture can establish a robust and compelling basis for Malaysians to mitigate the effects of food scarcity and climate change. The outcome is consistent with the discoveries of Jaleta et al. [\n31\n]. Furthermore, the implementation of urban agriculture had notable impacts on the participants' livelihoods, specifically in terms of enhancing their standard of living and promoting a more efficient saving behavior [\n4\n]. In order to check to what extent the study was free from bias resulting from unobserved variable sensitivity analysis was undertaken.\n5\nConclusion and recommendation\nThe descriptive analysis showed that about 53.53% of the respondents were adopters’ urban agriculture. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the importance of urban agriculture as a climate-smart agricultural practice in enhancing food security in Wolaita Sodo city, South Ethiopia. The results demonstrate that UA adoption is influenced by various factors such as family size, home ownership, household head's occupation, perceptions of UA, market demand, and access to training and support. Moreover, the study reveals that UA significantly contributes to improving food security, with adopters being more likely to achieve food security compared to non-adopters. It is imperative for local authorities to implement educational programs and provide support to cooperative entities to promote the adoption of UA and combat food insecurity in urban areas. Overall, urban agriculture emerges as a promising solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure sustainable food production for urban populations.\nTherefore, the government should do a lot to engage the job seeker in to urban agriculture by providing training improve their perception and entrepreneur skill. Urban consumers, especially poor consumers, should be able to make refined decisions about food production, processing, storage, preparation, and distribution in order to make the best possible choices. Beside, policymakers should be aware of the advantages of UA. The demands and advantages of UA should be taken into consideration when physical planning (land tenure, water availability, drainage, etc.) is done.\n6\nLimitation of the study and direction for future research\nLimitations of this study include the reliance on a cross-sectional study design, which may limit the ability to establish causality between urban agriculture adoption and food security outcomes. Additionally, the study was conducted in a specific geographic area, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other locations. Furthermore, the study focused on the perceptions of UA adopters and non-adopters, but did not delve into the perspectives of other stakeholders such as government officials, agricultural experts, or community members.\nDirections for future study could include longitudinal studies to explore the long-term impact of urban agriculture on food security outcomes. Comparative studies could also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of different UA practices in diverse urban settings. Additionally, study could investigate the potential role of policies and programs in promoting climate-smart agricultural practices such as UA. Lastly, qualitative study methods could be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the motivations and obstacles faced by individuals and households in adopting UA practices. The study also suggested the adoption of inter- and Trans disciplinary study strategies, and a critical approach to urban agriculture practices. In addition to promoting practitioner-researcher collaboration, it is important to aid urban farmers in their efforts to continue producing safe, nutrient-rich goods for both personal consumption and city markets. Ultimately, sustainable assessment of urban agriculture may be a preprint to support agriculture in urban and peri-urban spaces.\nData availability\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nCode availability\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbduselam Abdulahi M.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Determinants of adoption of urban agriculture (UA) as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and its impact on food security: evidence from Wolaita Sodo city, South Ethiopia\" presents a comprehensive investigation into how urban agriculture can enhance food security. The authors, Mamush Masha, Elias Bojago, and Innocent Ngare, argue that urban agriculture plays a significant role in addressing food security, especially in urban settings where access to nutritious food can be limited. The focus on climate-smart practices further underscores the dual role urban agriculture can play in mitigating the impacts of climate change while contributing to food availability and affordability. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The paper directly supports the claim that \"Urban agriculture improves food security\" through empirical investigation. It reveals that UA not only provides a viable source of nutritious food but also offers economic benefits, especially for marginalized populations. In reference to food security, the paper highlights that urban agriculture practices enable households to grow their own food, which decreases reliance on cheaper, less nutritious commercial options. This autonomy in food production is crucial for improving food security in urban areas characterized by high poverty levels and uneven access to food resources.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The authors utilized a mixed-methods approach, employing qualitative and quantitative data to assess the determinants influencing UA adoption and its resultant effects on food security. Data was gathered from a sample of 384 urban households in Wolaita Sodo City using structured questionnaires, ensuring that both statistical significance and contextual understanding were achieved. The sample size is adequate for drawing conclusions about the urban agricultural landscape in the specific study area. The use of both primary and secondary data increases the reliability of findings, while the structured questionnaires allow for fair comparisons among various respondents. However, the study could have benefited from longitudinal data to better assess the ongoing impact of urban agriculture on food security over time.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The study concludes by emphasizing that urban agriculture is not merely a cultivation method but also a strategic imperative for enhancing food security in urban settings. It suggests that promoting UA could substantially alleviate food insecurity by providing a consistent and fresh source of produce. The findings also indicate a strong correlation between the adoption of climate-smart practices and an increase in food security indicators. This outcome is significant as it highlights the potential health and economic benefits of UA in combating the adverse effects of climate change and market fluctuations, asserting its role as a crucial factor in sustainable urban development.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: While the paper is robust, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. One potential bias is the focus on a single city, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other urban contexts with different socio-economic variables. Additionally, the research relies on self-reported data, which can lead to bias in responses related to food security experiences and perceptions. The authors acknowledge this limitation, suggesting that future research should incorporate diverse urban settings and longitudinal studies to validate the findings on a broader scale and draw more comprehensive conclusions about the role of urban agriculture in food security.",

IntroductionCrop production and livestock keeping are part of the food security system in the urban areas of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They directly provide food and indirectly generate household cash income. A study by Drescher (1994) revealed that close to 40 percent of households in Lusaka, Zambia, relied on the urban environment to gather, or grow, food for home consumption and sale. Lee-Smith (1991) reported that a 1985 study in Nairobi, Kenya, showed that 29 percent of Nairobi households grew craps and 17 percent raised livestock with a total value of US$17 million. In 1991 Mbiba assessed urban agriculture comprising of dairy cows, maize, sheep and pigs in Maseru, Lesotho, at close to US$13 million (Mbiba, 1995).Work in Lusaka by Rakodi (1987) and Sanyal (1987), Mosha (1991) in Tanzania and Freeman (1992) in Nairobi underscored the importance of urban agriculture as source of food and income for low-income households. Mudimu and Chigume (1993) measured the contribution of cultivation on open spaces to household food security and cash income in the City of Harare, Zimbabwe. Maize from these sources provided grain that lasted up to 4 months for some of the households. These translated into savings on household food expenditure (maize grain purchases) of up to US$15 per month. This is substantial for households whose breadwinners are on minimum wage of US$100-250 per month and facing food basket needs of US$20-40 per month.The advent of economic reforms, in the mid-1980, led to removal of subsidies on food commodities and retrenchments in the formal employment sectors. These have, in turn, contributed to fall in real incomes and a reduced food security status of many urban households.The vulnerable households have resorted to urban agriculture to grow food crops to sustain their livelihood.Despite being a widespread practice and its importance, urban agriculture is not considered a legitimate form of urban land use, thus it is not planned for, nor supported by urban planners and managers (Rogerson, 1993; Mbiba, 1994). The reaction of local authorities has been repressive especially in Eastern and Southern Africa (Mbiba, 1994).Urban agriculture is an issue of debate due to the different perceptions and interpretations of its value and importance by urban planners and managers versus those engaged in the activity. Conflicts in urban land use for food production arise from the different perceptions and interpretations of its value and importance by urban planners and managers versus those engaged in the activity. The former do not recognised it as a legitimate use of the urban environment (Mazambani, 1982). Urban agriculture has not therefore been incorporated in urban planning and neither is it supported (Lee-Smith and Trujilo, 1992, Rogers, 1993). It comes into conflict with the provisions of urban space planning and management. Repressive measures were often adopted to control the situation as illustrated by the actions of the Harare City Council prior to 1992 and other cases reported by Freeman (1991), Lee-Smith and Trujilo (1992), and Mbiba (1995). Those involved in urban agriculture contend that it provides an opportunity for households to improve availability of own produced foods and cash income.This paper contributes to previous research on urban agriculture in Harare. Its contribution is to empirically measure the economics of urban agriculture, linkages with the economic structural adjustment programme (ESAP) and assess the views of the cultivators on the areas of conflicts and attitudes towards urban agriculture.The paper has seven sections, inclusive of the introduction. The second section discusses the issues of urban agriculture in Harare. The third and fourth sections report the findings of the case study that examines the contribution of urban agriculture to urban population’s strategy to maintain household food and cash income security in the environment of economic reforms. The linkage between economic reforms and increase in cultivation on urban spaces is presented in section five. Section six presents the cultivators’ views on urban agriculture, alternative land use and their awareness of environmental issues. The last section synthesizes the issues.2. Urban Agriculture in HarareUrban Harare covers 55 600 hectares, of which about 10 000 hectares are undeveloped residential and industrial lands and open lands (Mazambani, 1982). The open lands include stream banks, wet lands (which are regulated by the Natural Resources Act of 1975), road and rail reserves and land reserved for recreational and other purposes. It is estimated that 50-60 percent of the undeveloped and open land is under cultivation (Masoka, 1995). Between 1950 and 1980, the area under cultivation increased by 68 percent (Mazambani, 1982) and by 93 percent between 1990 and 1994 (Masoka, 1995). This massive increase is attributed to a number of factors. One factor is the rapid urban population growth since 1980. A second factor is the worsening economic conditions from the mid-1980s coupled with a general increase in commodity prices, especially food. The practice of urban agriculture increased markedly during the post-1991 years due to the economic hardships brought about by the economic structural adjustment programme initiated in 1991. This included cost recovery measures in health and education. These hardships resulted in many urban families turning to urban cultivation as an alternative source of food, to save on food expenditure and raise cash income.2.1 Rules, Regulations on Urban AgricultureThe Regional Town and Country Planning Act that governs urban planning and management refer to urban agriculture as one of the development activities that is subject to control through statutory instruments. The Urban Council Act, that governs local authorities, gives the2responsible minister discretion to make regulations pertaining to cultivated urban lands. It, however, does not necessarily prohibit urban agriculture. The Act gives power to the responsible minister to clear crops when they are likely to cause fire, or health problems, or if they are unsightly. All these are subjective. Both Acts do not necessarily prohibit urban cultivation on open spaces in the cities.There is no clear policy against, or in support, or plans relating to urban agriculture of urban agriculture. Past control measures such as slashing of crops were justified on the basis of the Natural Resource Act that controls, or prohibits, cultivation inside 30 metres of riverbanks, or other waterways.2.2 Land Use Conflicts and Environmental IssuesLocal authorities view urban agriculture as demanding a significant proportion of cities’ land and having negative environmental and health impacts. The general attitude has been either to deter or to stop the agricultural activity from continuing. The reasons given include: (a) soil erosion which eventually results in silting water sources; (b) negating the provision of open areas which should be used for recreation by residents, (c) re-pegging areas because the boundary pegs were removed by cultivators and (d) the arguments that tall maize plants provide hideaway for muggers. Bowyer-Bower and Tengbeh (1995) measured the environmental effects of urban agriculture on the environment of Harare. They assessed that in cultivated areas the infiltration of rainwater into the soil was reduced on average by 28.5 percent. Soil loss in cultivated lands ranged from 2.5 to 13.7 tonnes per hectare per year, depending on soil type. Cultivation of open spaces and wet lands contributed to loss or change in spatial diversity of species habitat of over 80 percent, reduction of ecological diversity and contributed to a 55 percent loss in tree presence in Harare (Bowyer-Bower and Tengbeh, 1995). These changes contributed to some decline in the aesthetic quality of urban space. All the above changes impact negatively on quality of urban life and increase costs of urban management.Those involved in urban agriculture contend that it provides opportunities for households to improve availability of own produced foods and cash income and reduces the vulnerability of women and children to food insecurity and negative impacts of the economic reforms (Mbiba, 1995). Most participants are low-income urban residents who grow crops to supplement disposable incomes through savings in food purchases. This frees their budgets for other household needs. In addition, it contributes to better family nutrition that would not have been possible if the family purchased all requirements from the market. Improved nutrition contributes to better family health. It could therefore be argued that if cultivators had more influence on urban land use planning in local authorities, they would make provisions for urban cultivation.2.3 City Council Control ApproachesThe City Council of Harare mounted a campaign against urban agriculture and slashed maturing crops, in 1990 and 1991, in an attempt to stop agricultural activities. The response of the cultivators, the majority who were women, was to fight what they considered to be a colonial and male attitude to city planning with regard to alternative urban land uses. This opposition was articulated as a political and economic battle The women mobilised themselves to lobby their local city councillors and their constituent Members of Parliament for a general change in attitude towards urban agriculture. They contended that they needed the land to grow crops to supplement incomes and food supplies. In their view the open and undeveloped urban lands were under utilised. They resisted and opposed the City Council by continuing their agricultural practice year after year. In response to this persistence and the accompanying political pressure, in 1992 the Harare City Council conceded by allocating some designated land to women operating through organised groups. The groups then formed farming co-operatives. This option gave some residents the right to grow their crops and for the City Council to allocate suitable land and be able to monitor and control the impacts of some urban cultivation. Despite this move, “illegal”, or un-sanctioned, cultivation by both members of co-operatives, who have plots outside the identified co-operative lands, and other individuals, who are not members of co-operatives, has persisted. Over the period 1992 to 1995, there has been extensive expansion in the area under cultivation. The demand for land exceeds the supply.33. Case StudyThe case study analyses the socio-economics of urban cultivation in terms of the cultivators’ socio-economic characteristics, contribution to food security and the examines the cultivators’ views, attitudes and perceptions of the use of the urban space for agricultural activities and related issues. The case study draws from a larger study undertaken in January 1995 to February 1997 to characterise and quantify agricultural activities on open and undeveloped land areas around Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city.3.1 Data Sources3.1.1 Selection of Survey SitesTwo methods were used to select the survey sites. A rapid survey of all the open and undeveloped lands was undertaken to identify the extent of cultivation within the boundaries of Harare in December 1995 at the onset of the rainfall season. The observations made were compared with information from aerial photographs taken in 1993 and 1994 to identify sites where cultivation had expanded. On the basis of these observations, nine sites were purposively selected for the survey. Seven sites were in, or around, the high-density low-income suburbs of Dzivaresekwa, Hatcliffe, Sunningdale, Mufakose, Tafara, Mabvuku, and Warren Park. Two sites were within the low-density middle income suburbs of Mabelreign and Ashdown Park.3.1.2 Sample SelectionThere was no population list of individuals, or households, involved in urban cultivation from which to select a sample for the survey. It was decided to interview persons found working in the cultivated plots between 06.00 and 11.00 hours on the day the survey site was visited. This time period is when most operators undertake their cultivation activities. One day was allocated to each survey site. In situations where a group, or family members, were working together, only one person, indicated as either the owner, or operator, or responsible child, or adult was interviewed. Eight research assistants conducted the interviews using a structured questionnaire. A total of 520 persons were interviewed over a 10-day period. Most of the interviewees regarded the study as an opportunity to air their views on urban cultivation. Five persons refused to be interviewed.Table 1 Profile of Respondents by Survey Sites and GenderFemale MaleSurvey Sites No. (%) No. (%)Dzivaresekwa 34 (74) 12 (26)Hatcliffe 29 (64) 16(36)Sunningdale 43(61) 28 (39)Mufakose 32 (49) 34 (52)Tafara 50 (62) 31 (38)Mabvuku 16 (52) 15(48)Warren Park 19 (63) 11 (37)Ashdown Park 33 (40) 50 (60)Mabelreign 10 (37) 17(63)Total 266 (55) 214 (45)3.2 ResultsDue to missing data, there were 480 usable questionnaires from the 520 respondents. As the number interviewed was not based on a representative sample of all cultivators in Harare, the results may not be generalised for Harare, let alone other urban areas in Zimbabwe. The results are, however, indicative. Table 1 lists the respondents by survey sites.4The results elaborate on the socio-economic characteristics of the individuals interviewed their motivation for, assessment and perception of the issues surrounding urban agriculture. The analysis is based on descriptive statistics.3.2.1 Socio-economic Profile o f Respondents3.2.1.1 Household SizeTable 2 Respondents’ Household SizeHousehold size RespondentsNumber %0 no family 46 9.61 - 3 75 15.64 - 6 207 43.17 - 9 125 26.01 0 -1 8 27 5.6Mean 5.225 100Mode 5.0The average household size was 5.2 persons. This was made up of family members and kin. Twenty-six (26) percent lived in households of 7-9 persons and about 6 percent in households of 10-18 persons (Table 2). A relatively small percentage, 2 percent, of households consisted of more than 13 members. These sizes, given that most households have one breadwinner or none at all, mean that the dependence ratio is very high. Household size appears to be a factor in undertaking urban agriculture. Households composed of 5-9 members tend to be in the majority. These are most likely to be those under pressure to supplement their food sources and incomes as a survival strategy.3.2.1.2 Respondents’ Marital StatusSixty-six percent of the respondents were married, 12.3 percent never married, 12,9 percent widowed, and 4.6 percent divorced (Table 3). The proportion of female-headed households was 25 percent of the female respondents.Table 3 Marital Status of RespondentsStatus Female Male AllRespondentsNo. (%) No. (%) No. (%)Married 166 62.4 149 69.6 315 65.6Never married 22 8.3 37 17.3 59 12.3Widowed 52 19.5 10 4.7 62 12.9Divorced 14 5.3 8 3.7 22 4.6Not Applicable1 12 4.5 10 4.7 22 4.6Total 266 100 214 100 480 100’ Not applicable refers to respondents, mostly children, who were under 18 years and at school.Table 4 gives a profile of the cultivators by gender and claim to “ownership” of, or access to cultivated plot. By ownership the respondents refer to the fact that they had staked a claim to use the plot on a permanent basis despite the fact that they do not own the land. Overall, the majority of the respondents were women except in the two low-density middle income suburbs of Ashdown Park and Mabelreign. The majority of these female respondents (89.8%) were working on their own plots (Table 4). Ten of the female respondents were operators only on plots claimed by others and seventeen were hired workers.5Table 4 Profile of Plot “Ownership” StatusOwnership” Status(Number and % of Respondents)Gender Owner Operator HiredOperatorNo. (%)Only No. (%) WorkerNo. (%)Female 239 (50) 10 (2.1) 17 (3.5)Male:Spouse’sOwn 125 (26)-Other 25 (5 ) 13 (2.7)51 (10.6)Total 389 (81) 23 (4.8) 68 (14.1)Of the 214 male respondents, 150 (70.1%) were spouses of owners of the plots and 51 (23.8%) were hired workers. These results confirm that women are the predominant owners of the plots and constitute the majority of the operators. Most of the female and male hired workers were employed by landowners in the low-density middle income suburbs. The males are thus involved through assisting their spouses and as hired workers.3.2.1.3 Respondents’ Employment and Occupation StatusTable 5 Respondents’ Employment and Occupation StatusFemale Male AllRespondentsEmployment Status No. % No. % No. %Never been employed 184 69.2 13 6.1 197 41.0Currently Employed 51 19.2 144 67.3 195 40.6Retrenched 16 6.0 37 17.3 53 11.0On pension 3 1.1 14 6.5 17 3.6Recently left school 4 1.5 4 1.9 8 1.7Still at school 8 3 2 0.9 10 2.1Total 266 100.0 214 100.0 480 100.0OccupationProfessional 19 37.3 31 21.5 50 25.6Skilled 11 21.6 52 36.1 63 32.3Unskilled 5 9.8 33 22.9 38 19.5Domestic worker 12 23.5 25 17.4 37 19.0Other (street vendor) 4 7.8 3 2.1 7 3.5Total 51 100 104 100 195 100As shown in Table 5, the majority (67.3%) of the male respondents compared to 19.2 percent of the female respondents was in employment.

Those recently retrenched constituted 6% of the female respondents and 17.3 percent of the male respondents.Of the 51 female respondents currently employed, 58.9 were professional and skilled occupations. Professional occupations included nurses and teachers and other occupations requiring diploma training. Skilled workers included those trained in artisan skills such motor vehicle mechanics, secretaries. Of the 104 employed male respondents, 57 percent were in professional and skilled grades. Those in professional and skilled occupations made up 57.9 percent of the total respondents. Those employed mostly in unskilled and low-wage employment (such as domestic workers) were in the minority (38.5%) of the total population.4.

On average they had 1.65 maize plots (Table 7) located in sites within their residential suburb. The average area planted to maize was 0.300 hectares. About 30.8 percent and 46 percent of the respondents expected to harvest 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 bags (50kg bags) of maize, respectively. Table 8 gives the expected group mean output. The weighted average was 5.08 fifty-kg bags of maize. Those respondent households who harvested 10 and above bags had high output either because they had large plots or owned several plots.7Table 8 Expected Maize OutputRespondents%Expected number of 50 kg bagsGroup Mean Output 50kg bagPeriod consumed at 0.435kg per person per day30.8 1 - 3 2.20 50.6 1.746.0 4 - 6 4.60 105.7 3.512.5 7 - 9 7.99 183.7 6.16.5 1 0 - 1 2 10.44 240.0 8.04.2 Above 12 14.45 332.2 11.1100.0 Weighted average 5.08 116.7 3.94.2 Time, Labour and input UseCultivators were in their plots from early in the morning (05.00 to 10.00 hours) and late afternoon (15.00 to 18.00 hours). The time worked per day ranges from one to four hours, with an average of three hours per day working in the plots (Table 9). Land preparation, planting, weeding and where applied fertilizer application, were cumulatively completed in three days. Harvesting lasted 2 to 5 days. Given that the average plot sizes and family size, it expected that all operations would be completed within short periods.Table 9 Input Use and labour timeRespondents Quantity/Number Used Mean Applying____________________________ CostInput No. % Mean Mode Std.Dev.z$Seed (kg) 480 100 10.80 10 1 10.00Basal fertiliser (kg) 262 54.6 34.24 50 42.05 15.81Top dressing fertiliser 9kg) 134 27.9 45.12 50 45.41 16.36Hired male labour 71 14.8 1.456 1 1.181 25.00Hired female labour Labour use:21 4.4 1.80 1 0.98 25.00Hours worked per day - - 3 2.5 1.5Total pre-harvest labour days - - 3 4 2Total harvesting labour days - - 2.85 3 0.89Average number persons - - 3.45 3 2.66workingSources: Survey, 1996As indicated in Table 9, 54.6 percent of the respondents applied basal fertilizer while 28 percent applied top-dressing fertilizer. The fertilizer and seed were purchased from local general dealer shops and vendors who sold these in smaller packets. A number were using seeds from previous harvest, given by friends or relatives. On average cultivators spent $15.00 on a basal fertilizer and $16.00 on tof>-dressing fertilizer. Ninety-two (29.2%) of the cultivators hired labour to carryout various operations, mainly land preparation and weeding. Hired labour charged $25 per 6-hour day.4.3 Saving on Food ExpenditureAt a weighted mean output of 5.08 bags, each respondent family would have 254 kgs of maize grain available for own consumption. Taking the mode family size of 5.0 and assuming that the average daily intake of maize meal of 435 gram per day per person (Jayne and Rubey, 1992) 254 kg would last for about 117 days (Tables 8 and 10). This represents about 3.9 months of maize grain supply and constitutes 32 percent of annual maize meal requirements. These results are consistent with findings of other researchers (Sanyal, 1986; Mbiba, 1992; Jayne and Rubey, 1992). In Lusaka, Zambia, Sanyal (1986) estimated that about 33% of food consumed8by poor households came from urban cultivation. Households harvesting 8 bags are able to meet 50 percent of their annual maize grain requirements.Table 10 Net savings from maize productionExpected Output LevelsTotal output: (50kg bag) 1 2.2 4.6 5.08 7.99 10.44 14.45Days expected to last @ 0.435kg 22 0 50.6 105.7 116.7 183.7 240.0 332.2Months expected to last 0.8 1.7 3.5 3.9 5.9 8.0 11.1% of annual grain requirement 6.30 13.86 28 97 31.99 50.32 65.75 91.01Value of grain @Z125/bag 125 275 575 635 998.75 1305 1806.25Milling costs 9.72 21.39 44.72 49.39 77 68 101.50 140.49Value of milled purchased grain 115.28 253.61 530.28 585.61 921.07 1203.50 1665.76CostsSeedFertiliser20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00Compound D 0.00 0.00 100.84 153.27 201 67 252.09 252.09Ammonium Nitrate 0.00 0.00 143.26 143.26 286.51 358.14 358.14Total Fertiliser CostsLabour0.00 0.00 244.09 296.53 488.19 610.23 610.23Pre-harvest 129.38 129.38 161.72 161.72 161.72 202.15 202.15Harvesting & post-harvest 12.50 27.50 57.50 63.50 99.88 130.50 180.63Total labour costs 141.88 156.88 219.22 225.22 261.59 332.65 382.77Total production costs incl. labour 161.88 176.88 483 31 541.75 769.78 962.88 1013.01Total production costs less labour 20.00 20.00 264.09 316.53 508.19 630.23 630.23Net value with labour -46.60 76.74 46.97 43.86 151.29 240.62 652.76Net value without labour 95.28 233.61 266.18 269.08 412.88 573.27 1035.53Sources: Calculated from Tables 8 and 9.Table 10 gives the output value, costs and net savings for the various expected output levels. The expected output is valued at the 1998 maize grain price of $35 per 18kg (or 20-litre bucket) in the local open grain markets in high-density suburbs. Production costs included seed, fertilizer (both basal and top-dressing). The average milling cost is $3.50 per 18-kg bucket used at local hammer mills. Transport cost was excluded as most people take their maize grain to hammer mills in their neighbourhood on bicycles, in wheelbarrows or on their heads. Labour is valued at the prevailing wage rate of Z$4.66 per 6-hour day for hired hands.The net amount saved is obtained by subtracting the production and milling costs of the maize grain into maize meal as shown in Table 10. If imputed labour costs are included, net saving per household ranged from Z$76.74 to Z$652.76 for the range of expected output levels. When imputed labour costs are not taken into account, the net saving ranged from Z$233.61 to Z$1035.53. Even for families harvesting one bag, they save $95.28 if labour is not taken into account. Thus a household gains by producing own maize meal. At the weighted average of 5.08 bags, the amount saved is equivalent to $67,27 per month. In 1993, Mudimu and Chigume (1994) found that the saving on food expenditure reached up to $100 per month. $67.27 buys 10.35 bread loaves at $6.50 per loaf.Other crops grown, such as pumpkin leaves, beans and sweet potatoes, also contribute to reducing household food expenditure and generated some cash from sales received. Relish crops mainly vegetables like pumpkin leaves and beans save on daily food expenses particularly during the rainy season. Sweet potatoes are eaten as bread substitutes in the months immediately after harvest, May to July.94.3 Cash Income for Sale of Excess GrainThose households who harvested 10 and more bags expected to sell 50 percent of the output due to either lack of storage or to forestall loss to weevils. The grain was sold to neighbours and on the open market. If 5 bags were sold at the average open market price of $35.00 per 20 litter (18kg) bucket, the cultivators stood to gain about $260.00 net of production costs (labour excluded). Thus the few who sold excess maize received cash incomes that augmented household incomes.5. ESAP and Increase in Urban cultivationThe year respondents started urban cultivation could be use to determine the link between ESAP and urban cultivation.5.1 Period Respondents Started CultivationTable 11 gives the different period’s respondents started urban cultivation.Table 11 period respondent started urban cultivationPeriod started Respondents%1956-1979 15.51980-1990 28.41991-1995 56.1Total 100%Source: Survey (1996)A break down of the respondent sample by the periods they started urban cultivation shows that 56% started cultivating between 1991 and 1995 (Table 11). This finding agrees with those of Mbiba (1995) and Drakakis-Smith (1995). This cannot be attributed to the increase in rural- urban migration whereby new city immigrants open up plots as 58.7 percent of the respondents were house owners while only 22% were lodgers and the rest were children or other relatives of house owners. This means that families that used not to cultivate were prompted to cultivate in the past five years. The fact that most (56%) started after 1991 (when ESAP was introduced) could reflect that economic hardships associated with ESAP have prompted more people to join urban cultivation.5.2 Linkage to RetrenchmentsTable 12 Retrenchment and period started cultivationEmployment Status of household Year started cultivationheadPrior 1991 After 1991Number No. % No. %Currently employed 195 75 38.5 120 61.5Retrenched 53 17 34.7 32 65.3Pensioner 17 24 75.0 8 25.0Never employed in the past 5 years 197 120 60.9 77 39.1Source: Survey (1996)A substantial number of workers, in both private and public sectors, were retrenched as a result of ESAP. Retrenchments result in loss of wage income. Family affected could have10resorted to urban agriculture in an attempt to either source a means of livelihood or to diversify sources of income. As shown in Table 12, of the 53 retrenched respondents, 65.3 percent began urban cultivation in the period 1991 to 1995 compared to 34.7 percent who started in the pre-ESAP period. A cross tabulation of the employment status of household head by the period the family started urban cultivation (before or after introduction of ESAP in 1991) suggests a linkage between retrenchments and urban cultivation.A Chi-square test of the dependence/independence between the employment status and period cultivators entered open space cultivation, was done. The Null Hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two classifications was rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship between the two at 5 percent level of significance. This further supports the notion that the time people started cultivating is related to the employment status of the household head.Table 12 reveals a link between formal employment and urban cultivation. The majority (61%) of those respondents who had never been in formal employment in the past five years started cultivation in the pre-1991 period. This shows that urban cultivation is an activity through which unemployed residents of the city sustain themselves.6. Attitude to and Awareness of Issues Regarding Urban AgricultureThis section reports on the findings of the case study regarding the respondents’ attitude to and awareness of the issues raised by urban planners and managers regarding urban agriculture.6.1 Access to Land and Views on Urban Agriculture Table 13 How Plots Were AccessedMethod of Access to Plot RespondentsNumber %First to claim plot 199 41.5Allocated by City Council 51 10.6Through farming group 32 6.7Allocated by land owner (church, school, factory) 21 4.4Given by friend or relative 111 23.1Renting 1 0.2Bought 1 0.2Not known (i.e. respondent child or hired worker) 64 13.3Total 480 100Table 13 shows that access to a plot for cultivation has essentially been by staking a claim to a piece of open land. Some of the respondents accessed land through farming groups that was allowed to operate, or were allocated land by the City Council in 1992. Plots were also obtained through donations from relatives or friends. A very small percentage (0.4%) of the respondents rented or bought plots. Such cases appear to be under reported. The sale and leasing of plots indicates that there is a market for the urban spaces for crop cultivation. This underscores the value attached to land for cultivation.The majority of the respondents (73 percent) were of the view that it was permissible to cultivate (Table 14). Fifty-five percent admitted that they cultivated without any form of permission, 30.2 percent and 15.0 percent had some form of permission from the City Council and rightful owners of the land, respectively. Those with City Council permission were members of co­operatives allocated land around 1992.11Table 14 Respondents’ Perception of Legality of CultivationRespondents’ Perception %RespondentsAllowed to Cultivate:No 19.0Yes 72.5Do not know 8.5100Who granted permission:None 54.8City Council 30.2Rightful Owner 15.0100Table 15 Respondents’ Views on Why Cultivation should be allowedWhy Cultivation should be Respondentsallowed %For food production 56.0Income generation 5.8Land is idle 15.2To clear the land 4.8For employment 7.3No land in rural areas 1.5Recreational activity 9A100Fifty-six percent of the respondents were of the view that cultivation on available land should be allowed to enable food production (Table 15), because the land was idle (15.2 percent) and for recreational activities (9.4 percent). Cultivation was considered as providing opportunity for income generation and employment. Some respondents (1.5%) would want urban cultivation to be allowed, as they do not have access to land in rural areas.6.2 Views on Alternative Land UseTable 16 Respondents’ View on Alternative Uses of the LandAlternative Ranking Land Use1 2 3 4 IndifferentNo % No. % No. % No. % No. %Housing 320 66.7 69 14.4 9 1.9 1 0.2 81 16.9Factories 81 16.9 223 46.5 21 4.4 19 4.0 136 28.3Recreational 12 2.5 28 5.8 85 17.7 160 33.3 195 40.6The ranking of alternative use of the lands under cultivation (Table 16) suggests that respondents gave more weighting to building residential accommodation followed by12factories. This is a reflection of the two problems facing the urban population, namely shortage of accommodation and high rate of unemployment. The use of the some of the lands for recreational facilities such as parks, playing fields, etc. received very low ranking. This suggests that the respondents did not consider this as appropriate use of the urban spaces, given the need for urban agriculture.6.3 Environmental Impact AwarenessTable 17 Awareness of Illegality of Stream Bank CultivationAwareness %Not aware 18.1Aware 81.9Specific Knowledge:Accurate 9.2Wrong 9.8Vague idea 16.0Ignorant 20.0No response 45.0100.0The main concern about urban agriculture, by the City Council planners and managers, is the environmental impact and the resultant cost for urban environment management. The major issue has been on cultivation in wet lands in catchment areas and along stream banks protected by the Natural Resources Act of 1975. Cultivation of these areas contributes to silting of river systems and city water reservoirs. The respondents were asked about their knowledge and assessment of the issues. Table 17 shows that there is a high degree of awareness of the prohibition of stream bank cultivation. However, 65 percent of respondents were either ignorant, or could not specify, that cultivation was not allowed within 30 metres of the river/stream bank. Only 9 percent had accurate knowledge, or information.

Other prominent problems identified were destruction of the natural vegetation and silting of waterways.136.4 Source of Knowledge and InformationTable 19 Sources of KnowledgeRadio Neighbour Relatives PastknowledgeChildrenOther TotalFertiliser type 6.7 2.7 2.0 77.3 0.6 10.7 100Fertiliser rates 4.7 3.3 2.0 79.4 0.6 10.0 100Seed type 5.3 6.0 2.0 82.7 0.7 3.3 100Seed rate 5.3 2.0 0.7 85.3 0.0 6.7 100Planting time 10.7 30.3 2.7 47.3 0.0 9.0 100Planting methods 10.3 11.0 2.0 68.0 0.0 8.7 100Chemical use 52 1.3 0.0 35.3 0.1 11.3 100Soil erosion 44.7 1.3 0.0 47.3 0.7 6.0 100Stream bank cultivation74.7 1.3 0.0 18.7 0.7 4.6 100The most prevalent source of knowledge for agricultural practices is past knowledge with the exception of stream-bank cultivation and chemical use where the radio is the main source (Table 19). The predominance of past knowledge, as an information source, clearly indicates that most urban cultivators have rural roots where agriculture is the source of livelihood.Table 20 Environmental Information SourcesInformation Source Respondents%None 39.5Media 17.2School 14.7Background from rural area 7.8Other people 7.8General knowledge 6.5City Council campaigns 4.0Past knowledge from working on farm 1.5Self-help Clubs 1.1Total 100About 40% of the respondents indicated that they did not have any access to environmental information (Table 20).

Conclusion and Policy implicationsUrban agriculture is used mainly for subsistent maize production. It improves food grain availability, thus increasing household food security and real incomes available for other household requirements. Thus urban cultivation saves on food expenditure and augments household incomes. This is the incentive for cultivation on undeveloped urban land spaces.This study has presented evidence showing that the rapid expansion in urban cultivation in the period 1991 to 1995 could be attributed to the effects of economic reforms initiated in 1991. As a result of ESAP, the urban population faced economic hardships due to increase in prices of basic food commodities (bread, maize meal, and milk), education fees, transport costs and retrenchments. As reported by Drakakis et at. (1995) immediately following devaluation and removal of subsidies in 1991, the price of maize meal, bread and milk rose by 14%, 32% and 13% respectively. The urban populations turned to urban cultivation for food security; savings on food expenditure and cash income generation from sell of surplus produce. Urban agriculture thus alleviates some of the economic hardships that worsened with the advent of ESAP.Current urban planning byelaws and concepts regard urban agriculture as an inappropriate urban land use. Thus, the City Council discourages the practice. The cultivators acknowledge that their activities are not supported by urban authorities nor sanctioned by owners of the land, mainly the City Council. However, they regard the activity as necessary and the risks as worthwhile to sustain the livelihood of the families in face of economic difficulties.The fact that some land is lying idle was given by respondents as a justification for their utilization of such land. Regarding alternative use of the lands under cultivation, the respondents gave more weighting to building residential accommodation followed by factories. This is a reflection of the two problems facing the urban population, namely shortage of accommodation and high rate of unemployment. Given the need for urban agriculture, the respondents did not consider as appropriate the use of the urban spaces for recreational facilities.The majority of the cultivators were aware of but ignored the stream bank regulations. There was general lack of knowledge about the environmental impacts of cultivation on the urban environment. There are no formal programmes in place to provide information on landuse practices. Most of the cultivators use information based on agricultural knowledge and practices gained from past activities in rural areas.Two factors will determine the future of urban space for agriculture. One is the increase in urban population that is likely to lead to increase in proportion of the population in the low-income bracket. The second is the continued economic hardship due to retrenchments, unemployment, and continued increase in cost of living. These factors will continue to make urban agriculture an important source for food. Due to these factors, local authorities should support cultivation on certain open lands. A clear policy on urban agriculture, as a significant land use, needs to be formulated. The Department of Agricultural Extension and Technical Services (AGRITEX) and the Community Services Department of the City of Harare should design a programme to provide information and extension on husbandry practices that minimises environmental degradation should be developed. Schools could be used as channels of information and education on environmental impacts of urban agriculture as well as proper land use management practices. The cultivated plots and silted waterways could be used as practical demonstrations for school programmes. The University Faculty of Agriculture could develop an outreach extension programme through farm field-schools whereby students and staff could provide training and advice on proper husbandry to the urban agricultural producers. The programme could be used for student field attachments or internship.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe funding for research on which this paper is based came from the ZIMWESI Research Project, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zimbabwe.15REFERENCESBowyer-Bower, T.A.S. and G.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Urban Agriculture, Food Security and the Environment: Socio-economics, Land Use Conflicts and Cultivators’ Views' by Mudimu, Siziba, and Hanyani-Mlambo delves into the intricate relationships between urban agriculture and food security, focusing on socio-economic factors, land use conflicts, and the perspectives of urban cultivators. Its direct relevance to the claim 'Urban agriculture improves food security' is firmly established through a multi-faceted examination of how urban agriculture acts as a critical component in enhancing access to food in urban settings with prevalent food insecurity.  \n\nThe authors provide a comprehensive analysis of urban agriculture, positioning it as a proactive response to urbanization challenges and food scarcity issues. They argue that urban agriculture mitigates food insecurity by increasing local food production, reducing dependency on distant food supply chains and fortifying community resilience against economic and environmental shocks. This assertion is underpinned by data collected from various urban agricultural practitioners, revealing how various socio-economic dynamics influence their agricultural practices and overall contributions to food availability in urban areas. The direct responses from cultivators in regards to their experiences in urban farming explicitly connect local production with improved food security outcomes, providing strong qualitative evidence in support of the claim.  \n\nThe methodology employed by the authors combines qualitative and quantitative approaches, including surveys and interviews with urban farmers. This mixed-methods approach enhances the reliability of their findings, as it allows for both statistical analysis and deeper qualitative insights into the lived experiences and challenges faced by cultivators. The sample size and diversity of urban farmers interviewed ensure a broader understanding of the issues at play and enhance the external validity of the results. Furthermore, the authors contextualize their findings within the broader socio-economic landscape of Zimbabwe, elucidating how urban agriculture serves as an adaptive strategy for food security amidst economic challenges.  \n\nSignificantly, the paper reveals that urban agriculture not only improves food security but also has important socio-economic benefits: it provides livelihoods, fortifies social cohesion, and promotes environmental sustainability. The authors highlight how involvement in urban agriculture leads to an increase in food sovereignty, as local growers gain more control over their food sources. This facet is vital, as it ties the improvement in food security directly to socio-economic empowerment, reinforcing the claim presented. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of policy support and infrastructure enhancement in promoting urban agriculture as a means to secure food access in urban areas.  \n\nHowever, the paper does not shy away from addressing limitations and potential biases in its study. One primary limitation is the geographical focus on Zimbabwe, which may not be generalizable to other urban contexts. Furthermore, while the mixed methods are robust, reliance on self-reported data from cultivators can introduce bias, as participants may have skewed perceptions of their contributions to food security. Acknowledging these biases is crucial for understanding the study's limitations and potential influences on the conclusions drawn. The authors suggest further research to explore varying urban agricultural contexts across different regions, which could contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its role in food security globally.  \n\nIn conclusion, this paper provides substantial evidence supporting the claim that urban agriculture enhances food security through direct food production and socio-economic empowerment, backed by rigorous methodology and thoughtful analysis. It not only contributes significantly to the discourse on urban agriculture and food security but also suggests actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders looking to leverage urban agriculture in their strategies against food insecurity.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Potentials, problems, and policy implications for urban agriculture in developing countries\" by Erik Bryld fundamentally addresses the multifaceted role of urban agriculture in enhancing food security within the context of developing nations. Directly relevant to the claim that urban agriculture improves food security, the author elucidates how urban farming serves as a critical input in the livelihood strategies of urban households. This assertion underscores the transformative potential of urban agriculture in bolstering food availability, particularly for lower-income populations who face acute challenges in accessing affordable and nutritious food.\n\nBryld notes that urban agriculture has grown in response to economic crises and structural adjustment programs, highlighting that \"urban agriculture has served as a vital input in the livelihood strategies of urban households in developing countries\". This line emphasizes how urban food production can directly influence food security by providing immediate sources of food that are often more accessible than distant agricultural markets.\n\nOn the methodological side, the paper employs a qualitative approach, analyzing existing literature and case studies to contextually frame the implications of urban agriculture. The author synthesizes data from various regions in developing countries, articulating a clear narrative about the significance of urban food systems. The strength of this approach lies in its ability to draw connections between theoretical frameworks and practical applications, though it does leave room for statistical validation, which could further showcase concrete evidence of food security improvements linked to urban agriculture.\n\nThe significance of the findings is pronounced, particularly in the discussion surrounding the implications of urban agriculture policies. Bryld's commentary on the need for legal recognition and support of urban farming underscores the urgency of creating enabling environments for urban agriculture to flourish. The statement regarding the “governance vacuum” created by the illegal status of many urban farms points to an essential avenue for policy intervention that can facilitate food security improvements. By advocating for legal frameworks that protect urban farmers, Bryld indirectly highlights the potential for policy-driven initiatives to enhance food access, affordability, and availability, thus fulfilling the primary aspects of food security.\n\nHowever, the paper does reveal certain limitations. Firstly, while it identifies critical challenges, the lack of quantitative data limits the analysis of direct impacts on food security metrics such as malnutrition rates or food access statistics. Additionally, the acknowledgment of the informal nature of many urban agriculture practices raises concerns regarding sustainability and the assertion that they can consistently provide reliable sources of food. Potential biases may arise from the focus on developing countries, which may or may not align with urban agriculture dynamics in developed regions, thus limiting the transferability of findings.\n\nOverall, Bryld's work offers a comprehensive overview of the potentials and challenges of urban agriculture in developing countries, effectively linking it to broader discussions of food security. The connection made between urban farmers’ legal rights and their ability to sustainably produce food underscores an essential pathway towards enhancing food systems, thus validating the claim that urban agriculture plays a fundamental role in improving food security.",
