This study investigates urban nature, encompassing forests, wetlands, and recreational areas, uncovering their positive effects on urban well-being and resilience, substantiated by scientific research. Notably, urban green spaces such as parks are pivotal in reducing stress, enhancing cognitive, and fostering social cohesion. Ensuring equal access to these spaces is crucial for resident well-being. Urban forests, often underrated, regulate temperature, mitigate noise, and enhance emotional well-being, contributing to climate adaptation and comfort. Wetlands are vital connectors between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, impacting water supply, stormwater management, and pollution reduction while acting as reservoirs and natural cleaners. Recreational areas offer opportunities for relaxation and interaction, necessitating customized planning. This research underscores urban nature's significance in shaping livable, sustainable, and resilient cities. Scientific studies stress their contributions to human well-being and the environment, advocating integration, and preservation. A synthesis of science, urban planning, and community engagement establishes the groundwork for nurturing these resources and harmonizing urban living with nature.

The design and management of natural resources to enhance human health and well-being may be traced back thousands of years to the earliest urban civilizations. From the irrigation projects of the Indus Valley and the aqueducts of the Roman Empire to integrated systems of landscaped urban parks and street trees in contemporary times, humans have sought to harness the capacity of nature to advance city life. This article presents a systems science framework that delineates critical relationships between grey and green elements of cities and human health and well-being by modeling the complex, dynamic problem of asthma in socioeconomically disadvantaged city neighborhoods. By understanding the underlying structure of urban spaces and the importance of social interactions, urban planners, public health officials, and community members may capitalize on opportunities to leverage resources to improve the health and well-being of urban populations and promote social justice and health equity\nFull Text: Cities and the Environment (CATE)\nVolume 5 | Issue 1 Article 3\n8-21-2012\nIntegrating Grey and Green Infrastructure to\nImprove the Health and Well-being of Urban\nPopulations\nErika Svendsen\nUSDA Forest Service, esvendsen@fs.fed.us\nMary E.

We investigated the impact of gardening activities on five soil functions and the relationship between plant (600 spp.) and soil fauna (earthworms: 18 spp., springtails: 39 spp.) in 85 urban gardens (170 sites) across the city of Zurich (Switzerland). Our results suggest that high plant diversity in gardens had a positive effect on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality, and that garden management intensity decreased plant diversity. Indices of biological activity in soil, such as organic and microbial carbon and bacterial abundance, showed a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Soil moisture and disturbance, driven by watering and tilling, were the driving forces structuring plant and soil fauna communities. Plant indicator values proved useful to assess soil fauna community structure, even in anthropogenic plant assemblages. We conclude that to enhance soil functions, gardeners should increase plant diversity, and lower management intensity. Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature\u2019s contribution to people\nFull Text: 1Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportsDirect and indirect effects of urban gardening on aboveground and belowground diversity influencing soil multifunctionalitySimon Tresch  1,2,3, David Frey2,4, Ren\u00e9e-Claire Le Bayon3, Paul M\u00e4der  1, Bernhard Stehle1,5, Andreas Fliessbach  1 & Marco Moretti2Urban gardens are popular green spaces that have the potential to provide essential ecosystem services, support human well-being, and at the same time foster biodiversity in cities.

In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development\nFull Text: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) 202-214     \u00a9 Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher\u2019s Office  IJSCET  http://penerbit.uthm.edu.my/ojs/index.php/ijscet ISSN : 2180-3242     e-ISSN : 2600-7959 International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology     *Corresponding author: sumarni.upm@gmail.com 2021 UTHM Publisher.

As urban populations continue to grow, the deficiency of parks and recreational areas adversely affects public health, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. The program aims to convert underutilized rooftops into vibrant green spaces, providing urban dwellers with new venues for relaxation, physical activity, and social interaction. The primary objective is to enhance physical and mental health outcomes for urban residents by increasing their access to green spaces through the creation of rooftop parks and gardens.\n\n\nThe program's methodology includes conducting a comprehensive needs assessment, constructing and establishing rooftop parks, engaging the community through awareness campaigns, and offering educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The success of the program will be measured using a robust evaluation framework with specific outcome and output indicators. Key outcome indicators include a 20% reduction in self-reported stress levels among residents living near the rooftop parks and a measurable decrease in urban heat island temperatures. Output indicators focus on the number of rooftop parks established, the level of community engagement, and participation rates in educational activities.\n\n\nTo ensure effective implementation, the program has developed a detailed plan encompassing architectural designs, community engagement strategies, and sustainable maintenance practices. Risk mitigation measures include seeking diverse funding sources, ensuring regulatory compliance, and employing flexible construction timelines to address potential delays. Community involvement is a cornerstone of the program, with organized events and workshops designed to foster a sense of ownership and ongoing support for the rooftop parks.\n\n\nThe Rooftop Parks and Gardens program offers a holistic solution to improving urban health and well-being. By transforming rooftops into green spaces, the program seeks to create more resilient, sustainable, and inclusive urban environments, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for all residents.Master of Public Healt\nFull Text:  FOR INTERNAL USE BY THE GILLINGS SCHOOL OF GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH ONLY.
