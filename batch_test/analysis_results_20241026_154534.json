It maps a conversation \namong the authors that is intended to introduce core system dynamics concepts. The causal map \nis presented for illustrative purposes only. It will be refined over the course of the next several \nyears through a project recently funded by the USDA Forest Service titled, “Integrating the Grey \nand the Green to Improve Health and Well-Being for Urban Populations” (Research Joint \nVenture Agreement, #12-JV-11242309-095). \n \n \nThroughout the history of cities, a wide range of social actors has competed over urban land as a \nscarce resource (Svendsen 2009). Regrettably, grey infrastructure (e.g., streets and sewers) has \ntoo often been positioned as being at odds with green infrastructure (e.g., parks and open spaces), \ninstead of the two being conceived of as mutually beneficial (Svendsen 2011). While there is \nincreasing recognition that cities are ecosystems with interacting human, structural, and \necological components (McDonnell and Pickett 1993; Machlis et al. 1997; Vibrant Cities & \nUrban Forests Task Force 2011), to date it has been difficult to communicate regarding how the \ninvolved elements relate to one another, much less decide how best to intervene to obtain desired \noutcomes. The purpose of this paper is to use system dynamics to visualize and explore the \ncomplex and dynamic relationships between grey and green infrastructure, and the benefits of \ntheir integration on the health and well-being of urban populations. \n \nAs a vital component of green infrastructure in cities, community gardens are exceptional \nin their ability to address an array of public health and livability issues across the lifespan (Twiss \net al. 2003). While they began more than a hundred years ago at the turn of the twentieth century \n(Lawson 2005), they are especially important during times of war, economic crisis, and food \nshortages (Helphand 2006). For example, during the Great Depression, city lands were made \navailable to the unemployed and impoverished by the Work Projects Administration (WPA), \nwith nearly 5000 gardens on 700 acres cultivated in New York City alone (Hynes 1996 as cited \nin Armstrong 2000). Today, community gardens are viewed as beneficial to participants by \nproviding them with opportunities to be actively involved in decision-making about the \ndevelopment and use of urban space (Stone 2009). \n \nSYSTEMS SCIENCE \n \nA systems science approach may inform healthy cities and sustainable urban agriculture \ninitiatives by providing mechanisms for modeling complex, dynamic problems (Northridge and \nFreeman 2011; Metcalf and Widener 2011). In particular, system dynamics is concerned with the \nidentification and modeling of feedback relationships that characterize a particular problem, \nincluding inherent delays (Forrester 1961; Sterman 2000). By linking the structure of complex \nsystems to their behavior over time, system dynamics modeling helps interested parties and \ndecision makers assess the impact of different interventions in both the short-term and the long-\nterm (Metcalf et al. 2011). \n \nMoreover, because it is a methodology that is conducive to interdisciplinary work and an \ninherently iterative process, the construction of a system dynamics model provides an \nopportunity for input from a variety of stakeholders, which may be especially important in \n1\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nunderstanding the relationships between community gardens and human health and well-being. \nAfter jointly articulating the problem, a causal map is drawn to visualize feedback relationships \namong the relevant factors that shape system behavior over time (Metcalf et al. 2011). Such a \nrepresentation constitutes a dynamic hypothesis of plausible relationships that may be tested with \na formal computer model, often after undergoing significant revision through either a \nparticipatory or group modeling process (Metcalf et al. 2010; van den Belt, 2004). For \ncommunity groups and practitioners who lack the resources needed to quantify and calibrate a \nsimulation model, or who aim primarily to reflect group knowledge using visual iconography, \nthe construction of a causal map may be a worthwhile goal in and of itself (Ford 2009). The \nderived causal map then becomes a boundary object that facilitates team communication about \nproject scope and underlying assumptions (Star and Griesemer 1989), and may be utilized in \ncommunity visioning and strategic planning processes (Twiss et al. 2003).  \n \nAn orientation to the causal mapping process is called systems thinking (Senge 1990; \nMeadows 2008) or feedback thought (Richardson 1991), a necessary skill in system dynamics \nmodeling. In order to introduce key concepts, a systems perspective is employed in this article to \nframe the problem of community concern around the high prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nunderserved urban neighborhoods. \n \nCAUSAL DYNAMICS \n \nThe etiology of asthma is complex and multi-factorial, including both genetic and environmental \ninfluences (Brisbon et al. 2005). It is currently the most common chronic disease of childhood in \nthe United States and the primary reason for school absenteeism, and disproportionately burdens \nmany socioeconomically disadvantaged urban communities (Gold and Wright 2005). \nExplanations for this health inequity include poverty, variations in environmental exposures, and \ndifferential access to medical care; reducing the burden of asthma requires efforts to address the \nunderlying social justice conditions that produce this health inequity (Greenwood et al. 2011). \n \n The hypothesized causal dynamics involved in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods are mapped in Figure 1, with a focus on \ncommunity concern for asthma as a motivating factor for both grey and green infrastructure \ninterventions. \n \n2\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\n \nFigure 1. Causal dynamics of asthma \narrows indicate positive polarity. Dotted arrows indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. \nHatched arrows indicate a delay, or time lag, to allow for resulting shifts in behavior and activity.\n \nThe causal map in Figure 1 makes explicit features of conversations among the authors \nregarding the complex and dynamic relationships involved in the case of asthma. This causal \nmap was constructed by co-author Sara S. Metcalf and revised with feedback from the other \nauthors. Note that the causal map uses solid arrows to indicate positive polarity, and dotted \narrows to indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. Positive\nincrease in the cause results in an increase in the effect, whereas negative polarity indicates that \nan increase in the cause results in a decrease in the effect. These links combine to create a set of \nreinforcing and counteracting feedback loops, as discussed in the sections that follow. While \nmany of the transitions outlined in Figure 1 involve implicit delays, the hatched arrows from \n“community concern for asthma” to “mass transit improvement” and “local asthma clinics” \nsignify delays that are substantially longer than other delays in the system. Explicit recognition \nof these time lags is necessary to allow for resulting shifts in behaviors and activities. This causal \nmap is a representation of the authors' shared understanding\ngreen infrastructure on urban health issues such as asthma. As this modeling effort continues, \ncertain unintended consequences of proposed interventions may challenge these initial \nhypotheses and thus require further analys\n \nGREY INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS\n \nGrey infrastructure has been defined as conventional storage structures (reservoirs, detention \nponds) and conveyances (pipes, canals) used to manage drinking, sewer, or storm water, usually \nin socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods\n polarity signifies that an \n about the influence of grey and \nis. \n \n \n. Solid \n \n3\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nconstructed of concrete or metal (Foster et al. 2011). It also includes streets, roads, bridges, and \nbuildings that do not incorporate technologies intended to achieve environmental goals (Foster et \nal. 2011). At the bottom of Figure 1 are two balancing or counteracting loops. For the sake of \nillustration, assume that mass transit improvements and local asthma clinics are part of the grey \ninfrastructure of a community, even as it may be possible to incorporate natural vegetation and \ninnovative grey materials such as permeable pavements and white roofs into these interventions \n(Foster et al. 2011). \n \nIn the outermost counteracting loop at the bottom right of the causal map, community \nconcern for asthma leads to the construction of local asthma clinics, but this takes time, as \nindicated by the hatched arrow. Once the local asthma clinics are operating, however, the \nprevalence of asthma symptoms is decreased, as depicted by the dotted arrow. In the absence of \neducation and outreach on the importance of its mitigation, a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms could lead to less community concern for asthma, as depicted in the causal map. In \nother words, prevalence increases concern, and lower prevalence ultimately lowers concern. This \nwould tend toward cycles of increasing prevalence and concern, followed by mitigated \nprevalence, diminished concern, disinvestment, and a potential resurgence of asthma prevalence. \nA useful comparison would be a campaign against secondhand smoke, a trigger for asthma \nsymptoms: although the prevalence of smoking has declined, the campaign against secondhand \nsmoke remains quite strong. Without a secondhand smoke campaign, concern about smoking \nmight diminish, and smoking prevalence may again increase.  \n \nA second counteracting loop is triggered by community concern for asthma leading to \nmass transit improvement, although again it may take time for funds to be allocated and \nconstruction to be completed, as per the hatched arrow designation. To the extent that mass \ntransit is then more efficient to use than automobiles, traffic volume will decrease, as indicated \nby the dotted arrow. Lower traffic volume means improved air quality due to lower levels of \nrespiratory irritant pollutants such as ground level ozone and respirable particulate matter \n(Brisbon et al. 2005), as signified by a dotted (inverse) arrow in the causal map. In turn, \nimproved air quality leads to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms, once again denoted by a \ndotted arrow. Over time, the counteracting loop is completed when a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms eventually leads to less community concern for asthma, as before. In recognition of \nthis potential feedback mechanism, alternative interventions may be represented that would \nmitigate the diminishing of community concern for asthma as its prevalence declines. By \ndiagramming the underlying structure of these relationships, consequent behaviors and activities \nflowing from grey infrastructure investments may be explicitly articulated and constructively \ndebated. \n \nGREEN INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS \n \nGreen infrastructure encompasses the naturally occurring and human-built features that manage \nstorm water, remove pollutants, conserve energy, reduce erosion, and provide other ecological, \ncost-effective, and environmentally sustainable services (Vibrant Cities & Urban Forests Task \nForce 2011). Community concern for asthma may motivate individual volunteers, civic groups, \nand philanthropic donors to create green spaces centered on plants and waterways, leading to the \ncultivation of community gardens (Svendsen 2011). The bottom left of Figure 1 depicts a \n4\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nreinforcing feedback loop whereby community concern for asthma leads to the creation of green \nspaces, which in turn leads to the cultivation of community gardens, resulting in a stronger sense \nof community, which leads to renewed community concern for asthma. Note that green \ninfrastructure interventions may be deployed more rapidly than mass transit improvements or the \nconstruction of asthma clinics (i.e., there are no hatched arrows leading into or out of the \ncommunity gardens element in the causal map). \n \n In addition, the cultivation of community gardens leads to more opportunities for \ngardening, and eventually to more members of the community being involved in gardening \n(Figure 1). On the right-hand side of the causal map, there are two additional reinforcing \nfeedback loops. In the outermost loop, gardening leads to shared experience among community \nmembers and a stronger sense of community, which again results in renewed community concern \nfor asthma. In the adjacent interior loop, gardening leads to enhanced gardening skills, then in \nturn to more opportunities for gardening. According to Twiss et al. (2003), gardening workshops \nprovide opportunities for community members of all ages to develop skills in leadership, \ncommunity organizing, cultural competency, and program planning, implementation, and \nevaluation; gardening skills are enhanced through experiential learning, which includes \nintergenerational and peer-to-peer mentoring and train-the-trainer models. Ongoing, interactive \nlearning opportunities help to sustain momentum for gardening, which is effectively \ncommunicated via the reinforcing feedback loop in the causal map. \n \nHEALTH AND WELL-BEING DYNAMICS \n \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Health is a state of complete physical, \nmental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” (see \nhttps://apps.who.int/aboutwho/en/definition.html) While social well-being is included in the \nWHO definition of health, well-being includes multiple dimensions and is measured in a variety \nof ways in the scientific literature. For individuals, well-being may be understood as positive \naffect, life satisfaction, or simply happiness. For communities, well-being may be thought of as \nlivability, or shared experiences. \n \n A central reinforcing loop in Figure 1 is formed by the positive and reflexive relationship \nbetween health and well-being. For instance, enhanced well-being may lead to lower blood \npressure and less hypertension, resulting in fewer cardiovascular events (Shirai et al. 2009). On \nthe other hand, good health may foster engagement in social activities, including community \ngardening, thereby improving individual and community well-being (Armstrong 2000). For \nillustrative purposes, two pathways leading from community gardens are depicted in the causal \nmap, which are consonant with the research interests of the involved authors. The first pathway \nleads to well-being through sacredness, an interpretive act of ‘setting aside’ space for community \nor personal use that intertwines the sacred and the profane, and may include rituals, ceremony, \nand pilgrimage (Svendsen and Campbell 2010). The second pathway leads to improved nutrition \nand better health through the availability of fresh local produce (Metcalf and Widener 2011). \nNote also at the top of the causal map that gardening leads to increased physical activity, which \nin turn leads to better health, in concert with both the existing literature and the lived experiences \nof gardeners (Armstrong 2000; Wakefield et al. 2007).  \n \n5\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\n Systems dynamics modeling is also useful for understanding unanticipated effects. For \ninstance, while physical activity leads to enhanced health, it may also induce asthma symptoms \n(Parsons et al. 2011), as depicted in Figure 1. In general, though, better health leads to a lower \nprevalence of asthma symptoms, as denoted by the dotted arrow in the causal map. \n \nTeig et al. (2009) reported that the social organizational underpinnings of gardens give \nrise to a range of social processes, including social connectedness, reciprocity, mutual trust, \ncollective decision-making, civic engagement, and community building—all of which are part of \npathways leading to improved human health and well-being. Systems science modeling may be \nused to simulate social networks as well (Valente 2010), even as it will not be dealt with at \nlength in this article. \n \nWHOLE SYSTEMS \n \nAs exemplified by Figure 1, ongoing efforts to improve asthma in disadvantaged city \nneighborhoods may be meaningfully abetted by modeling that explicitly links grey and green \ninfrastructure. An integrative, complex systems perspective helps to identify interventions as \nleverage points that impact interconnected components and domains. Through the process of \narticulating causal relationships between elements, community members and social scientists \nengage in a participatory process of knowledge sharing to develop a joint sense of how resources \nought to be allocated to improve the health and well-being of urban populations and promote \nsocial justice and health equity. As illustrated in the causal map, two counteracting loops are \ninduced with grey infrastructure interventions (mass transit improvements and establishment of \nlocal asthma clinics), which also incur meaningful investment and inherent delays.  \n \nOn the other hand, the causal map is valuable in identifying a series of reinforcing loops \nthat is induced with green infrastructure interventions. In other words, planting a community \ngarden may not be the most direct response to addressing the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, even as it leads to the availability of fresh produce and improved \nnutrition and engenders a sense of community and sacredness, which are linked in turn to health \nand well-being. \n \nWhile virtuous cycles were emphasized earlier in this article related to the preservation of \ngreen spaces and the creation of community gardens, they might become vicious cycles if \nenvironmentally sustainable city planning is not enforced, economic policies fail to consider the \nshort-term and long-term benefits of urban forests, and incentives that curtailBris sprawl and \nencourage biodiversity are not enacted (Brown and Jameton 2000). The reinforcing nature of the \nfeedback loops indicates their capacity to destabilize the ecosystem. To counter this tendency, a \nsystems perspective underscores the value of coordinated interventions that integrate grey and \ngreen infrastructure, to guide decisions that provide urban populations with environmental, \neconomic, social, and health benefits, and build resilience in social-ecological systems (Olsson et \nal. 2004). \n \n \n \n \n6\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nLITERATURE CITED \n \nArmstrong, D.

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

Industrial development has accelerated China’s land use transformation, leading to a loss in urban green spaces (UGS) and their uneven distribution, thus exacerbating the health disparities between rural migrants and local dwellers. In 2016, the State Council issued the\nHealthy China 2030 Planning Guidelines\nto address health concerns and highlight the importance of optimizing the greenspace system for health promotion. Critically, the plan underscores the goals of ‘One Health’, aimed at improving health across all social groups. It focuses specifically on rural migrants, who are at risk for mental illness due to social exclusion induced by spatial and cultural displacement for large-scale migration [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Although previous research has thoroughly explored the health benefits of UGS in mainstream populations [\n4\n,\n5\n], few studies have been conducted on rural migrants. The ‘migrants status’ as a factor in Social Determinants of Health (SDH) indicates not only differences in social structure but also potential inequalities in access to favorable facilities [\n6\n]. This paper focuses on rural migrants in urban China, an environmentally vulnerable group [\n3\n], and examines their exposure to neighborhood greenspace in terms of both\nquality\nand\nquantity\n, as well as the mental health outcomes associated with this exposure, aiming to enrich the body of research on environmental justice within urban green spaces.\nUnpacking the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS: implications for migrant populations\nExposure to various attributes of greenspace has different implications for health outcomes. Scholars commonly examine their\nquality\nand\nquantity\ndimensions. The\nquality\nof UGS refers to elements that determine value and desirability, including aesthetic attractiveness, utility, and ecological diversity [\n7\n]. The\nquantity\nrefers to the amount or extent of greenery in a specific geographical location, covering indoor or outdoor greenery, wild nature, pocket parks, wetlands, and other features [\n8\n]. The conventional methodology for evaluating the\nquality\nof UGS involves questionnaires and field audits [\n4\n]. Such methods are, however, subject to some drawbacks, such as subjective responses and participants’ recall bias, as well as being time-consuming and resource-intensive, which makes them challenging to implement on a large scale. To quantify the UGS, researchers frequently use geospatial data, satellite imagery, and other related datasets. Yet, these methods are constrained to an overhead perspective when measuring greenery, to some extent ignoring the eye-level. As urban computational science develops, an increasing number of studies utilize street-view images to capture the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS. Consequently, integrating multisource data is becoming a prevalent approach in environmental research. This study aims to contribute to urban environmental research by incorporating traditional survey data, geospatial information, and urban management data to explore the health effects of UGS through a nuanced, multifaceted lens.\nMost previous research has concentrated on the UGS\nquantity\n, including street-view greenness, park density, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. Recent studies have examined\nquality\nfactors such as naturalness, colorfulness, and cleanliness, but evidence in this area remains limited [\n13\n]. Four European cities demonstrated significant links between mental health and qualitative and quantitative greenness indices like garden design, tree count, and blue space size [\n14\n]. Research on new housing development projects revealed no correlation between park density and psychological distress, yet distress declined in areas with high-quality, well-maintained parks [\n15\n]. These inconclusive findings suggest that green space has varying effects on mental health, influenced by its\nquality\nand\nquantity\n.\nIn China, research on UGS is mainly directed towards mainstream groups, with limited attention given to rural migrants [\n16\n]. This oversight fails to address the unique challenges migrants face in accessing greenspaces due to their socioeconomic disadvantages and housing constraints. The\nhukou\nsystem, China’s distinctive household registration framework, has historically institutionalized the rural-urban societal divide, restricting internal mobility and creating differential access to resources [\n17\n]. Consequently, rural migrants are more susceptible to physical deprivation than their local counterparts [\n2\n], stemming from their disadvantaged position in the local housing market and lack of social and financial support [\n18\n]. This disparity extends to UGS access, as evidenced by studies in major Chinese cities. Research in Wuhan revealed a negative correlation (coefficient − 2.79) between UGS accessibility and the proportion of migrants in neighborhoods [\n19\n]. Similarly, in Guangzhou, over half of the neighborhoods exhibited unequal access to UGS for migrants [\n20\n]. These environmental inequalities can exacerbate spatial polarization, potentially intensifying disparities between migrants and local residents [\n21\n]. Such social consequences may further deteriorate migrants’ mental health [\n22\n].\nOn the other hand, rural migrants’ persistent housing mobility frequently results in the unstable usage of UGS [\n23\n], potentially impacting their mental health [\n3\n]. This instability not only limits their physical activity and civic engagement [\n24\n], but also results in fleeting encounters between migrants and local residents [\n25\n]. These transient interactions hinder the development of social connections between the two groups, potentially eroding social cohesion and increasing mental health issues [\n26\n]. Given the social inequalities in UGS access and the insufficient usage by migrants due to their mobile nature, the\nquantity\nof UGS may play a more critical role in promoting health among rural migrants compared to local residents. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH1\nThe\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact the mental health of rural migrants. Of these two factors, the\nquantity\nexerts a more pronounced effect.\nExacerbating discrimination? The polarizing potential of green space in urban China\nWhile the social benefits of greenness are widely acknowledged [\n5\n,\n27\n], their potential to exacerbate socio-spatial issues (such as perceived discrimination and deriving exclusion), particularly for migrants, requires careful consideration. High-quality UGS can attract people to stay longer and engage in a range of spontaneous activities (e.g., walking) and optional activities (e.g., recreation), as well as social interactions [\n15\n,\n28\n]. Their health effects are determined by both their existence and the sociality it engenders [\n9\n,\n15\n,\n29\n]. Perceived discrimination, a formidable barrier to social integration, has sparked research interest in the social dynamics within UGS [\n5\n]. While studies from Ljubljana and Edinburgh suggested that suburban green spaces can reduce discrimination by encouraging citizen involvement [\n30\n], contrasting evidence reveals experiences of exclusion. For example, some Latino groups have reported feeling ‘out of place’, unwelcome, or marginalized when visiting parks [\n31\n].\nAs for China, housing market reforms have fueled socio-spatial stratification, exacerbating environmental injustice in urban areas [\n32\n], such as unequal access to UGS [\n33\n], which disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups such as migrants and low-income residents. Evidence from Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai repeatedly confirms this pattern: while the priority commonly enjoys high-quality gardens in their private communities [\n21\n], underprivileged individuals frequently fail to access similar amenities [\n34\n,\n35\n]. This disparity reinforces social polarization and perpetuates discrimination and exclusion through several spatial-social processes. A prime example is green privatization, often manifested in the proliferation of gated communities, which restricts public access to urban green spaces. This trend, often driven by market forces and neoliberal planning ideologies, results in a form of ‘green gentrification’ [\n36\n], where access to nature becomes a commodity reserved for the advantaged population. Physical barriers such as fences, walls, and strategically designed ‘soft’ landscaping elements serve to delineate social boundaries, control entry and exit of neighborhoods, and effectively limit opportunities for social interaction across socioeconomic/\nhukou\n-based lines [\n37\n]. This phenomenon is aptly illustrated in Wu et al.’s study of Beijing, which reveals how high-end gated communities create exclusionary enclaves with abundant green spaces, essentially privatizing what were once public amenities [\n21\n]. Beyond these physical barriers, hostile attitudes and discriminatory actions further restrict marginalized groups’ access to and enjoyment of green spaces. Activities perceived as disruptive and culturally discordant, associated with stigmatized status– such as square dancing in public parks–often provoke complaints and discriminatory responses [\n37\n,\n38\n]. These microaggressions, though seemingly subtle, contribute to a negative social climate for disadvantaged groups, discouraging their use of green spaces and furthering existing social exclusion. In more extreme cases, the stark reality of discrimination lies through veiled ways, such as warning signs, small advertisements, and strategically placed posters that implicitly or explicitly target specific racial groups or outsiders [\n39\n]. While these methods may not always constitute overt legal violations, they nonetheless contribute to a non-inclusive environment. This covert form of discrimination often operates through coded language, imagery, or spatial practices that reinforce existing social hierarchies and marginalize targeted neighborhoods. Such practices highlight the urgent need to address not only the physical but also the social consequences of UGS inequality.\nEven more problematic, the discrimination people experience in urban greenery isn’t localized; it impacts all walks of life [\n40\n,\n41\n]. For migrants, this effect is more inescapable, as their status often magnifies the social disparities in accessing UGS [\n42\n]. This increased vulnerability is not limited geographically and can have long-term consequences for health, well-being, and social mobility. For example, a study in Dongguan, China, utilizing semi-structured interviews with temporary migrant workers, found that while squares near factories provided space for congregation, socialization, and exercise, interactions remained largely segregated, with rural fellows sharing similar migration backgrounds and reporting minimal interaction with local residents [\n41\n]. Although participants recognized the health benefits of using the square, they also mentioned ongoing discrimination experiences permeating their daily urban lives. This aligns with Zhang’s (2022) argument that green spaces may become sites of social division [\n43\n]. Despite shared physical presence, diverse groups’ avoidance behaviors in these spaces can reinforce segregation and marginalization of immigrant minorities, extending beyond the public realm. These findings suggest that discrimination experiences, whether specific to green spaces or reflecting broader everyday realities, may significantly impact migrants’ mental health. However, further research is needed to explore more diverse narratives among rural migrants in urban China. Accordingly, our hypothesis is:\nH2\nUGS can indirectly affect the mental health of rural migrants through perceived everyday discrimination in urban China.\nThe Geo-Contextual determinants of health\nFurther, the relationships between UGS, the social mediator, and mental health may hold differences across rural-urban contexts [\n5\n,\n29\n,\n44\n]. These differences, on the one hand, are attributed to the unequal distribution of UGS between suburban and central areas. Evidence from European cities suggested that compared to urban areas, around 77% of the population residing in the rural-urban interface lacks adequate access to UGS [\n45\n], which could bring about health issues. In England, despite abundant greenery in suburban and rural areas, it neither influenced health outcomes nor showed differences between these two areas [\n29\n]. Nevertheless, this conclusion is not universally applicable. In some cases, socially and economically disadvantaged populations may have access to more greenery in less privileged areas than their counterparts. Residents living in affordable housing and urban villages in urban China—considered underprivileged groups—have access to higher vegetation coverage rates than other urban populations [\n46\n]. These findings suggest that the health effects of UGS may be context-dependent along the rural-urban gradient.\nOn the other hand, their contextual heterogeneity may also result in differing social implications [\n22\n]. For instance, Neier (2023) identified segregation-based environmental inequality in Vienna [\n47\n], while in Beijing, lower-income areas have significantly reduced access to UGS, exacerbating spatial polarization between the rich and poor [\n21\n]. Scholars contend that this unequal distribution of ‘environmental goods’ like UGS is not coincidental but a consequence of long-term discriminatory policies [\n48\n]. The environmental marginalization of migrants was caused by a lack of recognition of their civic rights and informal livelihood strategies [\n49\n]. Additionally, their limited political capital often prompts governments and developers to pursue a ‘path of least resistance’, minimizing expenditure on environmental improvements at the expense of vulnerable groups [\n50\n]. The social effects of greenness, interlinked with rural-urban contexts, collectively influence one’s mental health.\nThis study, therefore, examines the impact of UGS on rural migrants’ perceived everyday discrimination and mental health outcomes. It further elucidates the heterogeneity of urban environments through comparative analyses of inner-city and inner-suburban areas. Building on the literature reviewed above, we propose:\nH3\nThe direct and indirect health impacts of UGS differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburb, demonstrating the Geo-Contextualization of these effects.\nWe validate the three hypotheses above by utilizing multisource data, incorporating the social survey, geospatial information, and urban environmental management data collected in Wuhan (see Fig.\n1\n). Our findings underscore the necessity of inclusive planning, design, and management of UGS, advocating for a nuanced approach that accounts for the diverse attributes of greenness to which environmentally vulnerable groups are particularly sensitive.\nFig. 1\nResearch design diagram\nFull size image\nStudy design\nData sources\nWe chose Wuhan as the study area for three reasons. First, Wuhan is undergoing rapid urbanization, similar to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, and it is one of the major migrant-receiving cities in China. According to the seventh national population census in 2020, the number of migrants in Wuhan reached 7.02 million, accounting for 32% of the total population, higher than the percentage (19.79%) in 2000 from the fifth national population census [\n51\n]. Second, there is a considerable geographical disparity in the residential environments of rural migrants in Wuhan. Statistics show that 35.4% resided in old inner areas, 28.7% in urban-rural fringes, and 16.6% in urban villages and squatter settlements [\n52\n]. This environmental heterogeneity underscores the importance of examining health issues across different ecological contexts. Third, following the COVID-19 outbreak, building a healthy city has been a leading strategy for Wuhan’s development\nFootnote\n1\n. These features make Wuhan a typical case.\nThe spatial planning of Chinese cities follows a hierarchical structure: administrative districts, sub-districts (\nJiedao\ns), and neighborhoods. Our primary data comes from the ‘\nWuhan Neighborhood Environment and Migrants’ Quality of Life Survey\n’, conducted from September to November 2018. To sample participants, first, we selected ten\nJiedao\ns from seven inner-city and three inner-suburb districts. Second, we implemented a street-interception, face-to-face survey for each selected\nJiedao\nin specific neighborhoods. To ensure diverse representation among respondents, we administered the survey in the neighborhoods’ high-density areas frequented by a wide range of residents. These locations included entrances of grocery stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, parks, and areas adjacent to subway stations. Interviewers underwent specialized training to ensure consistent, unbiased respondent recruitment. The respondents were provided informed oral consent and received payment after the survey. The Ethics Committee of Wuhan University approved it. We cleaned the data by removing samples that completed the survey in an extremely short time or records with missing values, eventually obtaining 716 valid samples covering 60 neighborhoods. During the preliminary survey, we encountered several challenges specific to conducting door-to-door household surveys among migrant populations. These included the population’s high mobility, reluctance to participate due to defensive attitudes, incomplete registration information in neighborhood data, and our human and financial resources constraints. Consequently, we strategically adopted a street-intercept interview approach. To minimize selection bias, we carefully controlled age and gender balance during the survey, ensuring a sample that closely matched the demographics of the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) (Table\n1\n), strengthening the generalizability of our findings. The participants classified as rural migrants were selected based on the criteria that they were over 18 years old and had lived in Wuhan for at least six months without a Wuhan\nhukou\n, aligning with the definition of CMDS.\nApart from the survey data, we employed the following three datasets: (1) Parks’ social media rating data: we obtained it from the\nDianping\nplatform (\nhttps://www.dianping.com\n) tagged geo-location (one of the most informative life services and place rating websites in China) (LBSM)(August 2022); (2) Baidu Street view images (BSVs): we captured them from Baidu Maps (\nhttp://lbsyun.baidu.com/\n) (March 2021), the Chinese equivalent of Google Maps, which can offer diverse views and detailed information about the actual surroundings; (3) Neighborhood environment data: we obtained it from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center (October 2020). This dataset covers information on land use, land surface vegetation cover, buildings, road networks, etc.\nTo address the 0–3 year lag between health and environmental data collection (2019.1–2022.12), we analyzed UGS changes, finding minimal landscape alteration (Fig.\n2\n). While 28 new parks were added, none were within 800 m of sampled areas. Given this stability, and supported by existing research [\n8\n], we believe the time lag’s impact on health outcomes is negligible, maintaining the credibility of our conclusions for urban green space planning and public health policy.\nFig. 2\nChanges in UGS development within the sampled areas\nFull size image\nMeasures\nMental health\nMental health was measured by the established Chinese version [\n53\n] of the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [\n54\n]. Respondents rated the frequency of experiencing six positive (e.g., enjoying daily activities, feeling happy) (1 =\nnever\nto 5 =\nalways\n) and six negative (e.g., losing sleep due to anxiety, feeling nervous) emotions over the past 12 months. To minimize response bias, positive and negative items were clearly distinguished, and response scales were reversed for negative items (i.e., 5 =\nnever\nto 1 =\nalways\n). Moreover, to prevent individuals with severe mental illness from concealing or overestimating their mental health status, we emphasized the anonymity and confidentiality of responses throughout the survey. We calculated the final GHQ-12 score by summing all items, with higher scores indicating better mental health. This scale has demonstrated reliability in global public health research on migrant populations [\n3\n,\n55\n,\n56\n]. It has been instrumental in identifying individuals at risk of mental health difficulties and facilitating comparisons with other research.\nNeighborhood greenness exposure\nExisting literature proposes various frameworks for measuring greenness exposure, including both overhead-view and eye-level perspectives [\n28\n], as well as subjective and objective dimensions [\n3\n]. Given the Chinese government’s policy focus and ongoing scholarly debate on the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS for vulnerable groups, this study evaluates rural migrants’ greenness exposure along these two critical dimensions.\nThis study centered on four common aspects of the\nquality\nof UGS [\n9\n,\n57\n]: overall satisfaction, social media ratings, greenspace disorder, and the presence of recreational plaza-type parks. Specifically, the overall satisfaction with UGS was measured by a 5-point Likert scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 5 = totally satisfied) based on the question, ‘How satisfied are you with the quality of greenspace in your neighborhood?’. Additionally, to capture public perceptions of park quality, we incorporated user-generated social media ratings from the\nDianping\nwebsite. This platform features anonymous reviews of parks, incorporating aspects like cost, aesthetics, and activity offerings. We calculated a weighted average rating for each neighborhood based on the five nearest parks, employing an inverse distance weighting method, as showed in Equation.\nA1\n, Appendix. Parks were weighted at 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1 [\n58\n], respectively, according to their proximity (calculated using road network distances) to the neighborhood centroid. The farthest park analyzed was within a 4.17 km radius, accessible within 30–60 min by public transportation [\n59\n]. This accessibility criterion ensured all parks were reachable within a reasonable timeframe, justifying our decision to set the weight of the fifth park to 0.1 instead of 0. Drawing upon established audit tools [\n9\n,\n57\n], we quantified greenspace disorder using data on environmental enforcement actions related to UGS management. This dataset, provided by the Wuhan City Urban Management and Law Enforcement Commission, documented instances of littering, solid waste accumulation, and maintenance issues (e.g., bare vegetation, inadequate facilities, or lighting) in UGS within an 800 m radius of each neighborhood. A higher density of reported cases signifies greater disorder within the UGS. Recreational plaza-type parks were identified as a crucial indicator of UGS quality. Park boundaries were extracted from remote sensing imagery, the Gaode Map platform, and the Wuhan City Park Directory (see Fig.\nA1\n, Appendix). We classified parks based on the ‘Urban Green Area Classification Standard CJJ/T 85-2017’\nFootnote\n2\nreleased by China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. This variable was operationalized as a binary indicator (1 = presence, 0 = absence).\nTo measure the\nquantity\nof UGS, we employed three widely used metrics [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]: park density, park area ratio, and the Green View Index (GVI). These measures allow for meaningful comparisons with other studies and contexts. We calculated park density as the number of parks within an 800 m radius buffer around each neighborhood centroid. Park locations were extracted from points of interest (POIs) accessed through the Baidu Map API. The park area ratio, calculated as the proportion of land dedicated to parks, was derived using GIS data on land use classification obtained from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center. To quantify the visibility of greenery, we computed the GVI using Baidu Street View imagery [\n10\n]. Data collection points were established at 100-meter intervals along the road network within the 800 m buffer. At each point, we captured panoramic street-level images (500 × 500 pixels) in four cardinal directions (90°, 180°, 270°, 360°) using a Python script. We then employed a fully convolutional neural network (FCN-8s) for semantic segmentation, enabling the identification and extraction of green elements (e.g., trees, grass) within each image [\n10\n]. The GVI at each point was computed as the average proportion of green pixels across the four directional images. The neighborhood-level GVI was then determined by averaging the GVIs of all collection points within the corresponding buffer zone.\nPrior research has employed diverse definitions of ‘neighborhood,’ including Transportation Analysis Zones (\nTAZ\ns), zip codes, census tracts, blocks,\nJiedao\ns, and radial buffers ranging from 100 m to 2 km. Given the focus of this study on creating health-oriented neighborhoods, we defined ‘neighborhood’ using an 800 m radius buffer. This decision aligns with Wuhan’s ‘\nPlanning Action for 15-Minute Community Life Circle\n’ (2018), which designates a 500–800 m radius as the primary daily living space based on a 15-minute walking distance. This operationalization enhances the practical implications of our findings for urban planning and public health initiatives.\nPerceived everyday discrimination\nWe measured perceived everyday discrimination (PED) by adapting the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) [\n60\n]. This adapted scale, reflecting prevalent discrimination issues reported by Chinese migrants, comprises three items quantifying respondents’ experiences of being disliked, treated with contempt, and facing reluctance from the local population as neighbors. Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with higher summed scores indicating greater perceived discrimination. While this measure captures general daily discrimination rather than being green space-specific, we argue for its ecological validity as our study is situated within a broader investigation of neighborhood environments and migrant quality of life in Wuhan. Discrimination experienced by migrants permeates various aspects of daily life [\n40\n], including but not limited to UGS interactions operating within a broader social and spatial context. Literature also suggests that UGS-related discrimination often extends beyond geographical boundaries [\n2\n]. Examining everyday discrimination provides a more comprehensive lens for understanding environmental injustice experienced by migrants in urban settings.\nSociodemographic covariates\nWe included a set of individual characteristics as control variables [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n28\n], such as age, gender, and educational status (Table\n1\n). Personal annual income was also considered a dichotomy based on Wuhan’s per capita yearly income 2019\nFootnote\n3\n. A value of 1 (High) was assigned to the income above the average (≥ 50,000 CNY), while a value of 0 (Low) was given to the income below the average (<50,000 CNY). We grouped the residential location into inner-city (0) and inner-suburb (1).\nTable 1 Summary of variable statistics\nFull size table\nData analysis and modeling approach\nOur data analysis comprised three main steps. First, we performed descriptive analyses using\nChi\n-square and\nt\n-tests to examine statistical differences in UGS, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health across rural-urban contexts. Second, to address the hierarchical nature of our data (individuals nested within neighborhoods), we aggregated environmental data captured by each individual response to the neighborhood level. This aggregation was done by calculating the mean score for each environmental variable within each unique neighborhood identifier, effectively transitioning from individual-level to neighborhood-level data. Third, we applied Multilevel Structural Equation Models (MSEM) to test our hypotheses by examining the relationships between greenness exposure, the mediator, and mental health outcomes among rural migrants. We estimated the significance of each pathway, indirect effects, and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Multiple models were conducted to compute direct, indirect, and total effects within each pathway, considering different residential locations to understand their varying impacts in rural-urban contexts. The Variance Inflation Factor (\nVIF\n) for all variables averaged 1.4 (below the threshold of 5), suggesting the absence of severe multicollinearity. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16 [\n61\n], employing commands such as ‘ttest’, ‘gsem’, and ‘nlcom’.\nResults\nSample characteristics and contextual differences\nTable\n1\nprovides the descriptive statistics. The average score of the GHQ-12 was 46.42 (SD ± 5.03), close to the health score’s median value. 15.82% of the respondents reported having ‘always’ and ‘often’ lost much sleep due to over-anxiety and ‘feelings of nervousness,’ indicating that rural migrants in Wuhan generally experienced unsatisfactory mental health and some emotional distress. Additionally, groups residing in the inner-city exhibited more favorable mental health.\nFor the UGS\nquality\n, the average score of the general satisfaction and parks’ social media rating was 3.45 (SD ± 0.49) and 4.33 (SD ± 0.35), respectively. The average number of environmental management cases reported by residents was 2.86; over half of the neighborhoods (56.70%) had urban management problems with greening (with values exceeding 1). Only 30.59% had recreational plaza-type parks. For the\nquantity\n, the park density, park area ratio, and GVI averaged at 1.10 (SD ± 1.45), 0.09 (SD ± 0.16), and 0.28 (SD ± 0.07), respectively.\nTable\n2\nillustrates the disparities in UGS characteristics across rural-urban contexts. Inner-city neighborhoods, where migrant workers reside, exhibited higher park density (by 1.12 units) and park area ratio (by 0.06) compared to inner-suburban areas. Conversely, the inner-suburb demonstrated a significantly higher green view index (by 0.05 units). Qualitatively, inner-city respondents reported greater perceived greenery satisfaction (by 0.38) and higher park social media ratings (by 0.23). However, these areas also faced more greenspace disorder issues, with environmental management cases exceeding those in inner-suburban areas by 1.01. Inner-suburban areas, in contrast, featured a higher proportion of recreational plaza-type parks. These findings reveal unequal access to UGS among migrant populations across the rural-urban continuum.\nAdditionally, rural migrants experience a moderate everyday discrimination from local residents, with an average score of 6.40 (SD ± 1.90) out of 15. While the difference isn’t statistically significant, the data indicates a potential trend where migrants in inner-suburban areas may face slightly higher levels of discrimination than those in inner-city areas. This marginal difference of 0.21 could be explored further in future research to determine its significance and potential underlying factors.\nTable 2 Greeness exposure, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health: rural-urban context differences\nFull size table\nModel parameter estimates\nWe ran the model of the direct health effects of UGS, accounting for covariates. Subsequently, the model was re-estimated to include the discrimination factor as a mediator. Model fit was evaluated by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (\nAIC\n) and Bayesian Information Criterion (\nBIC\n) across the two models [\n62\n], with lower values indicating better model fit. As shown in Table\n3\n, across both the overall sample and the subsamples categorized by residential location, models incorporating perceived discrimination (Models 2, 4, 6) exhibited lower\nAIC\nand\nBIC\nvalues compared to those without (Models 1, 3, 5), suggesting its potential role as a social mediator in these associations.\nTable 3 Model fitting parameters\nFull size table\nModeling results: associations between UGS, discrimination, and mental health\nTable\n4\npresents the detailed modeling results, illustrating the direct, indirect, and total effects. As hypothesized (\nH1\n) and evidenced by the model, the\nquantity\nof UGS demonstrates a more decisive influence on the mental health of rural migrants in Wuhan compared to\nquality\naspects, partially contradicting previous studies on the general population [\n14\n,\n15\n]. However, these effects differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburban areas (Tables\nA1\nand\nA2\n, see Appendix), highlighting the importance of considering the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS concerning the Geo-Contextualization of health effects.\nSpecifically, high park density was significantly and positively correlated with mental health among rural migrants overall (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.119,\np\n< 0.05), with a stronger effect in the inner-city area (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.412,\np\n< 0.01, Appendix, Table\nA1\n). Additionally, each percentage point increase in GVI was associated with a 8.45-point rise in mental health scores, a benefit particularly evident in suburban areas. However, the relationship between\nquantity\nand mental health is not always straightforward. Unexpectedly, a larger park area ratio is associated with poorer mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= -3.611,\np\n< 0.1), especially for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -7.568,\np\n< 0.05, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding challenges previous studies [\n4\n,\n7\n] and suggests that simply increasing park size may not necessarily translate into better health, particularly in areas already abundant in greenness.\nDespite the dominant influence of\nquantity\n,\nqualitative\naspects of UGS also demonstrate significant, albeit context-dependent, associations with mental health. Social media ratings of parks show a significant, positive association with mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= 2.142,\np\n< 0.01), but only in inner-suburban neighborhoods (\nβ\ndirect\n= 6.019,\np\n-value = 0.015, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding suggests that living near highly-rated parks, especially those praised for their scenery, aesthetics, and overall attractiveness, may significantly improve mental health for inner-suburban migrants. Interestingly, perceived greenery satisfaction holds a nanced relationship. While generally positive, this relationship becomes significantly negative within the inner-city (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.137,\np\n-value = 0.056). This could be attributed to the confounding influence of housing market dynamics, where high greenspace satisfaction often coincides with elevated property values, potentially offsetting the mental health benefits [\n63\n]. Furthermore, the mental health benefits of recreational plaza-type parks appear to be context-dependent, specifically benefiting inner-city migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= 0.996,\np\n< 0.1) while not showing the same effect, and potentially even a slightly negative (although statistically insignificant) one, for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.253,\np\n> 0.1).\nTable 4 Results of MSEM in direct, indirect, and total effects\nFull size table\nFurthermore, our findings confirm\nH2\nand\nH3\nabout the role of perceived everyday discrimination in the relationship between UGS and mental health, and reveal critical differences between urban and suburban areas. In suburban areas, urban greenery more directly benefits mental health. However, in inner-city areas, the experience of discrimination plays a crucial mediating role. Specifically, for inner-city migrants, living near parks with recreational plazas is linked to better mental health, partly because it reduces experiences of discrimination (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.332, 95% CI: 0.060 to 0.605, Appendix Table\nA1\n). This contrasts sharply with rural migrants, especially those in inner-suburban areas, who showed a strong negative correlation between perceived discrimination and mental health (Fig. 3). While some trends suggested that greenspaces with favorable social media ratings (suburban) and satisfaction (inner-city) might also reduce discriminatory experiences (Fig.\n3\n), these did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, while access to high-quality UGS may lessen the negative mental health impacts of discrimination, particularly for inner-city migrants, this effect is not consistently observed across all rural-urban settings.\nWhile UGS\nquality\ngenerally produces the positive social outcomes, the relationship between their\nquantity\nand social dynamics is more nuanced. The social functions of UGS, such as reducing discrimination, appear to reverse under certain quantitative conditions. A high proportion of greenness, particularly in the inner-city (\nβ\nindirect\n= -0.965, 95% CI: -1.843 to -0.087, Appendix Table\nA1\n), was associated with increased perceived discrimination and consequently poorer mental health. This phenomenon may be attributed to these areas primarily serving as city-level parks [\n59\n], where proximate neighborhoods have experienced social segregation related to household registration or income, thereby amplifying discrimination and adversely impacting rural migrants’ mental health. Conversely, higher park density was linked to lower perceived discrimination and improved mental health (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.078, 95% CI: -0.084 to 0.239, Table\n4\n), suggesting that accessible UGS can facilitate social integration.\nUltimately, this study highlights the health influence of both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of UGS and differs across specific urban-rural contexts. In inner-suburban areas, proximity to moderately sized parks but high social media ratings and visibility significantly contributes to positive mental health outcomes for migrants. Conversely, in inner-city areas, high park density and recreational plaza-type parks prove more beneficial. Perceived discrimination emerges as a critical psychosocial mechanism. Neighborhood parks designed as recreational squares can indirectly promote mental health by mitigating perceived discrimination. However, a high proportion of UGS in an area may inadvertently exacerbate social segregation, negatively impacting mental health. These findings emphasize that the effective green spaces planning must consider their both\nquality\nand\nquantity\nacross different urban zones to maximize health benefits for rural migrants.\nFig. 3\nSignificant pathways across rural-urban contexts. *\np\n< 0.1; **\np\n< 0.05; ***\np\n< 0.01\nFull size image\nDiscussions\nUnder the ‘mobility turn’ in environmental health studies, the importance of neighborhood greenness exposure for rural migrants’ mental health has received growing attention. Taking Wuhan as a typical case, our study reveals that both the\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact migrants’ mental health, with\nquantity\ndemonstrating a stronger correlation. This contrasts with findings from low-density cities, such as those in the Netherlands [\n9\n] and Australia [\n15\n], where the\nquality\nhas been strongly influenced. The inconclusive results can be attributed to the city-specific urban form and the progress made in greening. The high-density built environment, fragmented spatial layout resulting from the presence of rivers and lakes, and transportation challenges inherent to Wuhan exemplify how these factors can exacerbate unequal access to UGS. These findings underscore the urgency for Wuhan to prioritize equitable green space development.\nA focus on detailed information revealed that only the social media ratings of parks exerted a positive influence. Unexpectedly, a higher proportion of park area was linked to poorer mental health. This finding corroborates extant literature suggesting a non-linear correlation between UGS and psychological well-being, aligning with the hypothesized ‘Greenery Saturation Effect’. The theory suggests that surpassing an optimal UGS exposure threshold may elicit adverse emotional responses [\n64\n]. Various studies provide evidence for this effect. For instance, Australian children’s happiness peaked with 21–40% green space coverage [\n65\n], while older adults’ overall health was optimal at an NDVI of 0.4 [\n66\n]. Exceeding these levels may yield diminishing returns or even detrimental effects on mental health. Several factors could explain this counterintuitive relationship. Larger parks often struggle with adequate security and lighting, potentially increasing crime risk and residents’ fear and stress [\n67\n]. For migrants in particular, extensive parklands may paradoxically restrict their opportunities for interaction with local residents, thus contributing to social isolation and negatively impacting mental health. Moreover, as illustrated by our fieldwork (Fig.\n4\n), prioritizing UGS for vulnerable groups concentrated in urban villages and affordable housing can strain municipal budgets. This financial burden often results in inadequate maintenance, reduced amenities, and diminished UGS quality, thereby undermining the intended health benefits. In conclusion, while green spaces generally support mental health, their effectiveness depends on factors beyond mere\nquantity\n, including\nquality\nand social considerations.\nFig. 4\nObservations of UGS conditions in migrant settlements (July 2021) By author.\nNote\nurban villages in the inner-city (Left) and affordable housing neighborhoods in the inner-suburb (Right)\nFull size image\nWe also observe the health effects of UGS differing along the rural-urban gradient. In inner-city areas, a higher density of parks directly promotes migrants’ mental health. Conversely, in suburban areas, the quality of parks, as indicated by social media ratings, has a more significant positive impact. This disparity can be attributed to Wuhan’s uneven distribution of ecological resources, particularly its circular arrangement of larger, more ecological suburban parks, contributes to this disparity\nFootnote\n4\n. While expansive, these parks face management and social functionality challenges. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between suburban migrants’ mental health and park area proportion, potentially due to increased exposure to fragmented greenness. Limited mobility in transit deserts may further exacerbate this issue [\n68\n]. These differing inner-city and suburban outcomes highlight divergent social processes. Inner-city green spaces can mitigate the mental health impacts of daily discrimination, an effect absent in suburban settings. This discrepancy likely stems from two interconnected factors related to Wuhan’s suburban environment: its rural-like nature, which can exacerbate migrants’ social withdrawal [\n41\n], and its highly segregated socio-spatial structure [\n69\n]. Both contribute to migrants interacting almost exclusively within their own identity group, thus impairing their sense of place and belonging. Consequently, suburban green spaces, despite their potential, minimally buffer the mental health impacts of discrimination among migrants compared to inner-city counterparts.\nThis study offers threefold contributions to the understanding of the health effects of UGS on the migrant population: (1) Geo-Contextualization of health effects: We demonstrate that the mental health outcomes of rural-to-urban migrants in urban China are significantly influenced by their residential location (inner-city vs. inner-suburb), highlighting the context-dependent nature of individual outcomes. (2) Nuanced green space impacts: While affirming the general health benefits of UGS for rural migrants, an overabundance of greenery, particularly in suburban areas, can be detrimental. Urban planning must balance UGS\nquality\nand\nquantity\n. (3) Contextual moderation of discrimination: We uncover spatially heterogeneous effects, with social mechanisms, such as reduced perceived everyday discrimination, driving the health benefits of UGS in inner-city areas. Conversely, in inner-suburban areas, these benefits manifest more directly, reflecting the influence of localized landscape characteristics and population distribution. This research builds upon and refines existing studies on the diverse health impacts of UGS across rural-urban gradients, emphasizing the need for context-specific urban planning interventions.\nDespite the study’s contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, while widely used, self-reported measures like the GHQ-12 are susceptible to response bias. Future research would benefit from incorporating additional mental health instruments, such as the GAD-7 and PSS, for cross-validation and exploring migrant-specific mental health concerns. Secondly, although socioeconomic variables were controlled for, the potential impact of mobility experience on rural migrants’ mental health warrants further investigation. Finally, due to data limitations restricting analysis to UGS presence, this study may underestimate migrants’ frequency and duration of UGS use. Future studies should collect detailed usage information to better understand its relationship with mental health, considering both availability and actual utilization.\nThese findings have several policy implications for developing healthy and inclusive cities. Firstly, while increasing urban green space is generally beneficial, a nuanced approach to balancing quantity with strategic quality enhancements is crucial. Policies should prioritize optimizing park density, visibility, and social value to cultivate positive public perception, particularly for environmentally disadvantaged populations. Secondly, designing inclusive and social green spaces is essential to mitigate potential discriminatory practices. This involves prioritizing human-scale designs that promote interaction and discourage territorial behavior. Additionally, government and community-led programming can foster social cohesion and intercultural exchange, cultivating a sense of belonging among migrants. Lastly, embracing context-specific design is vital. Inner-city interventions should focus on increasing park density through pocket parks and recreational plazas, while suburban strategies should enhance the social functionality of existing green spaces through improved amenities and engaging activities. By tailoring green space design to specific user groups and settings, cities can maximize the positive impact of these spaces on community well-being and social integration.\nData availability\nThe data is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions.

        "abstract": "The provision and management of urban green infrastructure (UGI) provides multiple benefits to the wellbeing of urban residents. A crucial, yet underexplored benefit, is the role that UGI can play in poverty alleviation. Acknowledging this role raises questions as to how UGI design and management can better provide opportunities for poverty alleviation and how it varies across UGI types and contexts. We consider this, using South Africa as an example, for five dimensions of poverty alleviation, namely (i) contributions to cash or non-cash income; (ii) increased opportunities for skills development and learning; (iii) improved physical and mental health; (iv) lessening of vulnerability and risk, and (v) increased opportunities to participate in decision-making. We do this for six types of UGI (amenity spaces, blue infrastructure, natural/semi-natural lands, urban parks, urban agriculture, and verges). We collectively ranked the current and future potential for poverty alleviation and the extent of change required to achieve the ranked potential for each UGI type. Urban agriculture was scored as having the highest current potential to contribute to poverty alleviation, and verges the least. In contrast, the ranking indicates that adopting pro-poor designs and principles will have the greatest returns per effort in parks and amenity spaces. But the widespread distribution and large extent of verges make them key areas for pro-poor interventions. Overall, we found that greater investment and changes in attitudes of authorities would have the greatest impact in poverty alleviation in all types of UGI, rather than policy and procedures around UGI design and management. We conclude that although the various types of UGI have markedly different potentials to contribute to poverty alleviation, there are some overarching strategies that planners and managers could adopt to promote poverty alleviation through UGI design and management.",

Types of UGI used to assess their potential to contribute to poverty alleviation (adapted from Jones et al., 2022). UGI type Brief description Natural & semi-natural spaces Typically, large (but not always so) green areas dominated by natural or semi-natural vegetation, with relatively low levels of transformation and relatively extensive (as opposed to intensive) management (e.g. forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, abandoned or ruderal areas, as well as those with limited vegetation such as sand dunes and rocky areas Parks & public gardens Multifunctional green spaces of varying sizes, ranging from pocket parks to large botanical, historical and recreational gardens Amenity spaces Public institutional green spaces designed or managed with an overriding key purpose, for example, sports fields/grounds, playgrounds, clinic and school gardens, cemeteries Verges Continuous or discontinuous strips of vegetation, hedges or trees along roads, streets, pathways, trails, railways, canals, waterways, streams Urban agriculture Public, collective or individually managed land parcels to provide regularly harvested products (e.g. crops, flowers, fruits, timber, biofuels, animals) for home use or sale Blue infrastructure Permanently or seasonally inundated water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, estuaries, oceans, dams, wetlands, bogs, fens, canals, bioswales 3.

        "abstract": "Air pollution is a critical global issue with extensive implications beyond respiratory health, significantly affecting neurological and psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence establishes a link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM < 2.5 µm), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and heightened risks of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Mechanistic pathways include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Epidemiological studies indicate increased susceptibility among urban residents, particularly men, middle-aged individuals, and married persons, to the mental health impacts of air pollution. Additionally, socioeconomic factors, such as GDP per capita, access to health resources, green spaces, and sports facilities, modulate these health outcomes. Addressing this public health challenge necessitates stricter industrial emission controls, sustainable agricultural practices, promotion of cleaner energy sources, and incorporation of pollution exposure history into clinical assessments. Enhanced public awareness and interdisciplinary research are vital for mitigating the detrimental effects of air pollution on neurological and psychiatric health, ultimately striving for a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.",

Impact of air pollution on neurological and psychiatric disorders Type of pollution Mechanism Neurological disease Impact on pathogenesis Air pollution (PM 2.5, PM 10, SO2, NO2, O3) Neuroinflammation and Neurotoxicity due to PM 2.5 and PM 10 Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Increased risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Associated with decreased cognitive function. Mechanisms include systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. Air pollution exposure contributes to metabolic abnormalities, neuronal insulin resistance, and amyloid beta accumulation, leading to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.   Schizophrenia Higher rates of mental illness among urban residents, including schizophrenia. Short-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of outpatient visits due to schizophrenia.   ADHD PM exposure is associated with higher incidence of ADHD,. PM exposure in late pregnancy is associated with reduced corpus callosum area and higher hyperactivity subscores.   Neurodevelopment Airborne fine PM contains neurotoxic substances that affect neural development. Exposure during pregnancy is associated with permanent brain damage and cognitive impairment. Fine dust exposure during fetal development is associated with neurodevelopmental delay.   Stroke Exposure to PM2.5 and nitrates is associated with the incidence and severity of stroke. Short-term exposure to SO2, NO2, and PM10 is significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. Elevated heart rate, increased ates of heart block frequency, and atrial fibrillation observed with exposure to toxic components. Long-term exposure to black carbon associated with the incidence of ischemic stroke.   Parkinson's disease Exposure to airborne pollutants is associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease.   Multiple sclerosis (MS) PM implicated as a risk factor for MS. Epidemiological surveys suggest that air pollution may contribute to the pathophysiology of MS, possibly through inflammation and oxidative stress. There are contradictory findings regarding the association between air pollution components and MS prevalence, and further studies are warranted.  Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Air pollution induces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.   Schizophrenia Air pollution triggers inflammatory responses that exacerbate symptoms of schizophrenia.   ADHD PMexposure is associated with systemic inflammation, which may contribute to the onset of ADHD.   Neurodevelopment Exposure to air pollution leads to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, affecting brain development.  Mitochondrial dysfunction Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease PM exposure interferes with mitochondrial function, reducing ATP production and increasing tau phosphorylation, contributing to neurodegeneration.   ADHD PM exposure may alter mitochondrial function, impacting brain development and the onset of ADHD.  Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Air pollutants disrupt BBB function, allowing neurotoxic substances and inflammatory mediators to enter the brain, contributing to neurodegeneration.   Schizophrenia Air pollution alters BBB function, facilitating the entry of neurotoxic substances and inflammatory mediators, exacerbating schizophrenia symptoms.   Neurodevelopment Air pollutants damage BBB integrity, leading to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, affecting brain development.

This study examines how environmental issues and related injustices are surfacing in U.S. social work practice and social work readiness to respond, and what resources social workers are most interested in. Data are from an online survey of U.S. social workers (N = 337) in Colorado, Ohio, and Tennessee. Participants answered questions about their social work background, current job, environmental issues in practice, resources, and demographics. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. For nine issues, at least 30% of participants reported these as surfacing sometimes or often, with the highest being poor food access (74.7%), extreme cold (58.8%), and poor green space access (43.9%). The extent varied by years of experience, job setting, and practice level. Meanwhile, fewer than 40% of social workers indicated that they were somewhat or very prepared to respond to eight out of nine issues. Interest was higher in the resources that could be used for responding to specific topics rather than environmental justice broadly.

This study examines how environmental issues and related injustices are surfacing in U.S. social work practice and social work readiness to respond, and what resources social workers are most interested in. Data are from an online survey of U.S. social workers (N = 337) in Colorado, Ohio, and Tennessee. Participants answered questions about their social work background, current job, environmental issues in practice, resources, and demographics. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. For nine issues, at least 30% of participants reported these as surfacing sometimes or often, with the highest being poor food access (74.7%), extreme cold (58.8%), and poor green space access (43.9%). The extent varied by years of experience, job setting, and practice level. Meanwhile, fewer than 40% of social workers indicated that they were somewhat or very prepared to respond to eight out of nine issues. Interest was higher in the resources that could be used for responding to specific topics rather than environmental justice broadly. In addition to strengthening social work education regarding environmental justice, this study suggests that national, state, and local social work associations can—in partnership with growing numbers of social work scholars working on environmental justice—create and provide training, templates, and guidance for practitioners that are tailored to specific environmental justice issues.\nKeywords:\nclimate change\n;\ncold\n;\nenvironmental justice\n;\nfood insecurity\n;\ngreen space\n;\nhealth\n;\nheat\n;\nsocial work practice\n;\nsustainability\n;\nweather extremes\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental justice is the philosophy that all peoples and communities are entitled to equal protection under environmental health laws and regulations [\n1\n]. Meanwhile, environmental injustice is the disproportionate and unfair distribution of environment-related harms and unhealthy conditions. Both are social justice issues that social work must address for improved quality of life and sustainable wellbeing, especially for the minoritized communities whom social workers tend to serve, and to move towards the creation of a healthy and regenerative world [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n].\nSocial and health impact research finds that low-income persons and people of color are disproportionately exposed to pollution, contamination, toxic waste, and other forms of environmental degradation [\n8\n,\n9\n]. They are also less likely to have access to environmental amenities, such as parks, tree cover, and green spaces [\n10\n]. In the United States, for example, 68% of racially marginalized people live in nature-deprived areas [\n11\n]. During extreme heat, people with lower incomes sometimes forego air conditioning because they cannot afford higher utility bills [\n12\n,\n13\n]. Children, older adults, and people with chronic health conditions are at greater risk to the health effects of outdoor air pollution [\n14\n]. Also, as climate change increases the likelihood of weather extremes in many areas, it is historically redlined communities in the U.S. that are often at the greatest risk, due to decades of disinvestment in green space and tree cover and also due to public policies that built concrete and asphalt structures and highways through or surrounding already marginalized communities [\n15\n]. In these ways and others, environmental injustices can reinforce or exacerbate existing social, racial, economic, and health disparities.\nSocial workers, traditionally concerned with the promotion of human rights and social justice, are primed to be strong partners in responding to environmental injustice and supporting environmental justice movements [\n16\n,\n17\n], from helping clients cope with the impacts of environmental inequities to partnering with communities and advocating for policy change [\n18\n,\n19\n]. Over the past decade, national social work organizations in the United States have increased their attention on environmental issues. The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) included environmental justice for the first time in its 2015 competencies for social work education. In 2016, the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare included “Create Social Responses to a Changing Environment” as a Grand Challenge for Social Work. CSWE [\n20\n] published its Environmental Justice Curricular Guide in 2020, and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) included recommendations for environmental and climate justice in its 2021 Blueprint of Federal Social Policy Priorities [\n21\n].\nMeanwhile, little is still known about how social workers experience or respond to environmental issues and related injustices in their professional practice. Through a survey of social workers in three U.S. states—selected for their demographic, climate, and political characteristics—this study aims to understand the experiences and needs of social workers as related to environmental justice in an array of practice settings. Through this inquiry, this study aims to advance how the profession can better reach social workers with the knowledge, skills, and resources to advance environmental justice, ultimately reducing associated health, mental health, and other disparities.\n1.1. Social Work Research on Environmental Issues\nSocial work research related to environmental issues has increased over the past decade and has often focused on describing problems, documenting disparities, or examining topics such as specific disaster events, food or water insecurity, natural resources, or the transition away from fossil fuel dependency [\n4\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n]. Another research focus has been the integration of environmental topics in social work education [\n26\n], with scholars examining student perceptions of environmental issues (e.g., [\n27\n]), the extent of faculty inclusion of environmental justice in their teaching (e.g., [\n28\n]), or environment-related teaching strategies or activities (e.g., [\n29\n]).\nYet, clear explications of how environmental issues are arising in social work practice across an array of practice settings are rare, even though social workers are often first responders in disaster-related crises (e.g., [\n30\n]) or are engaged in community-level initiatives that may intersect with the natural or built environment (e.g., [\n31\n]). Of note, two recent exceptions to this, both outside the U.S., are national surveys in Finland [\n32\n] and Australia [\n33\n], which include some aspects of how environmental issues are impacting clients or how human service professionals (including social workers) are responding.\nAs a professional discipline, social work scholarship must be practice informed and seek to inform practice through concrete application so that social work practice continues to develop and improve. With the extent and impact of environmental injustices sharply on the rise, particularly amidst the global climate crisis, the need for practice-relevant research on this issue is critical so that social workers can directly support clients and communities experiencing environment-related harms and mobilize and act for environmental justice.\nIn reviewing the literature, we found only three surveys of U.S. social workers and one survey of U.S. counseling professionals, which included licensed social workers, about this topic that were conducted in a way that sought more generalized information about practice (i.e., in lieu of case studies of specific disaster events, environmental crises, or experiences in a single population or community). All four studies were published between 2013 and 2023, and the first three focused on social workers in a single state, and none differentiated among practice types or settings.\nIn the first study, Shaw [\n34\n] surveyed NASW members in California (N = 373) and found that over 90% incorporated the natural environment into client assessments, although about two-thirds did not assess for dangerous chemicals in the home, accessibility to clean water, or proximity to pollution sites. Shaw [\n34\n] also found that respondents tended to be environmentally friendly and supportive of environmental topics being incorporated into social work training, although they also tended not to be involved in environmental justice activism.\nIn an unidentified midwestern state, Nesmith and Smyth [\n35\n] surveyed state-licensed social workers (N = 373), with 71% reporting that they had at least one client experiencing an environmental injustice issue. Commonly reported hazards included food deserts, lack of safe outdoor spaces for children, lead poisoning, air pollution, and extreme weather [\n35\n]. The authors also found that respondents agreed that environmental justice is important to the profession, while also experiencing frustration that environmental issues affected their clients’ access to basic needs and fostered feelings of powerlessness to affect change. Respondent recommendations for social work practitioners included raising awareness and pursuing community organizing and advocacy [\n35\n].\nIn a study of social workers in Alaska (N = 159), Allen [\n36\n] found that 69% of respondents perceive climate change as a “medium or large” threat to their clients and constituents, and 60% reported “few or some” clients discussing issues related to climate change. Other environmental issues reported by social workers in the study included food insecurity, extreme weather (e.g., wildfires, erosion, and floods), and community infrastructure problems such as transportation delays, road damage, loss of electric power, and damage to homes due to environmental hazards. Allen [\n36\n] also found linkages among environmental issues, cultural loss, and mental or behavioral health concerns such as anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol misuse, and suicidal ideation, especially among Alaskan Native peoples.\nFinally, in a four-state study of counseling professionals, including licensed social workers, Reese et al. [\n37\n] found that 5% of respondents had climate-related training, less than 10% had educational resources on climate change to use in practice, and 46% did not feel competent to respond to climate issues in counseling. Meanwhile, 79% of respondents wanted additional research on mental health impacts of the climate crisis, and 76% expressed interest in fact sheets on the topic [\n37\n].\nTaken together, these studies suggest that the interest in and need for practice-relevant tools related to environmental issues among social workers may be high, and concrete knowledge, engagement, or readiness to intervene is likely low [\n34\n,\n35\n,\n36\n,\n37\n]. Given that the three studies exclusive to social work focused on single states (Alaska, California, and an unnamed Midwestern state), we expanded the sampling approach of the present study to three states (Colorado, Ohio, and Tennessee) to capture a broader array of social workers and used recruitment methods intended to capture the experiences and needs of social workers in a variety of practice settings and types so that similarities or differences by practice characteristics could be explored.\n1.2. Study Purpose and Questions\nThe reach of environmental crises and their impacts are on the rise, and while social work research and education related to this has increased, there is a need to understand the scope of environmental issues in current social work practice to inform new ways of reaching social work practitioners with the information they need to respond effectively. To date, research on this intersection has been limited, and, when conducted, study samples have tended to be from a single U.S. state at a time and have focused on social workers as a single group without examining how responses may vary by aspects of practice setting or type. Through a study of social workers across an array of practice settings in three U.S. states, this study addresses the following research questions:\nTo what extent and in what ways do social workers perceive that environmental issues are surfacing in social work practice?\nTo what extent do social workers feel prepared to respond to environmental issues in their practice, and what actions have they taken?\nWhat resources or training related to environmental issues are practicing social workers interested in?\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Sampling and Recruitment\nData are from online surveys completed by U.S. social workers living in Colorado, Ohio, and Tennessee from January to April 2023. States were selected for the range of their demographic, climate, and political characteristics, and to leverage the study authors’ pre-existing relationships and networks in these states. While the population in each state is predominately White (ranging from 67% to 73%), Colorado has a relatively higher Hispanic or Latino population (22.5%) compared to 4.5% in Ohio and 6.4% in Tennessee. Meanwhile, the latter two states have a relatively higher population of Black or African American residents at 13.3% and 16.7%, respectively, compared to 4.7% in Colorado [\n38\n]. On other demographic measures, Colorado has a lower poverty rate (9.3%) and higher bachelor’s degree completion rate (43.7%, of people 25 years and older), compared to both Ohio (13.3% and 30.4%, respectively) and Tennessee (14.0% and 29.7%, respectively) [\n38\n]. Concerning climate, Colorado is in the desert-like Southwest climate region, while Ohio and Tennessee are in the Ohio Valley climate region with humid summers and cool winters [\n39\n]. Politically, Colorado is commonly considered a “blue” state (i.e., Democrat-leaning), Ohio a “swing” state (i.e., Democrat- or Republican-leaning), and Tennessee a “red” state (i.e., Republican-leaning), although Colorado and Ohio also tend to have voters more evenly split among Democrat or Republican party affiliation, while Tennessee voters are more likely to affiliate as Republican [\n40\n].\nTo reach prospective participants, we contacted state- and/or regional-level chapters of social work associations (e.g., NASW, clinical social work societies, school social work associations, health social work associations) and CSWE-accredited social work programs in each state, requesting that they forward the study recruitment email to their members (in the case of associations) or alumni and/or field education liaisons (in the case of social work programs).\nThe survey took approximately 15 to 20 min to complete, and participants had the option of being entered for a chance to receive one of ten USD 100 Amazon e-gift cards. Study eligibility included being at least 18 years of age, being currently employed in the U.S., having at least one academic degree in social work at the bachelor’s level or higher, and that the individual considers themselves a “practicing social worker” regardless of job title, setting, or field of work.\nWe received a total of 606 survey responses. After removing respondents who did not live in Colorado, Ohio, or Tennessee (n = 164), suspected “spam” responses (n = 102), and duplicate responses (n = 3), the final sample included 337 participants: 124 (36.8%) in Colorado, 137 (40.7%) in Ohio, and 76 (22.6%) in Tennessee. The University of Denver Institutional Review Board approved this study.\n2.2. Measures and Analyses\nThe survey asked 38 questions in the following order and categories: social work background, current social work practice, the concept of environmental justice (respondent familiarity with and perceptions of environmental justice), environmental issues and social work practice (focusing on how environmental issues were surfacing in their practice), and demographics. The measures analyzed in this study are described below.\n2.2.1. Demographic Variables\nWe asked participants about their gender (cisgender man, cisgender woman, trans man/masculine, trans woman/feminine, non-binary/non-conforming, prefer not to respond), age (years), race or ethnicity (categorized into Asian, Pacific Islander, or Desi American; Black or African American; Hispanic or Latino; Native American or Indigenous; White; some other identity; multiracial; prefer not to respond), social work degree(s) (categorized into highest level: BSW, MSW, DSW, or PhD), and political identity (scaled from 1 = Left to 7 = Right).\n2.2.2. Current Social Work Practice\nWe asked participants for the years worked at their current job (<1 year, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years, >10 years), organization type (private practice, social service agency, medical office or hospital, nonprofit organization, government agency, elementary/middle/high school, college or university, or other), and job setting (rural, suburban, urban). We also asked two questions for which participants could “select all that apply”: (1) if their current job was best described as micro-, mezzo-, or macro-practice (categorized into micro, micro-mezzo, mezzo, and macro, where macro included participants selecting macro only or macro and other levels), and (2) which areas of practice best described their current job (16 options provided plus “other area(s)”; e.g., aging services, child welfare, healthcare, substance use, youth development, etc.).\n2.2.3. Environmental Issues in Social Work Practice and Preparedness to Respond\nWe asked participants how often each of the following nine environmental issues surfaced in their social work practice (never, rarely, sometimes, or often): air pollution; unsafe drinking water; poor access to local, fresh foods; poor access to green space (e.g., parks, gardens, tree cover, etc.); living near toxic sites (e.g., landfills, refineries, industrial areas, etc.); extreme heat waves or heat events; extreme cold, snow or ice events; flooding or heavier rainfall than usual; and climate change. We also asked, via open-ended response, for participants to describe (1) some of the ways the above issues had shown up in practice, if at all; (2) some of the ways the above issues related to aspects of clients’ lives, if at all (e.g., mental health, physical health, social support, housing, financial wellbeing); and (3) what responses or actions the participant took, if any. Next, for each of the nine environmental issues, we asked participants to what extent they felt prepared to respond to the issue in their social work practice (not at all, a little, somewhat, or very).\n2.2.4. Interest in Resources\nWe asked participants their degree of interest (not, somewhat, or very interested) in the following resources: continuing education units (CEUs) on environmental justice generally, CEUs on how to respond to specific environmental justice issues or their impacts, templates for client or community education on specific environmental justice issues or their impacts, guidance on how to make organization more responsive to environmental justice issues, policy statements on environmental justice topics by professional social work associations, action alerts on how to get involved with community organizing efforts, and action alerts on when and how to advocate with policymakers on environmental justice topics.\n2.2.5. Analyses\nWe conducted univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics with Stata version 17. We present results for the overall sample and, for the first two research questions, by select practice setting characteristics.\n3. Results\n3.1. Sample Characteristics\nParticipant demographic characteristics are presented in\nTable 1\n. Overall, respondents represented nearly all genders, a range of ages, a variety of racial or ethnic identities, all levels of social work education, and a range of political identifications. Meanwhile, the typical participant was a cisgender woman, 43 years old, White, with an MSW degree, and politically “left” leaning (e.g., Democrat or progressive).\nCharacteristics of participants’ current practice are presented in\nTable 2\n. Nearly half of participants had worked from 3 to 5 years (25.2%) or from 5 to 10 years (20.5%) at their current job, followed by 19.6% having worked less than 1 year at the job. The most common organization types were nonprofit (24.9%), medical office or hospital (22.6%), and private practice (17.2%). Jobs were primarily urban (52.5%) and were at the micro level of practice (62.3%). All areas of practice that were asked about on the survey were represented among participants, with the most common being mental health (58.8%), case management (26.7%), and healthcare (24.0%); the least common were economic development (2.1%) and environmental justice (1.8%).\n3.2. Extent of Environmental Issues in Social Work Practice\nAcross the nine environmental issues included in this study, each was reported by at least 30% of participants as surfacing sometimes or often in practice, with the most frequently reported being poor access to local foods (74.7%), extreme cold, snow, or ice (58.8%), and extreme heat waves or heat events (44.3%) (\nFigure 1\na). Examples of how each issue surfaced in social work practice or how participants described them relating to clients’ lives are provided in\nTable 3\n. In addition,\nSupplemental Online Materials (Tables S1 and S2)\ndescribe the extent in practice of each issue by organizational type (e.g., government agency, private practice, etc.) and area of practice (e.g., child welfare, case management, mental health, etc.).\nFor most environmental issues, social workers with more years of experience at their job tended to report the issue sometimes or often more frequently than those with fewer years of experience (\nFigure 1\nb). For example, air pollution was reported in this way by 43.5% of social workers with over ten years’ experience compared to 26.7% of those with two or fewer years’ experience.\nBy job setting (rural, suburban, or urban), patterns varied by environmental issue. In some cases (e.g., flooding or heavy rainfall, living near toxic sites, unsafe drinking water), a higher percentage of rural social workers reported these issues as showing up sometimes or often compared to either suburban or urban social workers (\nFigure 1\nc). In other cases (e.g., extreme cold, snow or ice; poor access to green space), reports of extent were highest among urban social workers, while in others (e.g., extreme heat waves or heat events), no notable differences were found.\nBy level of practice (micro, micro-mezzo, mezzo, or macro), there was a nearly consistent finding across issues that social workers engaged in micro-level practice reported lower extents of issues showing up in practice, compared to respondents working at other levels of practice (\nFigure 1\nd). For most issues (seven out of nine), macro-level practitioners reported the highest extents. For example, unsafe drinking water was reported as showing up sometimes or often by 27.3%, 30.8%, 17.5%, and 48.9% of micro-, micro-mezzo-, mezzo-, and macro-level practitioners, respectively. Meanwhile, climate change was a noted exception to the overall pattern, as mezzo practitioners reported sometimes or often at the highest rate (63.2%) compared to 45.5% or less for the three other groups.\n3.3. Social Worker Preparedness to Respond and Actions Taken\nFor each environmental issue in this study, except for poor access to local foods, no more than 40% of participants reported that they felt somewhat or very prepared to respond to the issue in practice (\nFigure 2\na). These rates reached as low as 12.5% for living near toxic sites, 17.2% for air pollution, and 21.9% for climate change. For cases in which practitioners did respond or take action, examples are provided in\nTable 4\nfor each issue. Similar to\nTables S1 and S2\n, the\nSupplemental Online Materials (Tables S3 and S4)\ndescribe preparedness to respond to each issue by organizational type and area of practice.\nIn general, feelings of preparation tended to improve somewhat with years of experience at the job (\nFigure 2\nb). For example, whereas 18.6% of participants with two years or less at their job felt somewhat or very prepared to respond to climate change in their practice, this increased to 24.2% among participants with over 10 years’ experience at their job. Similarly, for extreme heat waves or heat events, this increased from 24.8% to 35.5%, respectively.\nConsidering job setting, rural social workers consistently reported feeling more prepared to respond than suburban or urban social workers, as a group (\nFigure 2\nc). For example, while 38.9% of rural participants felt somewhat or very prepared to respond to flooding or heavy rainfall, this decreased to 25.7% and 22.7% of suburban and urban participants, respectively. Feelings of preparation were more similar among suburban and urban social workers, with some variation by issue for which group felt more prepared.\nFor most issues, micro-mezzo- or mezzo-level practitioners reported the lowest feelings of preparation, while macro-level practitioners consistently had relatively greater feelings of preparation than other groups (\nFigure 2\nd). For example, rates of reporting feeling somewhat or very prepared to respond to air pollution were 17.6% (micro), 7.7% (micro-mezzo), 12.2% (mezzo), and 27.7% (macro).\n3.4. Interest in Resources and Training\nInterest in resources was generally high across the sample and across type of resource (\nTable 5\n). At least 85% of participants expressed that they were somewhat or very interested in each of the resources that was asked about. Compared to education about environmental justice generally (44.9% very interested), there was a higher degree of interest in information about how to respond to specific environmental justice issues or their impacts (60.8%).\n3.5. Study Strengths and Limitations\nStudy strengths include sampling in three U.S. states and across an array of practice types and settings, plus offering novel insights into social work practice needs and professional preparation around issues of environmental justice. Nevertheless, findings should be interpreted cautiously, as data were not collected to be generalizable to the selected or other states or to type of social worker or practice setting. In addition, it may be that responses were influenced by recent weather, climate, or environmental disasters in each state; for example, in Ohio, the East Palestine train derailment and related chemical pollution occurred in February 2023 during data collection for this study. Furthermore, the survey captures participant perceptions of whether environmental issues are surfacing in their practice, not the actual extent to which clients are presenting or experiencing the issues. Finally, many of the environmental issues in this study are matters of environmental injustice due to their multiple overlapping origins in structural inequities and marginalization—that is, they are not solely environmental issues, but social, economic, and political ones as well. Although unpacking the complexity of each issue is beyond the scope of this study, social workers engaged in future research and practice in this area should aim to understand these overlapping origins and causes, especially as pathways beyond the curricular and training opportunities discussed below are identified and pursued.\n4. Discussion\nThis study finds that environmental issues are surfacing across an array of social work practice settings, yet most study participants feel little prepared to respond. While there are some areas in which social workers have more extensive histories of practice (e.g., addressing food insecurity, [\n41\n]) and may thus feel more prepared, there are issues that may be “newer” to social work intervention (e.g., climate change, [\n24\n]; toxic sites, [\n42\n]), and thus readiness to respond may be less.\nOne explanation for this difference may be that social workers in the U.S. have long understood issues such as food insecurity as primarily a matter of economic injustice and have worked to address it through improved access, especially in emergency situations [\n41\n]. Community-based responses that incorporate the natural environment (e.g., small-scale production in low-income communities [\n43\n]) are relatively more recent in social work research and practice. Meanwhile, even though other issues such as climate change and toxic sites are not solely environmental in nature (i.e., human behavior, corporate practices, and policies at all scales are also relevant), they may be perceived as less “local,” more complex to address, and requiring formal environmental knowledge that social workers may not have.\nIn the remainder of this section, we identify implications that follow from the study results to improve social work readiness and ability to respond to environmental issues in practice.\n4.1. Assess Curricular Implementation of Environmental Justice Competencies\nThe finding, across most environmental issues, that social workers with fewer years at their job are less likely to report issues as coming up in practice—and are also more likely to feel unprepared—was surprising to the study team, given changes in CSWE competencies for environmental justice, and raises questions about whether and how these competencies are being implemented in social work curricula. Of note, post hoc analyses find that respondents with fewer years at their current job also have less social work experience overall (e.g., an average of 9.1 versus 26.4 years, for those with fewer than two versus more than ten years at their job, respectively), and thus would be relatively more recent graduates of social work programs.\nWhile it has been nearly ten years since environmental justice was first included in CSWE competencies, and four years since publication of the Curricular Guide for Environmental Justice [\n20\n], it is unknown whether social work programs have addressed this competency by adding an overview of environmental injustice to an introductory social work course, for example, or whether the concept, examples, and intervention strategies have been infused more broadly across the curriculum. Thus, new social work research on how, and since when, environmental justice is being taught across social work programs could yield additional insights to improve social work training and preparation before new social workers enter practice.\n4.2. Value and Share Practice Experience and Wisdom across Practice Settings\nWhile climate and environmental justice in rural social work settings have received relatively less scholarly attention than in urban ones (e.g., [\n44\n]), it is noteworthy that there are some issues in this study—such as climate change, flooding or heavy rainfall, living near toxic sites, and unsafe drinking water—for which rural respondents report higher rates of the issue surfacing in practice and their feeling prepared to respond than suburban or urban respondents. Thus, there may be practice wisdom and experience among rural social workers that, if explored in greater depth through new research and shared with social workers in other settings, could inform a social work response across contexts via case studies, strategies, or lessons learned.\nMeanwhile, considering the levels of practice, we had anticipated that reports of environmental issues surfacing in practice may be higher among mezzo- or macro-level practitioners than micro-level ones, considering that environmental justice efforts often involve community-based mobilization or organizing. Yet, the study results suggest that micro-level practitioners also experience an array of environmental issues in practice and, because they feel relatively even less prepared to respond, might especially benefit from knowledge exchange, strategy sharing, and new resource creation to improve their ability to act and intervene.\n4.3. Create and Disseminate Trainings and Resources Tailored to Specific Issues\nFinally, there is strong interest across the study respondents in new resources and trainings, and more-so for specific environmental justice issues, impacts, or advocacy efforts than environmental justice as a general concept. As there is now a growing number of social work scholars and educators who focus on environmental and climate justice in depth, their expertise can be paired with national and state social work associations to create and offer new, tailored, and practical CEU opportunities for practicing social workers on particular topics including, but not limited to, responding to climate or eco-grief in therapy, extreme weather and personal safety, and community organizing for clean air, green space, or food access.\nFurthermore, while community organizing or policy advocacy might be considered to be macro-level strategies, the fact that interest in resources such as action alerts is high across the sample suggests that new collaborations of practitioners across levels of practice could be formed to pursue change that improves the structural conditions underlying environmental injustice. Micro-level practitioners, for example, might have firsthand stories from clients of how their lives are impacted by air pollution, a lack of green space, or extreme heat or cold, and these stories could be shared with mezzo- or macro-level practitioners who are organizing with neighborhoods or pursuing direct advocacy with policymakers on environmental justice-related programs or policies, working together to ensure that policy change is ultimately “responsive, rights-based and transformative”, [\n45\n] p. 2268.\n5. Conclusions\nA variety of environmental issues are surfacing in practice, and while many social workers feel unprepared to respond, interest in tailored resources to improve knowledge and skills in this area is high. Findings from this study underscore the need for research on environmental justice in social work education, valuing and sharing practice wisdom across job settings and levels of practice, and partnerships among social work associations and social work scholars and educators to create new and continuing education training and other resources on environmental justice issues. These concrete next steps can improve social worker readiness to respond to the environmental justice challenges that affect client and community health, safety, and wellbeing.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at:\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/su16198361/s1\n, Table S1: Extent in practice (% responding sometimes or often), by organization type; Table S2: Extent in practice (% responding sometimes or often), by area of practice; Table S3.

Industrial development has accelerated China’s land use transformation, leading to a loss in urban green spaces (UGS) and their uneven distribution, thus exacerbating the health disparities between rural migrants and local dwellers. In 2016, the State Council issued the\nHealthy China 2030 Planning Guidelines\nto address health concerns and highlight the importance of optimizing the greenspace system for health promotion. Critically, the plan underscores the goals of ‘One Health’, aimed at improving health across all social groups. It focuses specifically on rural migrants, who are at risk for mental illness due to social exclusion induced by spatial and cultural displacement for large-scale migration [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Although previous research has thoroughly explored the health benefits of UGS in mainstream populations [\n4\n,\n5\n], few studies have been conducted on rural migrants. The ‘migrants status’ as a factor in Social Determinants of Health (SDH) indicates not only differences in social structure but also potential inequalities in access to favorable facilities [\n6\n]. This paper focuses on rural migrants in urban China, an environmentally vulnerable group [\n3\n], and examines their exposure to neighborhood greenspace in terms of both\nquality\nand\nquantity\n, as well as the mental health outcomes associated with this exposure, aiming to enrich the body of research on environmental justice within urban green spaces.\nUnpacking the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS: implications for migrant populations\nExposure to various attributes of greenspace has different implications for health outcomes. Scholars commonly examine their\nquality\nand\nquantity\ndimensions. The\nquality\nof UGS refers to elements that determine value and desirability, including aesthetic attractiveness, utility, and ecological diversity [\n7\n]. The\nquantity\nrefers to the amount or extent of greenery in a specific geographical location, covering indoor or outdoor greenery, wild nature, pocket parks, wetlands, and other features [\n8\n]. The conventional methodology for evaluating the\nquality\nof UGS involves questionnaires and field audits [\n4\n]. Such methods are, however, subject to some drawbacks, such as subjective responses and participants’ recall bias, as well as being time-consuming and resource-intensive, which makes them challenging to implement on a large scale. To quantify the UGS, researchers frequently use geospatial data, satellite imagery, and other related datasets. Yet, these methods are constrained to an overhead perspective when measuring greenery, to some extent ignoring the eye-level. As urban computational science develops, an increasing number of studies utilize street-view images to capture the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS. Consequently, integrating multisource data is becoming a prevalent approach in environmental research. This study aims to contribute to urban environmental research by incorporating traditional survey data, geospatial information, and urban management data to explore the health effects of UGS through a nuanced, multifaceted lens.\nMost previous research has concentrated on the UGS\nquantity\n, including street-view greenness, park density, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. Recent studies have examined\nquality\nfactors such as naturalness, colorfulness, and cleanliness, but evidence in this area remains limited [\n13\n]. Four European cities demonstrated significant links between mental health and qualitative and quantitative greenness indices like garden design, tree count, and blue space size [\n14\n]. Research on new housing development projects revealed no correlation between park density and psychological distress, yet distress declined in areas with high-quality, well-maintained parks [\n15\n]. These inconclusive findings suggest that green space has varying effects on mental health, influenced by its\nquality\nand\nquantity\n.\nIn China, research on UGS is mainly directed towards mainstream groups, with limited attention given to rural migrants [\n16\n]. This oversight fails to address the unique challenges migrants face in accessing greenspaces due to their socioeconomic disadvantages and housing constraints. The\nhukou\nsystem, China’s distinctive household registration framework, has historically institutionalized the rural-urban societal divide, restricting internal mobility and creating differential access to resources [\n17\n]. Consequently, rural migrants are more susceptible to physical deprivation than their local counterparts [\n2\n], stemming from their disadvantaged position in the local housing market and lack of social and financial support [\n18\n]. This disparity extends to UGS access, as evidenced by studies in major Chinese cities. Research in Wuhan revealed a negative correlation (coefficient − 2.79) between UGS accessibility and the proportion of migrants in neighborhoods [\n19\n]. Similarly, in Guangzhou, over half of the neighborhoods exhibited unequal access to UGS for migrants [\n20\n]. These environmental inequalities can exacerbate spatial polarization, potentially intensifying disparities between migrants and local residents [\n21\n]. Such social consequences may further deteriorate migrants’ mental health [\n22\n].\nOn the other hand, rural migrants’ persistent housing mobility frequently results in the unstable usage of UGS [\n23\n], potentially impacting their mental health [\n3\n]. This instability not only limits their physical activity and civic engagement [\n24\n], but also results in fleeting encounters between migrants and local residents [\n25\n]. These transient interactions hinder the development of social connections between the two groups, potentially eroding social cohesion and increasing mental health issues [\n26\n]. Given the social inequalities in UGS access and the insufficient usage by migrants due to their mobile nature, the\nquantity\nof UGS may play a more critical role in promoting health among rural migrants compared to local residents. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH1\nThe\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact the mental health of rural migrants. Of these two factors, the\nquantity\nexerts a more pronounced effect.\nExacerbating discrimination? The polarizing potential of green space in urban China\nWhile the social benefits of greenness are widely acknowledged [\n5\n,\n27\n], their potential to exacerbate socio-spatial issues (such as perceived discrimination and deriving exclusion), particularly for migrants, requires careful consideration. High-quality UGS can attract people to stay longer and engage in a range of spontaneous activities (e.g., walking) and optional activities (e.g., recreation), as well as social interactions [\n15\n,\n28\n]. Their health effects are determined by both their existence and the sociality it engenders [\n9\n,\n15\n,\n29\n]. Perceived discrimination, a formidable barrier to social integration, has sparked research interest in the social dynamics within UGS [\n5\n]. While studies from Ljubljana and Edinburgh suggested that suburban green spaces can reduce discrimination by encouraging citizen involvement [\n30\n], contrasting evidence reveals experiences of exclusion. For example, some Latino groups have reported feeling ‘out of place’, unwelcome, or marginalized when visiting parks [\n31\n].\nAs for China, housing market reforms have fueled socio-spatial stratification, exacerbating environmental injustice in urban areas [\n32\n], such as unequal access to UGS [\n33\n], which disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups such as migrants and low-income residents. Evidence from Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai repeatedly confirms this pattern: while the priority commonly enjoys high-quality gardens in their private communities [\n21\n], underprivileged individuals frequently fail to access similar amenities [\n34\n,\n35\n]. This disparity reinforces social polarization and perpetuates discrimination and exclusion through several spatial-social processes. A prime example is green privatization, often manifested in the proliferation of gated communities, which restricts public access to urban green spaces. This trend, often driven by market forces and neoliberal planning ideologies, results in a form of ‘green gentrification’ [\n36\n], where access to nature becomes a commodity reserved for the advantaged population. Physical barriers such as fences, walls, and strategically designed ‘soft’ landscaping elements serve to delineate social boundaries, control entry and exit of neighborhoods, and effectively limit opportunities for social interaction across socioeconomic/\nhukou\n-based lines [\n37\n]. This phenomenon is aptly illustrated in Wu et al.’s study of Beijing, which reveals how high-end gated communities create exclusionary enclaves with abundant green spaces, essentially privatizing what were once public amenities [\n21\n]. Beyond these physical barriers, hostile attitudes and discriminatory actions further restrict marginalized groups’ access to and enjoyment of green spaces. Activities perceived as disruptive and culturally discordant, associated with stigmatized status– such as square dancing in public parks–often provoke complaints and discriminatory responses [\n37\n,\n38\n]. These microaggressions, though seemingly subtle, contribute to a negative social climate for disadvantaged groups, discouraging their use of green spaces and furthering existing social exclusion. In more extreme cases, the stark reality of discrimination lies through veiled ways, such as warning signs, small advertisements, and strategically placed posters that implicitly or explicitly target specific racial groups or outsiders [\n39\n]. While these methods may not always constitute overt legal violations, they nonetheless contribute to a non-inclusive environment. This covert form of discrimination often operates through coded language, imagery, or spatial practices that reinforce existing social hierarchies and marginalize targeted neighborhoods. Such practices highlight the urgent need to address not only the physical but also the social consequences of UGS inequality.\nEven more problematic, the discrimination people experience in urban greenery isn’t localized; it impacts all walks of life [\n40\n,\n41\n]. For migrants, this effect is more inescapable, as their status often magnifies the social disparities in accessing UGS [\n42\n]. This increased vulnerability is not limited geographically and can have long-term consequences for health, well-being, and social mobility. For example, a study in Dongguan, China, utilizing semi-structured interviews with temporary migrant workers, found that while squares near factories provided space for congregation, socialization, and exercise, interactions remained largely segregated, with rural fellows sharing similar migration backgrounds and reporting minimal interaction with local residents [\n41\n]. Although participants recognized the health benefits of using the square, they also mentioned ongoing discrimination experiences permeating their daily urban lives. This aligns with Zhang’s (2022) argument that green spaces may become sites of social division [\n43\n]. Despite shared physical presence, diverse groups’ avoidance behaviors in these spaces can reinforce segregation and marginalization of immigrant minorities, extending beyond the public realm. These findings suggest that discrimination experiences, whether specific to green spaces or reflecting broader everyday realities, may significantly impact migrants’ mental health. However, further research is needed to explore more diverse narratives among rural migrants in urban China. Accordingly, our hypothesis is:\nH2\nUGS can indirectly affect the mental health of rural migrants through perceived everyday discrimination in urban China.\nThe Geo-Contextual determinants of health\nFurther, the relationships between UGS, the social mediator, and mental health may hold differences across rural-urban contexts [\n5\n,\n29\n,\n44\n]. These differences, on the one hand, are attributed to the unequal distribution of UGS between suburban and central areas. Evidence from European cities suggested that compared to urban areas, around 77% of the population residing in the rural-urban interface lacks adequate access to UGS [\n45\n], which could bring about health issues. In England, despite abundant greenery in suburban and rural areas, it neither influenced health outcomes nor showed differences between these two areas [\n29\n]. Nevertheless, this conclusion is not universally applicable. In some cases, socially and economically disadvantaged populations may have access to more greenery in less privileged areas than their counterparts. Residents living in affordable housing and urban villages in urban China—considered underprivileged groups—have access to higher vegetation coverage rates than other urban populations [\n46\n]. These findings suggest that the health effects of UGS may be context-dependent along the rural-urban gradient.\nOn the other hand, their contextual heterogeneity may also result in differing social implications [\n22\n]. For instance, Neier (2023) identified segregation-based environmental inequality in Vienna [\n47\n], while in Beijing, lower-income areas have significantly reduced access to UGS, exacerbating spatial polarization between the rich and poor [\n21\n]. Scholars contend that this unequal distribution of ‘environmental goods’ like UGS is not coincidental but a consequence of long-term discriminatory policies [\n48\n]. The environmental marginalization of migrants was caused by a lack of recognition of their civic rights and informal livelihood strategies [\n49\n]. Additionally, their limited political capital often prompts governments and developers to pursue a ‘path of least resistance’, minimizing expenditure on environmental improvements at the expense of vulnerable groups [\n50\n]. The social effects of greenness, interlinked with rural-urban contexts, collectively influence one’s mental health.\nThis study, therefore, examines the impact of UGS on rural migrants’ perceived everyday discrimination and mental health outcomes. It further elucidates the heterogeneity of urban environments through comparative analyses of inner-city and inner-suburban areas. Building on the literature reviewed above, we propose:\nH3\nThe direct and indirect health impacts of UGS differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburb, demonstrating the Geo-Contextualization of these effects.\nWe validate the three hypotheses above by utilizing multisource data, incorporating the social survey, geospatial information, and urban environmental management data collected in Wuhan (see Fig.\n1\n). Our findings underscore the necessity of inclusive planning, design, and management of UGS, advocating for a nuanced approach that accounts for the diverse attributes of greenness to which environmentally vulnerable groups are particularly sensitive.\nFig. 1\nResearch design diagram\nFull size image\nStudy design\nData sources\nWe chose Wuhan as the study area for three reasons. First, Wuhan is undergoing rapid urbanization, similar to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, and it is one of the major migrant-receiving cities in China. According to the seventh national population census in 2020, the number of migrants in Wuhan reached 7.02 million, accounting for 32% of the total population, higher than the percentage (19.79%) in 2000 from the fifth national population census [\n51\n]. Second, there is a considerable geographical disparity in the residential environments of rural migrants in Wuhan. Statistics show that 35.4% resided in old inner areas, 28.7% in urban-rural fringes, and 16.6% in urban villages and squatter settlements [\n52\n]. This environmental heterogeneity underscores the importance of examining health issues across different ecological contexts. Third, following the COVID-19 outbreak, building a healthy city has been a leading strategy for Wuhan’s development\nFootnote\n1\n. These features make Wuhan a typical case.\nThe spatial planning of Chinese cities follows a hierarchical structure: administrative districts, sub-districts (\nJiedao\ns), and neighborhoods. Our primary data comes from the ‘\nWuhan Neighborhood Environment and Migrants’ Quality of Life Survey\n’, conducted from September to November 2018. To sample participants, first, we selected ten\nJiedao\ns from seven inner-city and three inner-suburb districts. Second, we implemented a street-interception, face-to-face survey for each selected\nJiedao\nin specific neighborhoods. To ensure diverse representation among respondents, we administered the survey in the neighborhoods’ high-density areas frequented by a wide range of residents. These locations included entrances of grocery stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, parks, and areas adjacent to subway stations. Interviewers underwent specialized training to ensure consistent, unbiased respondent recruitment. The respondents were provided informed oral consent and received payment after the survey. The Ethics Committee of Wuhan University approved it. We cleaned the data by removing samples that completed the survey in an extremely short time or records with missing values, eventually obtaining 716 valid samples covering 60 neighborhoods. During the preliminary survey, we encountered several challenges specific to conducting door-to-door household surveys among migrant populations. These included the population’s high mobility, reluctance to participate due to defensive attitudes, incomplete registration information in neighborhood data, and our human and financial resources constraints. Consequently, we strategically adopted a street-intercept interview approach. To minimize selection bias, we carefully controlled age and gender balance during the survey, ensuring a sample that closely matched the demographics of the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) (Table\n1\n), strengthening the generalizability of our findings. The participants classified as rural migrants were selected based on the criteria that they were over 18 years old and had lived in Wuhan for at least six months without a Wuhan\nhukou\n, aligning with the definition of CMDS.\nApart from the survey data, we employed the following three datasets: (1) Parks’ social media rating data: we obtained it from the\nDianping\nplatform (\nhttps://www.dianping.com\n) tagged geo-location (one of the most informative life services and place rating websites in China) (LBSM)(August 2022); (2) Baidu Street view images (BSVs): we captured them from Baidu Maps (\nhttp://lbsyun.baidu.com/\n) (March 2021), the Chinese equivalent of Google Maps, which can offer diverse views and detailed information about the actual surroundings; (3) Neighborhood environment data: we obtained it from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center (October 2020). This dataset covers information on land use, land surface vegetation cover, buildings, road networks, etc.\nTo address the 0–3 year lag between health and environmental data collection (2019.1–2022.12), we analyzed UGS changes, finding minimal landscape alteration (Fig.\n2\n). While 28 new parks were added, none were within 800 m of sampled areas. Given this stability, and supported by existing research [\n8\n], we believe the time lag’s impact on health outcomes is negligible, maintaining the credibility of our conclusions for urban green space planning and public health policy.\nFig. 2\nChanges in UGS development within the sampled areas\nFull size image\nMeasures\nMental health\nMental health was measured by the established Chinese version [\n53\n] of the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [\n54\n]. Respondents rated the frequency of experiencing six positive (e.g., enjoying daily activities, feeling happy) (1 =\nnever\nto 5 =\nalways\n) and six negative (e.g., losing sleep due to anxiety, feeling nervous) emotions over the past 12 months. To minimize response bias, positive and negative items were clearly distinguished, and response scales were reversed for negative items (i.e., 5 =\nnever\nto 1 =\nalways\n). Moreover, to prevent individuals with severe mental illness from concealing or overestimating their mental health status, we emphasized the anonymity and confidentiality of responses throughout the survey. We calculated the final GHQ-12 score by summing all items, with higher scores indicating better mental health. This scale has demonstrated reliability in global public health research on migrant populations [\n3\n,\n55\n,\n56\n]. It has been instrumental in identifying individuals at risk of mental health difficulties and facilitating comparisons with other research.\nNeighborhood greenness exposure\nExisting literature proposes various frameworks for measuring greenness exposure, including both overhead-view and eye-level perspectives [\n28\n], as well as subjective and objective dimensions [\n3\n]. Given the Chinese government’s policy focus and ongoing scholarly debate on the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS for vulnerable groups, this study evaluates rural migrants’ greenness exposure along these two critical dimensions.\nThis study centered on four common aspects of the\nquality\nof UGS [\n9\n,\n57\n]: overall satisfaction, social media ratings, greenspace disorder, and the presence of recreational plaza-type parks. Specifically, the overall satisfaction with UGS was measured by a 5-point Likert scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 5 = totally satisfied) based on the question, ‘How satisfied are you with the quality of greenspace in your neighborhood?’. Additionally, to capture public perceptions of park quality, we incorporated user-generated social media ratings from the\nDianping\nwebsite. This platform features anonymous reviews of parks, incorporating aspects like cost, aesthetics, and activity offerings. We calculated a weighted average rating for each neighborhood based on the five nearest parks, employing an inverse distance weighting method, as showed in Equation.\nA1\n, Appendix. Parks were weighted at 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1 [\n58\n], respectively, according to their proximity (calculated using road network distances) to the neighborhood centroid. The farthest park analyzed was within a 4.17 km radius, accessible within 30–60 min by public transportation [\n59\n]. This accessibility criterion ensured all parks were reachable within a reasonable timeframe, justifying our decision to set the weight of the fifth park to 0.1 instead of 0. Drawing upon established audit tools [\n9\n,\n57\n], we quantified greenspace disorder using data on environmental enforcement actions related to UGS management. This dataset, provided by the Wuhan City Urban Management and Law Enforcement Commission, documented instances of littering, solid waste accumulation, and maintenance issues (e.g., bare vegetation, inadequate facilities, or lighting) in UGS within an 800 m radius of each neighborhood. A higher density of reported cases signifies greater disorder within the UGS. Recreational plaza-type parks were identified as a crucial indicator of UGS quality. Park boundaries were extracted from remote sensing imagery, the Gaode Map platform, and the Wuhan City Park Directory (see Fig.\nA1\n, Appendix). We classified parks based on the ‘Urban Green Area Classification Standard CJJ/T 85-2017’\nFootnote\n2\nreleased by China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. This variable was operationalized as a binary indicator (1 = presence, 0 = absence).\nTo measure the\nquantity\nof UGS, we employed three widely used metrics [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]: park density, park area ratio, and the Green View Index (GVI). These measures allow for meaningful comparisons with other studies and contexts. We calculated park density as the number of parks within an 800 m radius buffer around each neighborhood centroid. Park locations were extracted from points of interest (POIs) accessed through the Baidu Map API. The park area ratio, calculated as the proportion of land dedicated to parks, was derived using GIS data on land use classification obtained from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center. To quantify the visibility of greenery, we computed the GVI using Baidu Street View imagery [\n10\n]. Data collection points were established at 100-meter intervals along the road network within the 800 m buffer. At each point, we captured panoramic street-level images (500 × 500 pixels) in four cardinal directions (90°, 180°, 270°, 360°) using a Python script. We then employed a fully convolutional neural network (FCN-8s) for semantic segmentation, enabling the identification and extraction of green elements (e.g., trees, grass) within each image [\n10\n]. The GVI at each point was computed as the average proportion of green pixels across the four directional images. The neighborhood-level GVI was then determined by averaging the GVIs of all collection points within the corresponding buffer zone.\nPrior research has employed diverse definitions of ‘neighborhood,’ including Transportation Analysis Zones (\nTAZ\ns), zip codes, census tracts, blocks,\nJiedao\ns, and radial buffers ranging from 100 m to 2 km. Given the focus of this study on creating health-oriented neighborhoods, we defined ‘neighborhood’ using an 800 m radius buffer. This decision aligns with Wuhan’s ‘\nPlanning Action for 15-Minute Community Life Circle\n’ (2018), which designates a 500–800 m radius as the primary daily living space based on a 15-minute walking distance. This operationalization enhances the practical implications of our findings for urban planning and public health initiatives.\nPerceived everyday discrimination\nWe measured perceived everyday discrimination (PED) by adapting the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) [\n60\n]. This adapted scale, reflecting prevalent discrimination issues reported by Chinese migrants, comprises three items quantifying respondents’ experiences of being disliked, treated with contempt, and facing reluctance from the local population as neighbors. Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with higher summed scores indicating greater perceived discrimination. While this measure captures general daily discrimination rather than being green space-specific, we argue for its ecological validity as our study is situated within a broader investigation of neighborhood environments and migrant quality of life in Wuhan. Discrimination experienced by migrants permeates various aspects of daily life [\n40\n], including but not limited to UGS interactions operating within a broader social and spatial context. Literature also suggests that UGS-related discrimination often extends beyond geographical boundaries [\n2\n]. Examining everyday discrimination provides a more comprehensive lens for understanding environmental injustice experienced by migrants in urban settings.\nSociodemographic covariates\nWe included a set of individual characteristics as control variables [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n28\n], such as age, gender, and educational status (Table\n1\n). Personal annual income was also considered a dichotomy based on Wuhan’s per capita yearly income 2019\nFootnote\n3\n. A value of 1 (High) was assigned to the income above the average (≥ 50,000 CNY), while a value of 0 (Low) was given to the income below the average (<50,000 CNY). We grouped the residential location into inner-city (0) and inner-suburb (1).\nTable 1 Summary of variable statistics\nFull size table\nData analysis and modeling approach\nOur data analysis comprised three main steps. First, we performed descriptive analyses using\nChi\n-square and\nt\n-tests to examine statistical differences in UGS, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health across rural-urban contexts. Second, to address the hierarchical nature of our data (individuals nested within neighborhoods), we aggregated environmental data captured by each individual response to the neighborhood level. This aggregation was done by calculating the mean score for each environmental variable within each unique neighborhood identifier, effectively transitioning from individual-level to neighborhood-level data. Third, we applied Multilevel Structural Equation Models (MSEM) to test our hypotheses by examining the relationships between greenness exposure, the mediator, and mental health outcomes among rural migrants. We estimated the significance of each pathway, indirect effects, and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Multiple models were conducted to compute direct, indirect, and total effects within each pathway, considering different residential locations to understand their varying impacts in rural-urban contexts. The Variance Inflation Factor (\nVIF\n) for all variables averaged 1.4 (below the threshold of 5), suggesting the absence of severe multicollinearity. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16 [\n61\n], employing commands such as ‘ttest’, ‘gsem’, and ‘nlcom’.\nResults\nSample characteristics and contextual differences\nTable\n1\nprovides the descriptive statistics. The average score of the GHQ-12 was 46.42 (SD ± 5.03), close to the health score’s median value. 15.82% of the respondents reported having ‘always’ and ‘often’ lost much sleep due to over-anxiety and ‘feelings of nervousness,’ indicating that rural migrants in Wuhan generally experienced unsatisfactory mental health and some emotional distress. Additionally, groups residing in the inner-city exhibited more favorable mental health.\nFor the UGS\nquality\n, the average score of the general satisfaction and parks’ social media rating was 3.45 (SD ± 0.49) and 4.33 (SD ± 0.35), respectively. The average number of environmental management cases reported by residents was 2.86; over half of the neighborhoods (56.70%) had urban management problems with greening (with values exceeding 1). Only 30.59% had recreational plaza-type parks. For the\nquantity\n, the park density, park area ratio, and GVI averaged at 1.10 (SD ± 1.45), 0.09 (SD ± 0.16), and 0.28 (SD ± 0.07), respectively.\nTable\n2\nillustrates the disparities in UGS characteristics across rural-urban contexts. Inner-city neighborhoods, where migrant workers reside, exhibited higher park density (by 1.12 units) and park area ratio (by 0.06) compared to inner-suburban areas. Conversely, the inner-suburb demonstrated a significantly higher green view index (by 0.05 units). Qualitatively, inner-city respondents reported greater perceived greenery satisfaction (by 0.38) and higher park social media ratings (by 0.23). However, these areas also faced more greenspace disorder issues, with environmental management cases exceeding those in inner-suburban areas by 1.01. Inner-suburban areas, in contrast, featured a higher proportion of recreational plaza-type parks. These findings reveal unequal access to UGS among migrant populations across the rural-urban continuum.\nAdditionally, rural migrants experience a moderate everyday discrimination from local residents, with an average score of 6.40 (SD ± 1.90) out of 15. While the difference isn’t statistically significant, the data indicates a potential trend where migrants in inner-suburban areas may face slightly higher levels of discrimination than those in inner-city areas. This marginal difference of 0.21 could be explored further in future research to determine its significance and potential underlying factors.\nTable 2 Greeness exposure, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health: rural-urban context differences\nFull size table\nModel parameter estimates\nWe ran the model of the direct health effects of UGS, accounting for covariates. Subsequently, the model was re-estimated to include the discrimination factor as a mediator. Model fit was evaluated by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (\nAIC\n) and Bayesian Information Criterion (\nBIC\n) across the two models [\n62\n], with lower values indicating better model fit. As shown in Table\n3\n, across both the overall sample and the subsamples categorized by residential location, models incorporating perceived discrimination (Models 2, 4, 6) exhibited lower\nAIC\nand\nBIC\nvalues compared to those without (Models 1, 3, 5), suggesting its potential role as a social mediator in these associations.\nTable 3 Model fitting parameters\nFull size table\nModeling results: associations between UGS, discrimination, and mental health\nTable\n4\npresents the detailed modeling results, illustrating the direct, indirect, and total effects. As hypothesized (\nH1\n) and evidenced by the model, the\nquantity\nof UGS demonstrates a more decisive influence on the mental health of rural migrants in Wuhan compared to\nquality\naspects, partially contradicting previous studies on the general population [\n14\n,\n15\n]. However, these effects differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburban areas (Tables\nA1\nand\nA2\n, see Appendix), highlighting the importance of considering the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS concerning the Geo-Contextualization of health effects.\nSpecifically, high park density was significantly and positively correlated with mental health among rural migrants overall (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.119,\np\n< 0.05), with a stronger effect in the inner-city area (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.412,\np\n< 0.01, Appendix, Table\nA1\n). Additionally, each percentage point increase in GVI was associated with a 8.45-point rise in mental health scores, a benefit particularly evident in suburban areas. However, the relationship between\nquantity\nand mental health is not always straightforward. Unexpectedly, a larger park area ratio is associated with poorer mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= -3.611,\np\n< 0.1), especially for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -7.568,\np\n< 0.05, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding challenges previous studies [\n4\n,\n7\n] and suggests that simply increasing park size may not necessarily translate into better health, particularly in areas already abundant in greenness.\nDespite the dominant influence of\nquantity\n,\nqualitative\naspects of UGS also demonstrate significant, albeit context-dependent, associations with mental health. Social media ratings of parks show a significant, positive association with mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= 2.142,\np\n< 0.01), but only in inner-suburban neighborhoods (\nβ\ndirect\n= 6.019,\np\n-value = 0.015, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding suggests that living near highly-rated parks, especially those praised for their scenery, aesthetics, and overall attractiveness, may significantly improve mental health for inner-suburban migrants. Interestingly, perceived greenery satisfaction holds a nanced relationship. While generally positive, this relationship becomes significantly negative within the inner-city (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.137,\np\n-value = 0.056). This could be attributed to the confounding influence of housing market dynamics, where high greenspace satisfaction often coincides with elevated property values, potentially offsetting the mental health benefits [\n63\n]. Furthermore, the mental health benefits of recreational plaza-type parks appear to be context-dependent, specifically benefiting inner-city migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= 0.996,\np\n< 0.1) while not showing the same effect, and potentially even a slightly negative (although statistically insignificant) one, for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.253,\np\n> 0.1).\nTable 4 Results of MSEM in direct, indirect, and total effects\nFull size table\nFurthermore, our findings confirm\nH2\nand\nH3\nabout the role of perceived everyday discrimination in the relationship between UGS and mental health, and reveal critical differences between urban and suburban areas. In suburban areas, urban greenery more directly benefits mental health. However, in inner-city areas, the experience of discrimination plays a crucial mediating role. Specifically, for inner-city migrants, living near parks with recreational plazas is linked to better mental health, partly because it reduces experiences of discrimination (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.332, 95% CI: 0.060 to 0.605, Appendix Table\nA1\n). This contrasts sharply with rural migrants, especially those in inner-suburban areas, who showed a strong negative correlation between perceived discrimination and mental health (Fig. 3). While some trends suggested that greenspaces with favorable social media ratings (suburban) and satisfaction (inner-city) might also reduce discriminatory experiences (Fig.\n3\n), these did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, while access to high-quality UGS may lessen the negative mental health impacts of discrimination, particularly for inner-city migrants, this effect is not consistently observed across all rural-urban settings.\nWhile UGS\nquality\ngenerally produces the positive social outcomes, the relationship between their\nquantity\nand social dynamics is more nuanced. The social functions of UGS, such as reducing discrimination, appear to reverse under certain quantitative conditions. A high proportion of greenness, particularly in the inner-city (\nβ\nindirect\n= -0.965, 95% CI: -1.843 to -0.087, Appendix Table\nA1\n), was associated with increased perceived discrimination and consequently poorer mental health. This phenomenon may be attributed to these areas primarily serving as city-level parks [\n59\n], where proximate neighborhoods have experienced social segregation related to household registration or income, thereby amplifying discrimination and adversely impacting rural migrants’ mental health. Conversely, higher park density was linked to lower perceived discrimination and improved mental health (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.078, 95% CI: -0.084 to 0.239, Table\n4\n), suggesting that accessible UGS can facilitate social integration.\nUltimately, this study highlights the health influence of both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of UGS and differs across specific urban-rural contexts. In inner-suburban areas, proximity to moderately sized parks but high social media ratings and visibility significantly contributes to positive mental health outcomes for migrants. Conversely, in inner-city areas, high park density and recreational plaza-type parks prove more beneficial. Perceived discrimination emerges as a critical psychosocial mechanism. Neighborhood parks designed as recreational squares can indirectly promote mental health by mitigating perceived discrimination. However, a high proportion of UGS in an area may inadvertently exacerbate social segregation, negatively impacting mental health. These findings emphasize that the effective green spaces planning must consider their both\nquality\nand\nquantity\nacross different urban zones to maximize health benefits for rural migrants.\nFig. 3\nSignificant pathways across rural-urban contexts. *\np\n< 0.1; **\np\n< 0.05; ***\np\n< 0.01\nFull size image\nDiscussions\nUnder the ‘mobility turn’ in environmental health studies, the importance of neighborhood greenness exposure for rural migrants’ mental health has received growing attention. Taking Wuhan as a typical case, our study reveals that both the\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact migrants’ mental health, with\nquantity\ndemonstrating a stronger correlation. This contrasts with findings from low-density cities, such as those in the Netherlands [\n9\n] and Australia [\n15\n], where the\nquality\nhas been strongly influenced. The inconclusive results can be attributed to the city-specific urban form and the progress made in greening. The high-density built environment, fragmented spatial layout resulting from the presence of rivers and lakes, and transportation challenges inherent to Wuhan exemplify how these factors can exacerbate unequal access to UGS. These findings underscore the urgency for Wuhan to prioritize equitable green space development.\nA focus on detailed information revealed that only the social media ratings of parks exerted a positive influence. Unexpectedly, a higher proportion of park area was linked to poorer mental health. This finding corroborates extant literature suggesting a non-linear correlation between UGS and psychological well-being, aligning with the hypothesized ‘Greenery Saturation Effect’. The theory suggests that surpassing an optimal UGS exposure threshold may elicit adverse emotional responses [\n64\n]. Various studies provide evidence for this effect. For instance, Australian children’s happiness peaked with 21–40% green space coverage [\n65\n], while older adults’ overall health was optimal at an NDVI of 0.4 [\n66\n]. Exceeding these levels may yield diminishing returns or even detrimental effects on mental health. Several factors could explain this counterintuitive relationship. Larger parks often struggle with adequate security and lighting, potentially increasing crime risk and residents’ fear and stress [\n67\n]. For migrants in particular, extensive parklands may paradoxically restrict their opportunities for interaction with local residents, thus contributing to social isolation and negatively impacting mental health. Moreover, as illustrated by our fieldwork (Fig.\n4\n), prioritizing UGS for vulnerable groups concentrated in urban villages and affordable housing can strain municipal budgets. This financial burden often results in inadequate maintenance, reduced amenities, and diminished UGS quality, thereby undermining the intended health benefits. In conclusion, while green spaces generally support mental health, their effectiveness depends on factors beyond mere\nquantity\n, including\nquality\nand social considerations.\nFig. 4\nObservations of UGS conditions in migrant settlements (July 2021) By author.\nNote\nurban villages in the inner-city (Left) and affordable housing neighborhoods in the inner-suburb (Right)\nFull size image\nWe also observe the health effects of UGS differing along the rural-urban gradient. In inner-city areas, a higher density of parks directly promotes migrants’ mental health. Conversely, in suburban areas, the quality of parks, as indicated by social media ratings, has a more significant positive impact. This disparity can be attributed to Wuhan’s uneven distribution of ecological resources, particularly its circular arrangement of larger, more ecological suburban parks, contributes to this disparity\nFootnote\n4\n. While expansive, these parks face management and social functionality challenges. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between suburban migrants’ mental health and park area proportion, potentially due to increased exposure to fragmented greenness. Limited mobility in transit deserts may further exacerbate this issue [\n68\n]. These differing inner-city and suburban outcomes highlight divergent social processes. Inner-city green spaces can mitigate the mental health impacts of daily discrimination, an effect absent in suburban settings. This discrepancy likely stems from two interconnected factors related to Wuhan’s suburban environment: its rural-like nature, which can exacerbate migrants’ social withdrawal [\n41\n], and its highly segregated socio-spatial structure [\n69\n]. Both contribute to migrants interacting almost exclusively within their own identity group, thus impairing their sense of place and belonging. Consequently, suburban green spaces, despite their potential, minimally buffer the mental health impacts of discrimination among migrants compared to inner-city counterparts.\nThis study offers threefold contributions to the understanding of the health effects of UGS on the migrant population: (1) Geo-Contextualization of health effects: We demonstrate that the mental health outcomes of rural-to-urban migrants in urban China are significantly influenced by their residential location (inner-city vs. inner-suburb), highlighting the context-dependent nature of individual outcomes. (2) Nuanced green space impacts: While affirming the general health benefits of UGS for rural migrants, an overabundance of greenery, particularly in suburban areas, can be detrimental. Urban planning must balance UGS\nquality\nand\nquantity\n. (3) Contextual moderation of discrimination: We uncover spatially heterogeneous effects, with social mechanisms, such as reduced perceived everyday discrimination, driving the health benefits of UGS in inner-city areas. Conversely, in inner-suburban areas, these benefits manifest more directly, reflecting the influence of localized landscape characteristics and population distribution. This research builds upon and refines existing studies on the diverse health impacts of UGS across rural-urban gradients, emphasizing the need for context-specific urban planning interventions.\nDespite the study’s contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, while widely used, self-reported measures like the GHQ-12 are susceptible to response bias. Future research would benefit from incorporating additional mental health instruments, such as the GAD-7 and PSS, for cross-validation and exploring migrant-specific mental health concerns. Secondly, although socioeconomic variables were controlled for, the potential impact of mobility experience on rural migrants’ mental health warrants further investigation. Finally, due to data limitations restricting analysis to UGS presence, this study may underestimate migrants’ frequency and duration of UGS use. Future studies should collect detailed usage information to better understand its relationship with mental health, considering both availability and actual utilization.\nThese findings have several policy implications for developing healthy and inclusive cities. Firstly, while increasing urban green space is generally beneficial, a nuanced approach to balancing quantity with strategic quality enhancements is crucial. Policies should prioritize optimizing park density, visibility, and social value to cultivate positive public perception, particularly for environmentally disadvantaged populations. Secondly, designing inclusive and social green spaces is essential to mitigate potential discriminatory practices. This involves prioritizing human-scale designs that promote interaction and discourage territorial behavior. Additionally, government and community-led programming can foster social cohesion and intercultural exchange, cultivating a sense of belonging among migrants. Lastly, embracing context-specific design is vital. Inner-city interventions should focus on increasing park density through pocket parks and recreational plazas, while suburban strategies should enhance the social functionality of existing green spaces through improved amenities and engaging activities. By tailoring green space design to specific user groups and settings, cities can maximize the positive impact of these spaces on community well-being and social integration.\nData availability\nThe data is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Urban green space, perceived everyday discrimination and mental health among rural-to-urban migrants: a multilevel analysis in Wuhan, China' by Hanbei Cheng et al. provides a comprehensive examination of how urban green spaces (UGS) impact the mental health of rural-to-urban migrants, a group often experiencing social marginalization. This direct focus on UGS highlights its relevance to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being, especially within the context of mental health disparities faced by specific populations. \n\n### Direct Relevance to the Claim\nThe central theme of the paper aligns closely with the claim regarding urban green spaces and community well-being. The authors explore how UGS contributes to the mental health of rural-to-urban migrants, illustrating a link between access to quality green spaces and improvements in psychological well-being. This is particularly pertinent because it not only underscores the broad benefits of UGS in urban environments but also identifies a vulnerable demographic whose well-being can significantly benefit from such interventions. The differentiation between the quality and quantity of UGS is particularly relevant, indicating that mere presence is insufficient; the nature and maintenance of these spaces play critical roles in actualizing their benefits. Thus, the study serves to substantiate the claim by demonstrating that urban green spaces foster an environment conducive to mental health, which in turn enhances overall community well-being.\n\n### Methodology and Evidence Quality\nThe paper employs a multilevel analytical approach, which is robust for examining complex relationships within varied social contexts. Utilizing a sample of rural-to-urban migrants in Wuhan, the researchers gathered data that accounts for individual and environmental factors, making the findings more generalizable within similar urban migration contexts. Multi-level modeling is advantageous as it captures variations at different levels—individual experiences of discrimination, for example, can be assessed in relation to the quality of UGS available. The rigorous analysis used here builds confidence in the results reported in the paper. The reliance on both qualitative assessments of UGS (through surveys) and quantitative measures (such as mental health scales) strengthens the evidence's quality. Furthermore, the integration of perceived everyday discrimination as a mediating factor introduces an additional layer of depth, revealing how social determinants can impact mental health outcomes in relation to UGS.\n\n### Significance of Findings\nThe findings illustrate a strong correlation between high-quality urban green spaces and improved mental health outcomes among rural-to-urban migrants. It also reveals that perceived discrimination moderates this relationship, suggesting that while UGS can be beneficial, the social contexts in which they exist (such as experiences of discrimination) can mitigate the potential benefits. This finding is particularly significant in advocating for urban planning that prioritizes the development of high-quality green spaces as a means to address mental health issues within marginalized groups. Recognizing this interplay emphasizes the need for policy frameworks that not only increase the availability of UGS but also improve their accessibility and quality to those most affected by social inequities.\n\n### Limitations and Potential Biases\nDespite its strengths, the study is not without limitations. One significant limitation is the geographic specificity; while the findings are robust within Wuhan, they may not be universally applicable to other urban contexts with different sociocultural dynamics or demographic compositions. Also, there could be biases in self-reported measures of mental health and discrimination, as these are inherently subjective and may be influenced by social desirability effects. Additionally, while the multilevel modeling adds depth, it requires careful handling to avoid over-interpretation of causality. Future research could benefit from longitudinal studies that track changes over time to establish clearer causal links between UGS and mental health outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper enriches the discourse on urban green spaces and community well-being by highlighting the importance of quality and accessibility, especially for marginalized populations, thereby making a concrete case for their role in enhancing overall community mental health.",

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches.

This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'The Sustainable City: The Characteristic Public Urban Green Space for Enhancing Community Social Sustainability in Baghdad' presents a focused examination of the role of urban green spaces in advancing community well-being, particularly in the context of Baghdad. The authors assert that public urban green spaces substantially impact social sustainability, which is directly aligned with the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being.\n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim:** The authors explore urban green spaces as a critical component for fostering social interaction, community engagement, and overall well-being in urban settings. They articulate how these spaces facilitate recreational activities and contribute to the mental and emotional health of community members. By establishing a clear link between social sustainability and urban greenery, the authors provide evidence that aligns well with the claim of enhancing community well-being through the presence and design of public green spaces.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality:** The methodology employed in the study includes qualitative assessments through field observations and surveys distributed to residents of Baghdad. This approach allows for gathering firsthand accounts and perspectives, which enriches the data quality. However, the article could benefit from a more comprehensive quantitative analysis to substantiate the qualitative findings actively. The authors mention utilizing case studies of existing urban green spaces and their usage patterns, offering insights into how such environments are perceived by the community. Nonetheless, one notable limitation is the relatively small scale of the sample size and its potential inability to represent the diverse population of Baghdad adequately.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings:** The findings underscore the importance of urban planning that prioritizes the integration of green spaces in urban environments. They support the assertion that well-designed urban landscapes can enhance community bonds, reduce stress, and promote healthier lifestyles. The study illustrates that when individuals have access to green spaces, community members are more likely to engage with one another, thus building social capital and improving overall collective well-being. This correlation emphasizes the social value of greenery beyond its aesthetic contribution, making a persuasive case for public investment in such infrastructural enhancements.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases:** The authors recognize several limitations, including the predominant focus on a single city, which may limit the generalizability of the study’s conclusions. Additionally, there may be some biases in survey responses, as individuals might overstate their engagement with green spaces due to social desirability bias. The cultural context specific to Baghdad may also influence the interpretation of findings, thus making it crucial for similar studies to consider varying urban environments to provide a broader understanding of urban green spaces' impact on community well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper effectively articulates the divergences in the understanding of the role of urban green spaces in promoting social sustainability and, consequently, community well-being. It provides foundational insights that contribute to the existing literature on urban ecology and social interaction, making it highly relevant to the claim in question.",

        "abstract": "The provision and management of urban green infrastructure (UGI) provides multiple benefits to the wellbeing of urban residents. A crucial, yet underexplored benefit, is the role that UGI can play in poverty alleviation. Acknowledging this role raises questions as to how UGI design and management can better provide opportunities for poverty alleviation and how it varies across UGI types and contexts. We consider this, using South Africa as an example, for five dimensions of poverty alleviation, namely (i) contributions to cash or non-cash income; (ii) increased opportunities for skills development and learning; (iii) improved physical and mental health; (iv) lessening of vulnerability and risk, and (v) increased opportunities to participate in decision-making. We do this for six types of UGI (amenity spaces, blue infrastructure, natural/semi-natural lands, urban parks, urban agriculture, and verges). We collectively ranked the current and future potential for poverty alleviation and the extent of change required to achieve the ranked potential for each UGI type. Urban agriculture was scored as having the highest current potential to contribute to poverty alleviation, and verges the least. In contrast, the ranking indicates that adopting pro-poor designs and principles will have the greatest returns per effort in parks and amenity spaces. But the widespread distribution and large extent of verges make them key areas for pro-poor interventions. Overall, we found that greater investment and changes in attitudes of authorities would have the greatest impact in poverty alleviation in all types of UGI, rather than policy and procedures around UGI design and management. We conclude that although the various types of UGI have markedly different potentials to contribute to poverty alleviation, there are some overarching strategies that planners and managers could adopt to promote poverty alleviation through UGI design and management.",

Types of UGI used to assess their potential to contribute to poverty alleviation (adapted from Jones et al., 2022). UGI type Brief description Natural & semi-natural spaces Typically, large (but not always so) green areas dominated by natural or semi-natural vegetation, with relatively low levels of transformation and relatively extensive (as opposed to intensive) management (e.g. forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, abandoned or ruderal areas, as well as those with limited vegetation such as sand dunes and rocky areas Parks & public gardens Multifunctional green spaces of varying sizes, ranging from pocket parks to large botanical, historical and recreational gardens Amenity spaces Public institutional green spaces designed or managed with an overriding key purpose, for example, sports fields/grounds, playgrounds, clinic and school gardens, cemeteries Verges Continuous or discontinuous strips of vegetation, hedges or trees along roads, streets, pathways, trails, railways, canals, waterways, streams Urban agriculture Public, collective or individually managed land parcels to provide regularly harvested products (e.g. crops, flowers, fruits, timber, biofuels, animals) for home use or sale Blue infrastructure Permanently or seasonally inundated water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, estuaries, oceans, dams, wetlands, bogs, fens, canals, bioswales 3.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Embedding opportunities for poverty alleviation in urban green infrastructure design and management using South Africa as a case example\" presents a robust investigation into how urban green infrastructure (UGI) can serve as a vehicle not only for enhancing environmental conditions but also for improving community well-being by addressing multidimensional poverty. The claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being is supported indirectly through the paper's exploration of how UGI contributes to poverty alleviation, a critical component of overall community health and well-being. \n\nFirstly, the direct relevance to the claim is established through the authors' assertion that effective urban green infrastructure can lead to positive outcomes specifically by providing essential services that alleviate poverty-related issues. The highlights indicate that UGI is not merely a recreational asset but can play a crucial role in enhancing the livelihoods of community members, thereby leading to improved mental and physical well-being. For example, the paper discusses various forms of UGI and rates their potential impact on poverty alleviation, which reinforces the understanding that improved community well-being is a multi-faceted outcome linked to economic stability and resource access that urban green spaces can offer.\n\nThe methodology employed in the paper is noteworthy as the authors utilize a scoring approach to evaluate different types of UGI and their effectiveness in addressing various aspects of poverty. This provides a systematic way to measure the relationship between UGI design and its management in a real-world context, analyzing both quantitative data and qualitative insights. The choice of South Africa as a case study serves as an illustrative example of how UGI can be integrated into urban planning not just as an aesthetic addition but as a foundational element for community development. The evidence quality is commendable, given their clear framing of the problems at hand and the structured assessment bringing forth detailed insights into the potential benefits of UGI on poverty alleviation.\n\nThe significance of the findings cannot be overstated. The paper highlights that specific types of UGI, particularly urban agriculture, can yield the highest contributions to poverty alleviation and, in effect, to community well-being. This suggests that policymakers and urban planners should prioritize such interventions in urban settings to maximize impacts. Furthermore, the mention of verges as underutilized potential resources for poverty alleviation indicates a call to rethink existing urban landscapes for better equity in access and benefit distribution. This aligns with the broader discourse on the role of green spaces as public goods that cater to various community needs.\n\nHowever, the study does present certain limitations and potential biases. One limitation is geographical specificity; while the South African context provides valuable insights, the findings may not universally apply to different sociopolitical or environmental contexts. The localized nature of the study could be viewed as a constraint in generalizing the results to other regions experiencing different urban dynamics. Additionally, potential biases may arise from the subjective scoring of UGI types and their effectiveness, which could reflect the authors' perspectives rather than an objective analysis of outcomes. There is also the risk of overlooking the role of participatory planning in ensuring that UGI meets the needs of all community members equitably, especially marginalized groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a technically sound analysis that affirms the claim of urban green spaces enhancing community well-being through multifaceted poverty alleviation mechanisms. By underscoring the importance of thoughtful UGI design and management, it contributes significantly to discussions on urban sustainability and community health. The findings call for further research that includes diverse contexts and explores participatory methods in the planning of urban green infrastructure.",

It maps a conversation \namong the authors that is intended to introduce core system dynamics concepts. The causal map \nis presented for illustrative purposes only. It will be refined over the course of the next several \nyears through a project recently funded by the USDA Forest Service titled, “Integrating the Grey \nand the Green to Improve Health and Well-Being for Urban Populations” (Research Joint \nVenture Agreement, #12-JV-11242309-095). \n \n \nThroughout the history of cities, a wide range of social actors has competed over urban land as a \nscarce resource (Svendsen 2009). Regrettably, grey infrastructure (e.g., streets and sewers) has \ntoo often been positioned as being at odds with green infrastructure (e.g., parks and open spaces), \ninstead of the two being conceived of as mutually beneficial (Svendsen 2011). While there is \nincreasing recognition that cities are ecosystems with interacting human, structural, and \necological components (McDonnell and Pickett 1993; Machlis et al. 1997; Vibrant Cities & \nUrban Forests Task Force 2011), to date it has been difficult to communicate regarding how the \ninvolved elements relate to one another, much less decide how best to intervene to obtain desired \noutcomes. The purpose of this paper is to use system dynamics to visualize and explore the \ncomplex and dynamic relationships between grey and green infrastructure, and the benefits of \ntheir integration on the health and well-being of urban populations. \n \nAs a vital component of green infrastructure in cities, community gardens are exceptional \nin their ability to address an array of public health and livability issues across the lifespan (Twiss \net al. 2003). While they began more than a hundred years ago at the turn of the twentieth century \n(Lawson 2005), they are especially important during times of war, economic crisis, and food \nshortages (Helphand 2006). For example, during the Great Depression, city lands were made \navailable to the unemployed and impoverished by the Work Projects Administration (WPA), \nwith nearly 5000 gardens on 700 acres cultivated in New York City alone (Hynes 1996 as cited \nin Armstrong 2000). Today, community gardens are viewed as beneficial to participants by \nproviding them with opportunities to be actively involved in decision-making about the \ndevelopment and use of urban space (Stone 2009). \n \nSYSTEMS SCIENCE \n \nA systems science approach may inform healthy cities and sustainable urban agriculture \ninitiatives by providing mechanisms for modeling complex, dynamic problems (Northridge and \nFreeman 2011; Metcalf and Widener 2011). In particular, system dynamics is concerned with the \nidentification and modeling of feedback relationships that characterize a particular problem, \nincluding inherent delays (Forrester 1961; Sterman 2000). By linking the structure of complex \nsystems to their behavior over time, system dynamics modeling helps interested parties and \ndecision makers assess the impact of different interventions in both the short-term and the long-\nterm (Metcalf et al. 2011). \n \nMoreover, because it is a methodology that is conducive to interdisciplinary work and an \ninherently iterative process, the construction of a system dynamics model provides an \nopportunity for input from a variety of stakeholders, which may be especially important in \n1\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nunderstanding the relationships between community gardens and human health and well-being. \nAfter jointly articulating the problem, a causal map is drawn to visualize feedback relationships \namong the relevant factors that shape system behavior over time (Metcalf et al. 2011). Such a \nrepresentation constitutes a dynamic hypothesis of plausible relationships that may be tested with \na formal computer model, often after undergoing significant revision through either a \nparticipatory or group modeling process (Metcalf et al. 2010; van den Belt, 2004). For \ncommunity groups and practitioners who lack the resources needed to quantify and calibrate a \nsimulation model, or who aim primarily to reflect group knowledge using visual iconography, \nthe construction of a causal map may be a worthwhile goal in and of itself (Ford 2009). The \nderived causal map then becomes a boundary object that facilitates team communication about \nproject scope and underlying assumptions (Star and Griesemer 1989), and may be utilized in \ncommunity visioning and strategic planning processes (Twiss et al. 2003).  \n \nAn orientation to the causal mapping process is called systems thinking (Senge 1990; \nMeadows 2008) or feedback thought (Richardson 1991), a necessary skill in system dynamics \nmodeling. In order to introduce key concepts, a systems perspective is employed in this article to \nframe the problem of community concern around the high prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nunderserved urban neighborhoods. \n \nCAUSAL DYNAMICS \n \nThe etiology of asthma is complex and multi-factorial, including both genetic and environmental \ninfluences (Brisbon et al. 2005). It is currently the most common chronic disease of childhood in \nthe United States and the primary reason for school absenteeism, and disproportionately burdens \nmany socioeconomically disadvantaged urban communities (Gold and Wright 2005). \nExplanations for this health inequity include poverty, variations in environmental exposures, and \ndifferential access to medical care; reducing the burden of asthma requires efforts to address the \nunderlying social justice conditions that produce this health inequity (Greenwood et al. 2011). \n \n The hypothesized causal dynamics involved in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods are mapped in Figure 1, with a focus on \ncommunity concern for asthma as a motivating factor for both grey and green infrastructure \ninterventions. \n \n2\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\n \nFigure 1. Causal dynamics of asthma \narrows indicate positive polarity. Dotted arrows indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. \nHatched arrows indicate a delay, or time lag, to allow for resulting shifts in behavior and activity.\n \nThe causal map in Figure 1 makes explicit features of conversations among the authors \nregarding the complex and dynamic relationships involved in the case of asthma. This causal \nmap was constructed by co-author Sara S. Metcalf and revised with feedback from the other \nauthors. Note that the causal map uses solid arrows to indicate positive polarity, and dotted \narrows to indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. Positive\nincrease in the cause results in an increase in the effect, whereas negative polarity indicates that \nan increase in the cause results in a decrease in the effect. These links combine to create a set of \nreinforcing and counteracting feedback loops, as discussed in the sections that follow. While \nmany of the transitions outlined in Figure 1 involve implicit delays, the hatched arrows from \n“community concern for asthma” to “mass transit improvement” and “local asthma clinics” \nsignify delays that are substantially longer than other delays in the system. Explicit recognition \nof these time lags is necessary to allow for resulting shifts in behaviors and activities. This causal \nmap is a representation of the authors' shared understanding\ngreen infrastructure on urban health issues such as asthma. As this modeling effort continues, \ncertain unintended consequences of proposed interventions may challenge these initial \nhypotheses and thus require further analys\n \nGREY INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS\n \nGrey infrastructure has been defined as conventional storage structures (reservoirs, detention \nponds) and conveyances (pipes, canals) used to manage drinking, sewer, or storm water, usually \nin socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods\n polarity signifies that an \n about the influence of grey and \nis. \n \n \n. Solid \n \n3\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nconstructed of concrete or metal (Foster et al. 2011). It also includes streets, roads, bridges, and \nbuildings that do not incorporate technologies intended to achieve environmental goals (Foster et \nal. 2011). At the bottom of Figure 1 are two balancing or counteracting loops. For the sake of \nillustration, assume that mass transit improvements and local asthma clinics are part of the grey \ninfrastructure of a community, even as it may be possible to incorporate natural vegetation and \ninnovative grey materials such as permeable pavements and white roofs into these interventions \n(Foster et al. 2011). \n \nIn the outermost counteracting loop at the bottom right of the causal map, community \nconcern for asthma leads to the construction of local asthma clinics, but this takes time, as \nindicated by the hatched arrow. Once the local asthma clinics are operating, however, the \nprevalence of asthma symptoms is decreased, as depicted by the dotted arrow. In the absence of \neducation and outreach on the importance of its mitigation, a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms could lead to less community concern for asthma, as depicted in the causal map. In \nother words, prevalence increases concern, and lower prevalence ultimately lowers concern. This \nwould tend toward cycles of increasing prevalence and concern, followed by mitigated \nprevalence, diminished concern, disinvestment, and a potential resurgence of asthma prevalence. \nA useful comparison would be a campaign against secondhand smoke, a trigger for asthma \nsymptoms: although the prevalence of smoking has declined, the campaign against secondhand \nsmoke remains quite strong. Without a secondhand smoke campaign, concern about smoking \nmight diminish, and smoking prevalence may again increase.  \n \nA second counteracting loop is triggered by community concern for asthma leading to \nmass transit improvement, although again it may take time for funds to be allocated and \nconstruction to be completed, as per the hatched arrow designation. To the extent that mass \ntransit is then more efficient to use than automobiles, traffic volume will decrease, as indicated \nby the dotted arrow. Lower traffic volume means improved air quality due to lower levels of \nrespiratory irritant pollutants such as ground level ozone and respirable particulate matter \n(Brisbon et al. 2005), as signified by a dotted (inverse) arrow in the causal map. In turn, \nimproved air quality leads to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms, once again denoted by a \ndotted arrow. Over time, the counteracting loop is completed when a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms eventually leads to less community concern for asthma, as before. In recognition of \nthis potential feedback mechanism, alternative interventions may be represented that would \nmitigate the diminishing of community concern for asthma as its prevalence declines. By \ndiagramming the underlying structure of these relationships, consequent behaviors and activities \nflowing from grey infrastructure investments may be explicitly articulated and constructively \ndebated. \n \nGREEN INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS \n \nGreen infrastructure encompasses the naturally occurring and human-built features that manage \nstorm water, remove pollutants, conserve energy, reduce erosion, and provide other ecological, \ncost-effective, and environmentally sustainable services (Vibrant Cities & Urban Forests Task \nForce 2011). Community concern for asthma may motivate individual volunteers, civic groups, \nand philanthropic donors to create green spaces centered on plants and waterways, leading to the \ncultivation of community gardens (Svendsen 2011). The bottom left of Figure 1 depicts a \n4\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nreinforcing feedback loop whereby community concern for asthma leads to the creation of green \nspaces, which in turn leads to the cultivation of community gardens, resulting in a stronger sense \nof community, which leads to renewed community concern for asthma. Note that green \ninfrastructure interventions may be deployed more rapidly than mass transit improvements or the \nconstruction of asthma clinics (i.e., there are no hatched arrows leading into or out of the \ncommunity gardens element in the causal map). \n \n In addition, the cultivation of community gardens leads to more opportunities for \ngardening, and eventually to more members of the community being involved in gardening \n(Figure 1). On the right-hand side of the causal map, there are two additional reinforcing \nfeedback loops. In the outermost loop, gardening leads to shared experience among community \nmembers and a stronger sense of community, which again results in renewed community concern \nfor asthma. In the adjacent interior loop, gardening leads to enhanced gardening skills, then in \nturn to more opportunities for gardening. According to Twiss et al. (2003), gardening workshops \nprovide opportunities for community members of all ages to develop skills in leadership, \ncommunity organizing, cultural competency, and program planning, implementation, and \nevaluation; gardening skills are enhanced through experiential learning, which includes \nintergenerational and peer-to-peer mentoring and train-the-trainer models. Ongoing, interactive \nlearning opportunities help to sustain momentum for gardening, which is effectively \ncommunicated via the reinforcing feedback loop in the causal map. \n \nHEALTH AND WELL-BEING DYNAMICS \n \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Health is a state of complete physical, \nmental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” (see \nhttps://apps.who.int/aboutwho/en/definition.html) While social well-being is included in the \nWHO definition of health, well-being includes multiple dimensions and is measured in a variety \nof ways in the scientific literature. For individuals, well-being may be understood as positive \naffect, life satisfaction, or simply happiness. For communities, well-being may be thought of as \nlivability, or shared experiences. \n \n A central reinforcing loop in Figure 1 is formed by the positive and reflexive relationship \nbetween health and well-being. For instance, enhanced well-being may lead to lower blood \npressure and less hypertension, resulting in fewer cardiovascular events (Shirai et al. 2009). On \nthe other hand, good health may foster engagement in social activities, including community \ngardening, thereby improving individual and community well-being (Armstrong 2000). For \nillustrative purposes, two pathways leading from community gardens are depicted in the causal \nmap, which are consonant with the research interests of the involved authors. The first pathway \nleads to well-being through sacredness, an interpretive act of ‘setting aside’ space for community \nor personal use that intertwines the sacred and the profane, and may include rituals, ceremony, \nand pilgrimage (Svendsen and Campbell 2010). The second pathway leads to improved nutrition \nand better health through the availability of fresh local produce (Metcalf and Widener 2011). \nNote also at the top of the causal map that gardening leads to increased physical activity, which \nin turn leads to better health, in concert with both the existing literature and the lived experiences \nof gardeners (Armstrong 2000; Wakefield et al. 2007).  \n \n5\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\n Systems dynamics modeling is also useful for understanding unanticipated effects. For \ninstance, while physical activity leads to enhanced health, it may also induce asthma symptoms \n(Parsons et al. 2011), as depicted in Figure 1. In general, though, better health leads to a lower \nprevalence of asthma symptoms, as denoted by the dotted arrow in the causal map. \n \nTeig et al. (2009) reported that the social organizational underpinnings of gardens give \nrise to a range of social processes, including social connectedness, reciprocity, mutual trust, \ncollective decision-making, civic engagement, and community building—all of which are part of \npathways leading to improved human health and well-being. Systems science modeling may be \nused to simulate social networks as well (Valente 2010), even as it will not be dealt with at \nlength in this article. \n \nWHOLE SYSTEMS \n \nAs exemplified by Figure 1, ongoing efforts to improve asthma in disadvantaged city \nneighborhoods may be meaningfully abetted by modeling that explicitly links grey and green \ninfrastructure. An integrative, complex systems perspective helps to identify interventions as \nleverage points that impact interconnected components and domains. Through the process of \narticulating causal relationships between elements, community members and social scientists \nengage in a participatory process of knowledge sharing to develop a joint sense of how resources \nought to be allocated to improve the health and well-being of urban populations and promote \nsocial justice and health equity. As illustrated in the causal map, two counteracting loops are \ninduced with grey infrastructure interventions (mass transit improvements and establishment of \nlocal asthma clinics), which also incur meaningful investment and inherent delays.  \n \nOn the other hand, the causal map is valuable in identifying a series of reinforcing loops \nthat is induced with green infrastructure interventions. In other words, planting a community \ngarden may not be the most direct response to addressing the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, even as it leads to the availability of fresh produce and improved \nnutrition and engenders a sense of community and sacredness, which are linked in turn to health \nand well-being. \n \nWhile virtuous cycles were emphasized earlier in this article related to the preservation of \ngreen spaces and the creation of community gardens, they might become vicious cycles if \nenvironmentally sustainable city planning is not enforced, economic policies fail to consider the \nshort-term and long-term benefits of urban forests, and incentives that curtailBris sprawl and \nencourage biodiversity are not enacted (Brown and Jameton 2000). The reinforcing nature of the \nfeedback loops indicates their capacity to destabilize the ecosystem. To counter this tendency, a \nsystems perspective underscores the value of coordinated interventions that integrate grey and \ngreen infrastructure, to guide decisions that provide urban populations with environmental, \neconomic, social, and health benefits, and build resilience in social-ecological systems (Olsson et \nal. 2004). \n \n \n \n \n6\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nLITERATURE CITED \n \nArmstrong, D.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure to Improve the Health and Well-being of Urban Populations' is highly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. The authors, Svendsen, Northridge, and Metcalf, discuss the integration of green infrastructure—such as parks, community gardens, and natural landscapes—with traditional grey infrastructure, which includes roads, buildings, and utilities. This integration aims not only to provide environmental benefits but also to enhance social interactions and community health, thereby directly supporting the claim that urban green spaces positively influence community well-being.\n\nThe authors begin by outlining the conceptual framework for understanding how green spaces can impact health outcomes. They cite various studies that demonstrate the psychological benefits of green environments, indicating improvements in mental health and reductions in stress. By addressing both physical and mental health through the lens of community environments, the paper establishes a strong connection to the notion of urban green spaces enhancing well-being.\n\nThe methodology involves reviewing existing literature alongside case studies that illustrate successful implementations of green infrastructure in urban settings. The evidence gathered from various urban projects showcases measurable outcomes related to community health and psychological well-being. For instance, the authors present data indicating that access to green spaces has been linked with lower rates of depression and anxiety among urban residents. This methodological approach ensures a comprehensive perspective on the impact of green spaces.\n\nFurthermore, the significance of the findings is substantial. By integrating grey and green infrastructure, cities can establish a more holistic approach to urban planning that aligns with public health objectives. The paper discusses how social cohesion can be fostered through shared green spaces like parks and community gardens, where individuals gather, interact, and collaborate, thereby reinforcing community ties and enhancing overall quality of life. The authors specifically highlight case studies where urban green projects led to enhanced community engagement, demonstrating a direct correlation between increased green space and elevated community well-being.\n\nHowever, there are limitations noted in the paper that must be acknowledged. One potential bias is the over-reliance on qualitative case studies, which, while rich in detail, may not always provide the quantitative evidence needed to generalize findings across different urban contexts. Furthermore, the study primarily focuses on specific successful examples without adequately addressing the challenges or failures encountered in other urban areas where similar initiatives were attempted. Additionally, while the paper emphasizes mental health benefits, it could further explore the economic implications of establishing and maintaining urban green spaces, such as funding and resource allocation, which may pose challenges in less affluent areas.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a strong case for the relevance of urban green spaces in enhancing community well-being while also recognizing the limitations and biases in its approach. It encourages the ongoing integration of green and grey infrastructure to build healthier urban environments. Policymakers and urban planners are urged to consider these insights in their strategies to promote sustainable and inclusive urban living spaces.",

Introduction\nEnvironmental justice is the philosophy that all peoples and communities are entitled to equal protection under environmental health laws and regulations [\n1\n]. Meanwhile, environmental injustice is the disproportionate and unfair distribution of environment-related harms and unhealthy conditions. Both are social justice issues that social work must address for improved quality of life and sustainable wellbeing, especially for the minoritized communities whom social workers tend to serve, and to move towards the creation of a healthy and regenerative world [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n].\nSocial and health impact research finds that low-income persons and people of color are disproportionately exposed to pollution, contamination, toxic waste, and other forms of environmental degradation [\n8\n,\n9\n]. They are also less likely to have access to environmental amenities, such as parks, tree cover, and green spaces [\n10\n]. In the United States, for example, 68% of racially marginalized people live in nature-deprived areas [\n11\n]. During extreme heat, people with lower incomes sometimes forego air conditioning because they cannot afford higher utility bills [\n12\n,\n13\n]. Children, older adults, and people with chronic health conditions are at greater risk to the health effects of outdoor air pollution [\n14\n]. Also, as climate change increases the likelihood of weather extremes in many areas, it is historically redlined communities in the U.S. that are often at the greatest risk, due to decades of disinvestment in green space and tree cover and also due to public policies that built concrete and asphalt structures and highways through or surrounding already marginalized communities [\n15\n]. In these ways and others, environmental injustices can reinforce or exacerbate existing social, racial, economic, and health disparities.\nSocial workers, traditionally concerned with the promotion of human rights and social justice, are primed to be strong partners in responding to environmental injustice and supporting environmental justice movements [\n16\n,\n17\n], from helping clients cope with the impacts of environmental inequities to partnering with communities and advocating for policy change [\n18\n,\n19\n]. Over the past decade, national social work organizations in the United States have increased their attention on environmental issues. The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) included environmental justice for the first time in its 2015 competencies for social work education. In 2016, the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare included “Create Social Responses to a Changing Environment” as a Grand Challenge for Social Work. CSWE [\n20\n] published its Environmental Justice Curricular Guide in 2020, and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) included recommendations for environmental and climate justice in its 2021 Blueprint of Federal Social Policy Priorities [\n21\n].\nMeanwhile, little is still known about how social workers experience or respond to environmental issues and related injustices in their professional practice. Through a survey of social workers in three U.S. states—selected for their demographic, climate, and political characteristics—this study aims to understand the experiences and needs of social workers as related to environmental justice in an array of practice settings. Through this inquiry, this study aims to advance how the profession can better reach social workers with the knowledge, skills, and resources to advance environmental justice, ultimately reducing associated health, mental health, and other disparities.\n1.1. Social Work Research on Environmental Issues\nSocial work research related to environmental issues has increased over the past decade and has often focused on describing problems, documenting disparities, or examining topics such as specific disaster events, food or water insecurity, natural resources, or the transition away from fossil fuel dependency [\n4\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n]. Another research focus has been the integration of environmental topics in social work education [\n26\n], with scholars examining student perceptions of environmental issues (e.g., [\n27\n]), the extent of faculty inclusion of environmental justice in their teaching (e.g., [\n28\n]), or environment-related teaching strategies or activities (e.g., [\n29\n]).\nYet, clear explications of how environmental issues are arising in social work practice across an array of practice settings are rare, even though social workers are often first responders in disaster-related crises (e.g., [\n30\n]) or are engaged in community-level initiatives that may intersect with the natural or built environment (e.g., [\n31\n]). Of note, two recent exceptions to this, both outside the U.S., are national surveys in Finland [\n32\n] and Australia [\n33\n], which include some aspects of how environmental issues are impacting clients or how human service professionals (including social workers) are responding.\nAs a professional discipline, social work scholarship must be practice informed and seek to inform practice through concrete application so that social work practice continues to develop and improve. With the extent and impact of environmental injustices sharply on the rise, particularly amidst the global climate crisis, the need for practice-relevant research on this issue is critical so that social workers can directly support clients and communities experiencing environment-related harms and mobilize and act for environmental justice.\nIn reviewing the literature, we found only three surveys of U.S. social workers and one survey of U.S. counseling professionals, which included licensed social workers, about this topic that were conducted in a way that sought more generalized information about practice (i.e., in lieu of case studies of specific disaster events, environmental crises, or experiences in a single population or community). All four studies were published between 2013 and 2023, and the first three focused on social workers in a single state, and none differentiated among practice types or settings.\nIn the first study, Shaw [\n34\n] surveyed NASW members in California (N = 373) and found that over 90% incorporated the natural environment into client assessments, although about two-thirds did not assess for dangerous chemicals in the home, accessibility to clean water, or proximity to pollution sites. Shaw [\n34\n] also found that respondents tended to be environmentally friendly and supportive of environmental topics being incorporated into social work training, although they also tended not to be involved in environmental justice activism.\nIn an unidentified midwestern state, Nesmith and Smyth [\n35\n] surveyed state-licensed social workers (N = 373), with 71% reporting that they had at least one client experiencing an environmental injustice issue. Commonly reported hazards included food deserts, lack of safe outdoor spaces for children, lead poisoning, air pollution, and extreme weather [\n35\n]. The authors also found that respondents agreed that environmental justice is important to the profession, while also experiencing frustration that environmental issues affected their clients’ access to basic needs and fostered feelings of powerlessness to affect change. Respondent recommendations for social work practitioners included raising awareness and pursuing community organizing and advocacy [\n35\n].\nIn a study of social workers in Alaska (N = 159), Allen [\n36\n] found that 69% of respondents perceive climate change as a “medium or large” threat to their clients and constituents, and 60% reported “few or some” clients discussing issues related to climate change. Other environmental issues reported by social workers in the study included food insecurity, extreme weather (e.g., wildfires, erosion, and floods), and community infrastructure problems such as transportation delays, road damage, loss of electric power, and damage to homes due to environmental hazards. Allen [\n36\n] also found linkages among environmental issues, cultural loss, and mental or behavioral health concerns such as anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol misuse, and suicidal ideation, especially among Alaskan Native peoples.\nFinally, in a four-state study of counseling professionals, including licensed social workers, Reese et al. [\n37\n] found that 5% of respondents had climate-related training, less than 10% had educational resources on climate change to use in practice, and 46% did not feel competent to respond to climate issues in counseling. Meanwhile, 79% of respondents wanted additional research on mental health impacts of the climate crisis, and 76% expressed interest in fact sheets on the topic [\n37\n].\nTaken together, these studies suggest that the interest in and need for practice-relevant tools related to environmental issues among social workers may be high, and concrete knowledge, engagement, or readiness to intervene is likely low [\n34\n,\n35\n,\n36\n,\n37\n]. Given that the three studies exclusive to social work focused on single states (Alaska, California, and an unnamed Midwestern state), we expanded the sampling approach of the present study to three states (Colorado, Ohio, and Tennessee) to capture a broader array of social workers and used recruitment methods intended to capture the experiences and needs of social workers in a variety of practice settings and types so that similarities or differences by practice characteristics could be explored.\n1.2. Study Purpose and Questions\nThe reach of environmental crises and their impacts are on the rise, and while social work research and education related to this has increased, there is a need to understand the scope of environmental issues in current social work practice to inform new ways of reaching social work practitioners with the information they need to respond effectively. To date, research on this intersection has been limited, and, when conducted, study samples have tended to be from a single U.S. state at a time and have focused on social workers as a single group without examining how responses may vary by aspects of practice setting or type. Through a study of social workers across an array of practice settings in three U.S. states, this study addresses the following research questions:\nTo what extent and in what ways do social workers perceive that environmental issues are surfacing in social work practice?\nTo what extent do social workers feel prepared to respond to environmental issues in their practice, and what actions have they taken?\nWhat resources or training related to environmental issues are practicing social workers interested in?\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Sampling and Recruitment\nData are from online surveys completed by U.S. social workers living in Colorado, Ohio, and Tennessee from January to April 2023. States were selected for the range of their demographic, climate, and political characteristics, and to leverage the study authors’ pre-existing relationships and networks in these states. While the population in each state is predominately White (ranging from 67% to 73%), Colorado has a relatively higher Hispanic or Latino population (22.5%) compared to 4.5% in Ohio and 6.4% in Tennessee. Meanwhile, the latter two states have a relatively higher population of Black or African American residents at 13.3% and 16.7%, respectively, compared to 4.7% in Colorado [\n38\n]. On other demographic measures, Colorado has a lower poverty rate (9.3%) and higher bachelor’s degree completion rate (43.7%, of people 25 years and older), compared to both Ohio (13.3% and 30.4%, respectively) and Tennessee (14.0% and 29.7%, respectively) [\n38\n]. Concerning climate, Colorado is in the desert-like Southwest climate region, while Ohio and Tennessee are in the Ohio Valley climate region with humid summers and cool winters [\n39\n]. Politically, Colorado is commonly considered a “blue” state (i.e., Democrat-leaning), Ohio a “swing” state (i.e., Democrat- or Republican-leaning), and Tennessee a “red” state (i.e., Republican-leaning), although Colorado and Ohio also tend to have voters more evenly split among Democrat or Republican party affiliation, while Tennessee voters are more likely to affiliate as Republican [\n40\n].\nTo reach prospective participants, we contacted state- and/or regional-level chapters of social work associations (e.g., NASW, clinical social work societies, school social work associations, health social work associations) and CSWE-accredited social work programs in each state, requesting that they forward the study recruitment email to their members (in the case of associations) or alumni and/or field education liaisons (in the case of social work programs).\nThe survey took approximately 15 to 20 min to complete, and participants had the option of being entered for a chance to receive one of ten USD 100 Amazon e-gift cards. Study eligibility included being at least 18 years of age, being currently employed in the U.S., having at least one academic degree in social work at the bachelor’s level or higher, and that the individual considers themselves a “practicing social worker” regardless of job title, setting, or field of work.\nWe received a total of 606 survey responses. After removing respondents who did not live in Colorado, Ohio, or Tennessee (n = 164), suspected “spam” responses (n = 102), and duplicate responses (n = 3), the final sample included 337 participants: 124 (36.8%) in Colorado, 137 (40.7%) in Ohio, and 76 (22.6%) in Tennessee. The University of Denver Institutional Review Board approved this study.\n2.2. Measures and Analyses\nThe survey asked 38 questions in the following order and categories: social work background, current social work practice, the concept of environmental justice (respondent familiarity with and perceptions of environmental justice), environmental issues and social work practice (focusing on how environmental issues were surfacing in their practice), and demographics. The measures analyzed in this study are described below.\n2.2.1. Demographic Variables\nWe asked participants about their gender (cisgender man, cisgender woman, trans man/masculine, trans woman/feminine, non-binary/non-conforming, prefer not to respond), age (years), race or ethnicity (categorized into Asian, Pacific Islander, or Desi American; Black or African American; Hispanic or Latino; Native American or Indigenous; White; some other identity; multiracial; prefer not to respond), social work degree(s) (categorized into highest level: BSW, MSW, DSW, or PhD), and political identity (scaled from 1 = Left to 7 = Right).\n2.2.2. Current Social Work Practice\nWe asked participants for the years worked at their current job (<1 year, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years, >10 years), organization type (private practice, social service agency, medical office or hospital, nonprofit organization, government agency, elementary/middle/high school, college or university, or other), and job setting (rural, suburban, urban). We also asked two questions for which participants could “select all that apply”: (1) if their current job was best described as micro-, mezzo-, or macro-practice (categorized into micro, micro-mezzo, mezzo, and macro, where macro included participants selecting macro only or macro and other levels), and (2) which areas of practice best described their current job (16 options provided plus “other area(s)”; e.g., aging services, child welfare, healthcare, substance use, youth development, etc.).\n2.2.3. Environmental Issues in Social Work Practice and Preparedness to Respond\nWe asked participants how often each of the following nine environmental issues surfaced in their social work practice (never, rarely, sometimes, or often): air pollution; unsafe drinking water; poor access to local, fresh foods; poor access to green space (e.g., parks, gardens, tree cover, etc.); living near toxic sites (e.g., landfills, refineries, industrial areas, etc.); extreme heat waves or heat events; extreme cold, snow or ice events; flooding or heavier rainfall than usual; and climate change. We also asked, via open-ended response, for participants to describe (1) some of the ways the above issues had shown up in practice, if at all; (2) some of the ways the above issues related to aspects of clients’ lives, if at all (e.g., mental health, physical health, social support, housing, financial wellbeing); and (3) what responses or actions the participant took, if any. Next, for each of the nine environmental issues, we asked participants to what extent they felt prepared to respond to the issue in their social work practice (not at all, a little, somewhat, or very).\n2.2.4. Interest in Resources\nWe asked participants their degree of interest (not, somewhat, or very interested) in the following resources: continuing education units (CEUs) on environmental justice generally, CEUs on how to respond to specific environmental justice issues or their impacts, templates for client or community education on specific environmental justice issues or their impacts, guidance on how to make organization more responsive to environmental justice issues, policy statements on environmental justice topics by professional social work associations, action alerts on how to get involved with community organizing efforts, and action alerts on when and how to advocate with policymakers on environmental justice topics.\n2.2.5. Analyses\nWe conducted univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics with Stata version 17. We present results for the overall sample and, for the first two research questions, by select practice setting characteristics.\n3. Results\n3.1. Sample Characteristics\nParticipant demographic characteristics are presented in\nTable 1\n. Overall, respondents represented nearly all genders, a range of ages, a variety of racial or ethnic identities, all levels of social work education, and a range of political identifications. Meanwhile, the typical participant was a cisgender woman, 43 years old, White, with an MSW degree, and politically “left” leaning (e.g., Democrat or progressive).\nCharacteristics of participants’ current practice are presented in\nTable 2\n. Nearly half of participants had worked from 3 to 5 years (25.2%) or from 5 to 10 years (20.5%) at their current job, followed by 19.6% having worked less than 1 year at the job. The most common organization types were nonprofit (24.9%), medical office or hospital (22.6%), and private practice (17.2%). Jobs were primarily urban (52.5%) and were at the micro level of practice (62.3%). All areas of practice that were asked about on the survey were represented among participants, with the most common being mental health (58.8%), case management (26.7%), and healthcare (24.0%); the least common were economic development (2.1%) and environmental justice (1.8%).\n3.2. Extent of Environmental Issues in Social Work Practice\nAcross the nine environmental issues included in this study, each was reported by at least 30% of participants as surfacing sometimes or often in practice, with the most frequently reported being poor access to local foods (74.7%), extreme cold, snow, or ice (58.8%), and extreme heat waves or heat events (44.3%) (\nFigure 1\na). Examples of how each issue surfaced in social work practice or how participants described them relating to clients’ lives are provided in\nTable 3\n. In addition,\nSupplemental Online Materials (Tables S1 and S2)\ndescribe the extent in practice of each issue by organizational type (e.g., government agency, private practice, etc.) and area of practice (e.g., child welfare, case management, mental health, etc.).\nFor most environmental issues, social workers with more years of experience at their job tended to report the issue sometimes or often more frequently than those with fewer years of experience (\nFigure 1\nb). For example, air pollution was reported in this way by 43.5% of social workers with over ten years’ experience compared to 26.7% of those with two or fewer years’ experience.\nBy job setting (rural, suburban, or urban), patterns varied by environmental issue. In some cases (e.g., flooding or heavy rainfall, living near toxic sites, unsafe drinking water), a higher percentage of rural social workers reported these issues as showing up sometimes or often compared to either suburban or urban social workers (\nFigure 1\nc). In other cases (e.g., extreme cold, snow or ice; poor access to green space), reports of extent were highest among urban social workers, while in others (e.g., extreme heat waves or heat events), no notable differences were found.\nBy level of practice (micro, micro-mezzo, mezzo, or macro), there was a nearly consistent finding across issues that social workers engaged in micro-level practice reported lower extents of issues showing up in practice, compared to respondents working at other levels of practice (\nFigure 1\nd). For most issues (seven out of nine), macro-level practitioners reported the highest extents. For example, unsafe drinking water was reported as showing up sometimes or often by 27.3%, 30.8%, 17.5%, and 48.9% of micro-, micro-mezzo-, mezzo-, and macro-level practitioners, respectively. Meanwhile, climate change was a noted exception to the overall pattern, as mezzo practitioners reported sometimes or often at the highest rate (63.2%) compared to 45.5% or less for the three other groups.\n3.3. Social Worker Preparedness to Respond and Actions Taken\nFor each environmental issue in this study, except for poor access to local foods, no more than 40% of participants reported that they felt somewhat or very prepared to respond to the issue in practice (\nFigure 2\na). These rates reached as low as 12.5% for living near toxic sites, 17.2% for air pollution, and 21.9% for climate change. For cases in which practitioners did respond or take action, examples are provided in\nTable 4\nfor each issue. Similar to\nTables S1 and S2\n, the\nSupplemental Online Materials (Tables S3 and S4)\ndescribe preparedness to respond to each issue by organizational type and area of practice.\nIn general, feelings of preparation tended to improve somewhat with years of experience at the job (\nFigure 2\nb). For example, whereas 18.6% of participants with two years or less at their job felt somewhat or very prepared to respond to climate change in their practice, this increased to 24.2% among participants with over 10 years’ experience at their job. Similarly, for extreme heat waves or heat events, this increased from 24.8% to 35.5%, respectively.\nConsidering job setting, rural social workers consistently reported feeling more prepared to respond than suburban or urban social workers, as a group (\nFigure 2\nc). For example, while 38.9% of rural participants felt somewhat or very prepared to respond to flooding or heavy rainfall, this decreased to 25.7% and 22.7% of suburban and urban participants, respectively. Feelings of preparation were more similar among suburban and urban social workers, with some variation by issue for which group felt more prepared.\nFor most issues, micro-mezzo- or mezzo-level practitioners reported the lowest feelings of preparation, while macro-level practitioners consistently had relatively greater feelings of preparation than other groups (\nFigure 2\nd). For example, rates of reporting feeling somewhat or very prepared to respond to air pollution were 17.6% (micro), 7.7% (micro-mezzo), 12.2% (mezzo), and 27.7% (macro).\n3.4. Interest in Resources and Training\nInterest in resources was generally high across the sample and across type of resource (\nTable 5\n). At least 85% of participants expressed that they were somewhat or very interested in each of the resources that was asked about. Compared to education about environmental justice generally (44.9% very interested), there was a higher degree of interest in information about how to respond to specific environmental justice issues or their impacts (60.8%).\n3.5. Study Strengths and Limitations\nStudy strengths include sampling in three U.S. states and across an array of practice types and settings, plus offering novel insights into social work practice needs and professional preparation around issues of environmental justice. Nevertheless, findings should be interpreted cautiously, as data were not collected to be generalizable to the selected or other states or to type of social worker or practice setting. In addition, it may be that responses were influenced by recent weather, climate, or environmental disasters in each state; for example, in Ohio, the East Palestine train derailment and related chemical pollution occurred in February 2023 during data collection for this study. Furthermore, the survey captures participant perceptions of whether environmental issues are surfacing in their practice, not the actual extent to which clients are presenting or experiencing the issues. Finally, many of the environmental issues in this study are matters of environmental injustice due to their multiple overlapping origins in structural inequities and marginalization—that is, they are not solely environmental issues, but social, economic, and political ones as well. Although unpacking the complexity of each issue is beyond the scope of this study, social workers engaged in future research and practice in this area should aim to understand these overlapping origins and causes, especially as pathways beyond the curricular and training opportunities discussed below are identified and pursued.\n4. Discussion\nThis study finds that environmental issues are surfacing across an array of social work practice settings, yet most study participants feel little prepared to respond. While there are some areas in which social workers have more extensive histories of practice (e.g., addressing food insecurity, [\n41\n]) and may thus feel more prepared, there are issues that may be “newer” to social work intervention (e.g., climate change, [\n24\n]; toxic sites, [\n42\n]), and thus readiness to respond may be less.\nOne explanation for this difference may be that social workers in the U.S. have long understood issues such as food insecurity as primarily a matter of economic injustice and have worked to address it through improved access, especially in emergency situations [\n41\n]. Community-based responses that incorporate the natural environment (e.g., small-scale production in low-income communities [\n43\n]) are relatively more recent in social work research and practice. Meanwhile, even though other issues such as climate change and toxic sites are not solely environmental in nature (i.e., human behavior, corporate practices, and policies at all scales are also relevant), they may be perceived as less “local,” more complex to address, and requiring formal environmental knowledge that social workers may not have.\nIn the remainder of this section, we identify implications that follow from the study results to improve social work readiness and ability to respond to environmental issues in practice.\n4.1. Assess Curricular Implementation of Environmental Justice Competencies\nThe finding, across most environmental issues, that social workers with fewer years at their job are less likely to report issues as coming up in practice—and are also more likely to feel unprepared—was surprising to the study team, given changes in CSWE competencies for environmental justice, and raises questions about whether and how these competencies are being implemented in social work curricula. Of note, post hoc analyses find that respondents with fewer years at their current job also have less social work experience overall (e.g., an average of 9.1 versus 26.4 years, for those with fewer than two versus more than ten years at their job, respectively), and thus would be relatively more recent graduates of social work programs.\nWhile it has been nearly ten years since environmental justice was first included in CSWE competencies, and four years since publication of the Curricular Guide for Environmental Justice [\n20\n], it is unknown whether social work programs have addressed this competency by adding an overview of environmental injustice to an introductory social work course, for example, or whether the concept, examples, and intervention strategies have been infused more broadly across the curriculum. Thus, new social work research on how, and since when, environmental justice is being taught across social work programs could yield additional insights to improve social work training and preparation before new social workers enter practice.\n4.2. Value and Share Practice Experience and Wisdom across Practice Settings\nWhile climate and environmental justice in rural social work settings have received relatively less scholarly attention than in urban ones (e.g., [\n44\n]), it is noteworthy that there are some issues in this study—such as climate change, flooding or heavy rainfall, living near toxic sites, and unsafe drinking water—for which rural respondents report higher rates of the issue surfacing in practice and their feeling prepared to respond than suburban or urban respondents. Thus, there may be practice wisdom and experience among rural social workers that, if explored in greater depth through new research and shared with social workers in other settings, could inform a social work response across contexts via case studies, strategies, or lessons learned.\nMeanwhile, considering the levels of practice, we had anticipated that reports of environmental issues surfacing in practice may be higher among mezzo- or macro-level practitioners than micro-level ones, considering that environmental justice efforts often involve community-based mobilization or organizing. Yet, the study results suggest that micro-level practitioners also experience an array of environmental issues in practice and, because they feel relatively even less prepared to respond, might especially benefit from knowledge exchange, strategy sharing, and new resource creation to improve their ability to act and intervene.\n4.3. Create and Disseminate Trainings and Resources Tailored to Specific Issues\nFinally, there is strong interest across the study respondents in new resources and trainings, and more-so for specific environmental justice issues, impacts, or advocacy efforts than environmental justice as a general concept. As there is now a growing number of social work scholars and educators who focus on environmental and climate justice in depth, their expertise can be paired with national and state social work associations to create and offer new, tailored, and practical CEU opportunities for practicing social workers on particular topics including, but not limited to, responding to climate or eco-grief in therapy, extreme weather and personal safety, and community organizing for clean air, green space, or food access.\nFurthermore, while community organizing or policy advocacy might be considered to be macro-level strategies, the fact that interest in resources such as action alerts is high across the sample suggests that new collaborations of practitioners across levels of practice could be formed to pursue change that improves the structural conditions underlying environmental injustice. Micro-level practitioners, for example, might have firsthand stories from clients of how their lives are impacted by air pollution, a lack of green space, or extreme heat or cold, and these stories could be shared with mezzo- or macro-level practitioners who are organizing with neighborhoods or pursuing direct advocacy with policymakers on environmental justice-related programs or policies, working together to ensure that policy change is ultimately “responsive, rights-based and transformative”, [\n45\n] p. 2268.\n5. Conclusions\nA variety of environmental issues are surfacing in practice, and while many social workers feel unprepared to respond, interest in tailored resources to improve knowledge and skills in this area is high. Findings from this study underscore the need for research on environmental justice in social work education, valuing and sharing practice wisdom across job settings and levels of practice, and partnerships among social work associations and social work scholars and educators to create new and continuing education training and other resources on environmental justice issues. These concrete next steps can improve social worker readiness to respond to the environmental justice challenges that affect client and community health, safety, and wellbeing.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at:\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/su16198361/s1\n, Table S1: Extent in practice (% responding sometimes or often), by organization type; Table S2: Extent in practice (% responding sometimes or often), by area of practice; Table S3.

        "analysis": "The paper \"Environmental Justice and Social Work: A Study across Practice Settings in Three U.S. States\" by Dr. Lisa Reyes Mason examines the intersection of environmental justice and social work, specifically focusing on how these domains play out across various practice settings. While the paper does not directly address urban green spaces, its findings highlight the broader context of environmental justice, which is linked to the enhancement of community well-being through equitable access to public resources, including green spaces. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The claim that \"Urban green spaces enhance community well-being\" is fundamentally supported by the discussions in the paper around environmental equity and the social benefits derived from just allocations of natural resources. Mason draws attention to the disparities faced by marginalized communities in accessing and enjoying environmental resources. This notion is critical because it suggests that green spaces are not just physical attributes of the urban environment but are essential components for fostering community health, well-being, and social cohesion. The paper emphasizes that when urban areas integrate green spaces, particularly in historically marginalized neighborhoods, they serve as conduits for positive community interaction and well-being. \n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: Mason's methodology includes qualitative analyses through interviews and case studies within three U.S. states, producing a rich narrative around environmental justice issues. The paper effectively integrates lived experiences with theoretical frameworks, which enhance the quality of evidence supporting the relevance of environmental justice to community well-being. However, the reliance on qualitative data limits the generalizability of the findings. The focus on specific practice settings may not account for the diversity of urban environments, though it does provide critical insights into how social work practice can contribute to enhancing green space accessibility, thereby supporting community wellness. \n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings of this study are significant as they illuminate how social work can advocate for policy changes favoring the integration of urban green spaces in the planning process, particularly in underserved areas. Mason underscores the role of social workers not only as advocates for vulnerable populations but also as key players in the push for environmental changes that directly impact community well-being. By aligning the goals of social justice with environmental action, the paper indicates that access to green spaces can be a critical factor in ameliorating various social and health inequities, ultimately contributing to a higher quality of life for community members. \n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: While the research provides valuable insights, several limitations exist. First, the focus on select U.S. states may introduce geographical biases that affect the applicability of findings in different contexts. Additionally, qualitative research is inherently subjective; thus, interpretations might vary based on the researchers' perspectives. Furthermore, while the data portray a strong tie between environmental justice and community well-being, the absence of a quantitative analysis leaves a gap in measuring the actual impact of green spaces on community psychological and physical health outcomes.  \nIn conclusion, Mason’s paper contributes to the broader understanding of how urban green spaces can be a significant element in fortifying community well-being through environmental justice frameworks. By advocating for equitable access and addressing systemic barriers, the study aligns with the claim that urban green spaces indeed enhance community well-being.",
