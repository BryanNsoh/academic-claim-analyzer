It maps a conversation \namong the authors that is intended to introduce core system dynamics concepts. The causal map \nis presented for illustrative purposes only. It will be refined over the course of the next several \nyears through a project recently funded by the USDA Forest Service titled, “Integrating the Grey \nand the Green to Improve Health and Well-Being for Urban Populations” (Research Joint \nVenture Agreement, #12-JV-11242309-095). \n \n \nThroughout the history of cities, a wide range of social actors has competed over urban land as a \nscarce resource (Svendsen 2009). Regrettably, grey infrastructure (e.g., streets and sewers) has \ntoo often been positioned as being at odds with green infrastructure (e.g., parks and open spaces), \ninstead of the two being conceived of as mutually beneficial (Svendsen 2011). While there is \nincreasing recognition that cities are ecosystems with interacting human, structural, and \necological components (McDonnell and Pickett 1993; Machlis et al. 1997; Vibrant Cities & \nUrban Forests Task Force 2011), to date it has been difficult to communicate regarding how the \ninvolved elements relate to one another, much less decide how best to intervene to obtain desired \noutcomes. The purpose of this paper is to use system dynamics to visualize and explore the \ncomplex and dynamic relationships between grey and green infrastructure, and the benefits of \ntheir integration on the health and well-being of urban populations. \n \nAs a vital component of green infrastructure in cities, community gardens are exceptional \nin their ability to address an array of public health and livability issues across the lifespan (Twiss \net al. 2003). While they began more than a hundred years ago at the turn of the twentieth century \n(Lawson 2005), they are especially important during times of war, economic crisis, and food \nshortages (Helphand 2006). For example, during the Great Depression, city lands were made \navailable to the unemployed and impoverished by the Work Projects Administration (WPA), \nwith nearly 5000 gardens on 700 acres cultivated in New York City alone (Hynes 1996 as cited \nin Armstrong 2000). Today, community gardens are viewed as beneficial to participants by \nproviding them with opportunities to be actively involved in decision-making about the \ndevelopment and use of urban space (Stone 2009). \n \nSYSTEMS SCIENCE \n \nA systems science approach may inform healthy cities and sustainable urban agriculture \ninitiatives by providing mechanisms for modeling complex, dynamic problems (Northridge and \nFreeman 2011; Metcalf and Widener 2011). In particular, system dynamics is concerned with the \nidentification and modeling of feedback relationships that characterize a particular problem, \nincluding inherent delays (Forrester 1961; Sterman 2000). By linking the structure of complex \nsystems to their behavior over time, system dynamics modeling helps interested parties and \ndecision makers assess the impact of different interventions in both the short-term and the long-\nterm (Metcalf et al. 2011). \n \nMoreover, because it is a methodology that is conducive to interdisciplinary work and an \ninherently iterative process, the construction of a system dynamics model provides an \nopportunity for input from a variety of stakeholders, which may be especially important in \n1\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nunderstanding the relationships between community gardens and human health and well-being. \nAfter jointly articulating the problem, a causal map is drawn to visualize feedback relationships \namong the relevant factors that shape system behavior over time (Metcalf et al. 2011). Such a \nrepresentation constitutes a dynamic hypothesis of plausible relationships that may be tested with \na formal computer model, often after undergoing significant revision through either a \nparticipatory or group modeling process (Metcalf et al. 2010; van den Belt, 2004). For \ncommunity groups and practitioners who lack the resources needed to quantify and calibrate a \nsimulation model, or who aim primarily to reflect group knowledge using visual iconography, \nthe construction of a causal map may be a worthwhile goal in and of itself (Ford 2009). The \nderived causal map then becomes a boundary object that facilitates team communication about \nproject scope and underlying assumptions (Star and Griesemer 1989), and may be utilized in \ncommunity visioning and strategic planning processes (Twiss et al. 2003).  \n \nAn orientation to the causal mapping process is called systems thinking (Senge 1990; \nMeadows 2008) or feedback thought (Richardson 1991), a necessary skill in system dynamics \nmodeling. In order to introduce key concepts, a systems perspective is employed in this article to \nframe the problem of community concern around the high prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nunderserved urban neighborhoods. \n \nCAUSAL DYNAMICS \n \nThe etiology of asthma is complex and multi-factorial, including both genetic and environmental \ninfluences (Brisbon et al. 2005). It is currently the most common chronic disease of childhood in \nthe United States and the primary reason for school absenteeism, and disproportionately burdens \nmany socioeconomically disadvantaged urban communities (Gold and Wright 2005). \nExplanations for this health inequity include poverty, variations in environmental exposures, and \ndifferential access to medical care; reducing the burden of asthma requires efforts to address the \nunderlying social justice conditions that produce this health inequity (Greenwood et al. 2011). \n \n The hypothesized causal dynamics involved in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods are mapped in Figure 1, with a focus on \ncommunity concern for asthma as a motivating factor for both grey and green infrastructure \ninterventions. \n \n2\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\n \nFigure 1. Causal dynamics of asthma \narrows indicate positive polarity. Dotted arrows indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. \nHatched arrows indicate a delay, or time lag, to allow for resulting shifts in behavior and activity.\n \nThe causal map in Figure 1 makes explicit features of conversations among the authors \nregarding the complex and dynamic relationships involved in the case of asthma. This causal \nmap was constructed by co-author Sara S. Metcalf and revised with feedback from the other \nauthors. Note that the causal map uses solid arrows to indicate positive polarity, and dotted \narrows to indicate negative polarity, or inverse relationships. Positive\nincrease in the cause results in an increase in the effect, whereas negative polarity indicates that \nan increase in the cause results in a decrease in the effect. These links combine to create a set of \nreinforcing and counteracting feedback loops, as discussed in the sections that follow. While \nmany of the transitions outlined in Figure 1 involve implicit delays, the hatched arrows from \n“community concern for asthma” to “mass transit improvement” and “local asthma clinics” \nsignify delays that are substantially longer than other delays in the system. Explicit recognition \nof these time lags is necessary to allow for resulting shifts in behaviors and activities. This causal \nmap is a representation of the authors' shared understanding\ngreen infrastructure on urban health issues such as asthma. As this modeling effort continues, \ncertain unintended consequences of proposed interventions may challenge these initial \nhypotheses and thus require further analys\n \nGREY INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS\n \nGrey infrastructure has been defined as conventional storage structures (reservoirs, detention \nponds) and conveyances (pipes, canals) used to manage drinking, sewer, or storm water, usually \nin socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods\n polarity signifies that an \n about the influence of grey and \nis. \n \n \n. Solid \n \n3\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\nconstructed of concrete or metal (Foster et al. 2011). It also includes streets, roads, bridges, and \nbuildings that do not incorporate technologies intended to achieve environmental goals (Foster et \nal. 2011). At the bottom of Figure 1 are two balancing or counteracting loops. For the sake of \nillustration, assume that mass transit improvements and local asthma clinics are part of the grey \ninfrastructure of a community, even as it may be possible to incorporate natural vegetation and \ninnovative grey materials such as permeable pavements and white roofs into these interventions \n(Foster et al. 2011). \n \nIn the outermost counteracting loop at the bottom right of the causal map, community \nconcern for asthma leads to the construction of local asthma clinics, but this takes time, as \nindicated by the hatched arrow. Once the local asthma clinics are operating, however, the \nprevalence of asthma symptoms is decreased, as depicted by the dotted arrow. In the absence of \neducation and outreach on the importance of its mitigation, a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms could lead to less community concern for asthma, as depicted in the causal map. In \nother words, prevalence increases concern, and lower prevalence ultimately lowers concern. This \nwould tend toward cycles of increasing prevalence and concern, followed by mitigated \nprevalence, diminished concern, disinvestment, and a potential resurgence of asthma prevalence. \nA useful comparison would be a campaign against secondhand smoke, a trigger for asthma \nsymptoms: although the prevalence of smoking has declined, the campaign against secondhand \nsmoke remains quite strong. Without a secondhand smoke campaign, concern about smoking \nmight diminish, and smoking prevalence may again increase.  \n \nA second counteracting loop is triggered by community concern for asthma leading to \nmass transit improvement, although again it may take time for funds to be allocated and \nconstruction to be completed, as per the hatched arrow designation. To the extent that mass \ntransit is then more efficient to use than automobiles, traffic volume will decrease, as indicated \nby the dotted arrow. Lower traffic volume means improved air quality due to lower levels of \nrespiratory irritant pollutants such as ground level ozone and respirable particulate matter \n(Brisbon et al. 2005), as signified by a dotted (inverse) arrow in the causal map. In turn, \nimproved air quality leads to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms, once again denoted by a \ndotted arrow. Over time, the counteracting loop is completed when a lower prevalence of asthma \nsymptoms eventually leads to less community concern for asthma, as before. In recognition of \nthis potential feedback mechanism, alternative interventions may be represented that would \nmitigate the diminishing of community concern for asthma as its prevalence declines. By \ndiagramming the underlying structure of these relationships, consequent behaviors and activities \nflowing from grey infrastructure investments may be explicitly articulated and constructively \ndebated. \n \nGREEN INFRASTRUCTURE DYNAMICS \n \nGreen infrastructure encompasses the naturally occurring and human-built features that manage \nstorm water, remove pollutants, conserve energy, reduce erosion, and provide other ecological, \ncost-effective, and environmentally sustainable services (Vibrant Cities & Urban Forests Task \nForce 2011). Community concern for asthma may motivate individual volunteers, civic groups, \nand philanthropic donors to create green spaces centered on plants and waterways, leading to the \ncultivation of community gardens (Svendsen 2011). The bottom left of Figure 1 depicts a \n4\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nreinforcing feedback loop whereby community concern for asthma leads to the creation of green \nspaces, which in turn leads to the cultivation of community gardens, resulting in a stronger sense \nof community, which leads to renewed community concern for asthma. Note that green \ninfrastructure interventions may be deployed more rapidly than mass transit improvements or the \nconstruction of asthma clinics (i.e., there are no hatched arrows leading into or out of the \ncommunity gardens element in the causal map). \n \n In addition, the cultivation of community gardens leads to more opportunities for \ngardening, and eventually to more members of the community being involved in gardening \n(Figure 1). On the right-hand side of the causal map, there are two additional reinforcing \nfeedback loops. In the outermost loop, gardening leads to shared experience among community \nmembers and a stronger sense of community, which again results in renewed community concern \nfor asthma. In the adjacent interior loop, gardening leads to enhanced gardening skills, then in \nturn to more opportunities for gardening. According to Twiss et al. (2003), gardening workshops \nprovide opportunities for community members of all ages to develop skills in leadership, \ncommunity organizing, cultural competency, and program planning, implementation, and \nevaluation; gardening skills are enhanced through experiential learning, which includes \nintergenerational and peer-to-peer mentoring and train-the-trainer models. Ongoing, interactive \nlearning opportunities help to sustain momentum for gardening, which is effectively \ncommunicated via the reinforcing feedback loop in the causal map. \n \nHEALTH AND WELL-BEING DYNAMICS \n \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Health is a state of complete physical, \nmental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” (see \nhttps://apps.who.int/aboutwho/en/definition.html) While social well-being is included in the \nWHO definition of health, well-being includes multiple dimensions and is measured in a variety \nof ways in the scientific literature. For individuals, well-being may be understood as positive \naffect, life satisfaction, or simply happiness. For communities, well-being may be thought of as \nlivability, or shared experiences. \n \n A central reinforcing loop in Figure 1 is formed by the positive and reflexive relationship \nbetween health and well-being. For instance, enhanced well-being may lead to lower blood \npressure and less hypertension, resulting in fewer cardiovascular events (Shirai et al. 2009). On \nthe other hand, good health may foster engagement in social activities, including community \ngardening, thereby improving individual and community well-being (Armstrong 2000). For \nillustrative purposes, two pathways leading from community gardens are depicted in the causal \nmap, which are consonant with the research interests of the involved authors. The first pathway \nleads to well-being through sacredness, an interpretive act of ‘setting aside’ space for community \nor personal use that intertwines the sacred and the profane, and may include rituals, ceremony, \nand pilgrimage (Svendsen and Campbell 2010). The second pathway leads to improved nutrition \nand better health through the availability of fresh local produce (Metcalf and Widener 2011). \nNote also at the top of the causal map that gardening leads to increased physical activity, which \nin turn leads to better health, in concert with both the existing literature and the lived experiences \nof gardeners (Armstrong 2000; Wakefield et al. 2007).  \n \n5\nSvendsen et al.: Integrating Grey and Green Infrastructure\nPublished by Digital Commons at Loyola Marymount University and Loyola Law School, 2012\n Systems dynamics modeling is also useful for understanding unanticipated effects. For \ninstance, while physical activity leads to enhanced health, it may also induce asthma symptoms \n(Parsons et al. 2011), as depicted in Figure 1. In general, though, better health leads to a lower \nprevalence of asthma symptoms, as denoted by the dotted arrow in the causal map. \n \nTeig et al. (2009) reported that the social organizational underpinnings of gardens give \nrise to a range of social processes, including social connectedness, reciprocity, mutual trust, \ncollective decision-making, civic engagement, and community building—all of which are part of \npathways leading to improved human health and well-being. Systems science modeling may be \nused to simulate social networks as well (Valente 2010), even as it will not be dealt with at \nlength in this article. \n \nWHOLE SYSTEMS \n \nAs exemplified by Figure 1, ongoing efforts to improve asthma in disadvantaged city \nneighborhoods may be meaningfully abetted by modeling that explicitly links grey and green \ninfrastructure. An integrative, complex systems perspective helps to identify interventions as \nleverage points that impact interconnected components and domains. Through the process of \narticulating causal relationships between elements, community members and social scientists \nengage in a participatory process of knowledge sharing to develop a joint sense of how resources \nought to be allocated to improve the health and well-being of urban populations and promote \nsocial justice and health equity. As illustrated in the causal map, two counteracting loops are \ninduced with grey infrastructure interventions (mass transit improvements and establishment of \nlocal asthma clinics), which also incur meaningful investment and inherent delays.  \n \nOn the other hand, the causal map is valuable in identifying a series of reinforcing loops \nthat is induced with green infrastructure interventions. In other words, planting a community \ngarden may not be the most direct response to addressing the prevalence of asthma symptoms in \ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, even as it leads to the availability of fresh produce and improved \nnutrition and engenders a sense of community and sacredness, which are linked in turn to health \nand well-being. \n \nWhile virtuous cycles were emphasized earlier in this article related to the preservation of \ngreen spaces and the creation of community gardens, they might become vicious cycles if \nenvironmentally sustainable city planning is not enforced, economic policies fail to consider the \nshort-term and long-term benefits of urban forests, and incentives that curtailBris sprawl and \nencourage biodiversity are not enacted (Brown and Jameton 2000). The reinforcing nature of the \nfeedback loops indicates their capacity to destabilize the ecosystem. To counter this tendency, a \nsystems perspective underscores the value of coordinated interventions that integrate grey and \ngreen infrastructure, to guide decisions that provide urban populations with environmental, \neconomic, social, and health benefits, and build resilience in social-ecological systems (Olsson et \nal. 2004). \n \n \n \n \n6\nCities and the Environment (CATE), Vol. 5 [2012], Iss. 1, Art. 3\nhttp://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cate/vol5/iss1/3\nLITERATURE CITED \n \nArmstrong, D.

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig. Yes N(%) No N(%) Don’t know N(%) Practicing daily social interaction in the pocket parks and nearby open spaces Yes (N) 41 (13.4%) 3 (0.9%) 1 (0.3%) 45 (14.7%) 0.000** No (N) 17 (5.5%) 226 (73.8%) 7 (2.2%) 250 (81.7%)  Don’t know (N) 1 (0.3%) 5 (1.6%) 3 (0.9%) 9 (2.9%)   Total 59 (19.3%) 234 (76.4%) 11 (3.6%) 304 (99.3%)  *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01 using ANOVA Test  One-way ANOVA test used to test the association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor (dependent variable) and the availability of efficient small (pocket) parks in the neighborhoods where respondents lived (independent variable). One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.

ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

As urban populations continue to grow, the deficiency of parks and recreational areas adversely affects public health, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. The program aims to convert underutilized rooftops into vibrant green spaces, providing urban dwellers with new venues for relaxation, physical activity, and social interaction. The primary objective is to enhance physical and mental health outcomes for urban residents by increasing their access to green spaces through the creation of rooftop parks and gardens.\n\n\nThe program's methodology includes conducting a comprehensive needs assessment, constructing and establishing rooftop parks, engaging the community through awareness campaigns, and offering educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The success of the program will be measured using a robust evaluation framework with specific outcome and output indicators. Key outcome indicators include a 20% reduction in self-reported stress levels among residents living near the rooftop parks and a measurable decrease in urban heat island temperatures. Output indicators focus on the number of rooftop parks established, the level of community engagement, and participation rates in educational activities.\n\n\nTo ensure effective implementation, the program has developed a detailed plan encompassing architectural designs, community engagement strategies, and sustainable maintenance practices. Risk mitigation measures include seeking diverse funding sources, ensuring regulatory compliance, and employing flexible construction timelines to address potential delays. Community involvement is a cornerstone of the program, with organized events and workshops designed to foster a sense of ownership and ongoing support for the rooftop parks.\n\n\nThe Rooftop Parks and Gardens program offers a holistic solution to improving urban health and well-being. By transforming rooftops into green spaces, the program seeks to create more resilient, sustainable, and inclusive urban environments, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for all residents.Master of Public Healt",

The scarcity of parks and natural environments in densely populated cities contributes to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and diminished well-being. Our project proposes developing rooftop parks and gardens to address these issues, transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. The project begins by identifying suitable rooftops for park and garden development. This involves assessing structural integrity, accessibility, and potential community needs. Once appropriate sites are identified, the project moves into the design and construction phase, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The resulting rooftop parks will provide relaxation, recreation, and social interaction spaces.  Community engagement is a critical component of this project. By involving residents from the outset, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and ensure that the rooftop parks meet the community's specific needs. Activities include: • Training local volunteers to maintain the green spaces. • Organizing events to promote awareness. • Creating community-led groups to manage the parks' ongoing maintenance. The benefits of rooftop parks are significant. These green spaces offer urban residents a much-needed escape from city life, providing areas for exercise, relaxation, and social gatherings. The project also seeks to raise awareness about environmental sustainability by integrating educational programs and community activities that promote eco-friendly practices.  The community-driven approach fosters social cohesion and resilience, encouraging collaboration among residents. By involving the community in every project stage, from planning to maintenance, we aim to create a long-lasting impact on urban health and well-being.  Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the quality of life for urban residents, strengthen community ties, and contribute to creating more resilient and sustainable cities. By providing accessible green spaces in urban settings, this project represents a crucial step in addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and its impact on public health and community well-being.    2  SECTION 3: DETAILED PROJECT INFORMATION  1. Problem Statement:  Urban environments often suffer from a significant lack of accessible green spaces, leading to numerous health risks and exacerbating broader humanitarian issues. This scarcity contributes to physical health concerns such as heat-related illnesses, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, it triggers a rise in mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and social isolation (Geary et al., 2023). The limited availability of green spaces restricts opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, which are essential for the well-being of urban residents. The broader impact of this problem extends beyond individual health, affecting community resilience and environmental sustainability. Green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating environmental risks, such as air pollution and the urban heat island effect. They also offer a natural refuge from the stresses of urban life, providing a setting where residents can engage in outdoor activities or simply unwind from the pressures of city living. Despite their importance, millions of people in densely populated cities worldwide face limited access to parks and other green areas, impacting their quality of life and contributing to social inequalities. Research in reputable journals like The Lancet and Environmental Health Perspectives has established a strong link between green spaces and reduced rates of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and various mental health disorders (Rojas-Rueda et al. , 2016). Green spaces can also positively influence children's cognitive development and improve the overall quality of urban environments. Furthermore, global initiatives like the World Health Organization's Urban Green Spaces and Health program emphasize the role of green spaces in promoting public health and environmental quality (World Health Organization,2016). The lack of accessible green spaces also has significant social implications. The unequal distribution of parks and recreational areas often leaves marginalized communities without access to these vital resources, reinforcing existing social disparities. This unequal access undermines environmental sustainability, as green spaces are critical for regulating temperatures, reducing pollution, and promoting biodiversity. The absence of green spaces diminishes environmental quality and increases cities' vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Moreover, the lack of green spaces contributes to increased social isolation, particularly among older adults and children. This issue disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where access to green spaces is often more limited. The result is a cycle of health, social, and environmental inequity that perpetuates itself over time. Addressing the shortage of green spaces in urban areas is crucial for promoting social justice, human rights, and sustainable development. It aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to health, sustainable cities, and climate action. A community-based approach to developing and preserving green spaces can contribute to social cohesion and strengthen urban resilience. It can also create new economic opportunities through community-led initiatives and support efforts to tackle climate change. By prioritizing equitable access to green spaces, cities can foster a sense of community and improve public health outcomes. Addressing this shortage allows for greater inclusivity, ensuring that all residents can 3  benefit from nature's physical, mental, and social advantages within urban settings. Ultimately, green spaces should be viewed not just as amenities but as essential components of a healthy and sustainable urban infrastructure. Addressing this issue holistically not only improves individual health outcomes but also builds stronger, more inclusive communities capable of withstanding socio-economic and environmental stressors.    2. Description of the Solution:  Rooftop parks and gardens offer an innovative solution to the growing problem of limited green spaces in urban areas. As cities become increasingly crowded, these green areas effectively use underutilized rooftop spaces, providing accessible nature and recreational areas within dense urban landscapes. This approach addresses several critical issues simultaneously, fostering environmental sustainability, enhancing social cohesion, and stimulating economic growth. The concept of rooftop parks and gardens is rooted in the efficient use of existing infrastructure, a critical consideration in cities where available land is scarce and development pressures are high. By repurposing rooftops, we can create green spaces that serve multiple functions, from improving air quality to providing community gathering spaces. This innovative approach reduces the need to acquire additional land for green spaces, allowing cities to maintain their density while offering residents much-needed areas for recreation and relaxation.  Environmental Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens contribute significantly to environmental sustainability. These green spaces act as \"green lungs\" within the concrete jungle, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They also help mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing natural cooling, which is crucial as global temperatures rise and cities become warmer. Rooftop greenery can reduce energy consumption by providing natural insulation, leading to lower heating and cooling costs for buildings. This, in turn, can reduce the overall carbon footprint of urban areas.  Additionally, rooftop parks and gardens contribute to improved water management in cities. They can act as natural rainwater catchment systems, reducing runoff and easing pressure on urban drainage systems. This helps to prevent flooding and promotes groundwater recharge, contributing to a more sustainable urban water cycle. Rooftop gardens can also support biodiversity by providing birds, insects, and other wildlife habitats in an otherwise sterile urban environment. This biodiversity aspect is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems within cities.  Social Benefits Beyond environmental sustainability, rooftop parks and gardens offer significant social benefits. Studies have shown that access to green spaces can improve mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. These spaces provide a respite from the noise and congestion of urban life, allowing residents to relax and connect with nature. Rooftop parks and gardens also serve as communal gathering spots, fostering social interaction and strengthening community bonds. These green spaces are precious in cities where social isolation is a growing concern. By creating environments that encourage people to come together, rooftop parks and gardens can help combat loneliness and promote a sense of belonging. They can also promote physical activity, as they offer spaces for exercise and recreation. This is particularly important in urban areas where traditional parks and open spaces are inaccessible. 4   Furthermore, rooftop parks and gardens can help bridge social divides by providing inclusive spaces where people from diverse backgrounds can meet and interact. This can foster greater understanding and tolerance among different groups, creating a more cohesive and harmonious urban community.  Economic Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens also offer significant economic benefits. They can enhance property values, making them an attractive feature for real estate development. A study by the National Association of Realtors found that proximity to parks and green spaces can increase property values by up to 20%. This increase in property values can increase cities' tax revenue, providing additional funding for public services and infrastructure.  Moreover, rooftop parks and gardens can create employment opportunities in construction and ongoing maintenance. This can stimulate local economies and provide landscaping, gardening, and park management jobs. These employment opportunities can be particularly beneficial in urban areas with high unemployment rates, offering a pathway for economic development and revitalization. Rooftop parks and gardens can also support local businesses by attracting visitors and encouraging foot traffic in urban areas. These green spaces can become popular destinations, drawing people from across the city and creating opportunities for retail and service businesses nearby. This can lead to a more vibrant urban economy and a higher quality of life for residents.  Theory of Change The theory of change underlying the adoption of rooftop parks and gardens revolves around their capacity to catalyze positive transformations across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By converting rooftops into green spaces, we can anticipate tangible improvements in air quality, urban heat island mitigation, and biodiversity conservation, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals.  Socially, these spaces can foster community cohesion, promote physical and mental well-being, and provide inclusive areas for recreational activities and social interaction. The sense of community that rooftop parks and gardens foster can strengthen urban resilience and support efforts to build more inclusive and equitable cities.  Rooftop parks and gardens offer a holistic solution to the problem of limited green spaces in urban areas by addressing environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and economic development. This innovative approach can lead to more resilient, inclusive, and livable cities that prioritize the well-being of their residents while promoting sustainable development goals.            5  3. Program Design and Implementation Plan:  The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program is a comprehensive initiative to enhance public health and well-being in urban areas by transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. This program addresses the growing issue of limited green spaces in cities, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. The overarching goal is to improve physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents by constructing rooftop parks, engaging communities through awareness programs, and providing educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The first step in implementing this program involves conducting a thorough needs assessment to identify rooftops suitable for development. This step includes extensive surveys and consultations with property owners, local authorities, and community stakeholders to ensure that the rooftops meet structural and safety requirements. The needs assessment also gauges community support and confirms regulatory compliance. By selecting appropriate rooftops, the program provides its efforts to align with local building codes and address potential risks. Once the suitable rooftops are identified, the program moves into the design and planning phase, which involves creating detailed architectural and landscaping blueprints. This phase emphasizes safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. Collaborating with urban planners and landscape architects, the designs incorporate elements that support the program's goals while enhancing the visual appeal of the urban landscape. Following the design phase, the construction of the rooftop parks and gardens begins. This step involves preparing the rooftops, installing safety features, and constructing green spaces according to the approved plans. The program establishes clear timelines and milestones for construction, allowing for efficient project management. To ensure the longevity of the rooftop parks, a comprehensive maintenance plan is developed, involving community volunteers and local organizations to maintain the green spaces. Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the program's success. The program organizes various events and awareness campaigns to encourage community participation and foster a sense of ownership. Volunteer opportunities are created for the upkeep of the rooftop parks, and educational workshops on gardening and environmental practices are offered to promote sustainable behavior. This community-focused approach helps integrate the rooftop parks into the urban culture, turning them into valued assets. To mitigate potential problems, the program implements several vital strategies. Diverse funding sources are secured to ensure financial stability, while close collaboration with local authorities helps navigate regulatory challenges. The program also uses weather-resistant materials and adjusts construction timelines to accommodate adverse weather conditions. Extensive community outreach and education efforts are made to reduce resistance and build strong support for the program. Robust evaluation metrics are established to monitor the program's progress and success. These include indicators such as reported stress levels, surface temperatures, and the number of completed rooftop projects. These metrics provide a clear framework for assessing the program's impact and allow for timely adjustments to address any challenges during implementation. The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program aims to significantly improve public health and well-being in urban areas through a well-thought-out program design and a comprehensive implementation plan. By engaging the community 6  and addressing potential risks, the program creates sustainable and accessible green spaces that contribute to the overall resilience and quality of life in urban environments.

Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people.Maintaining functional and biodiverse urban green spaces is fundamental for liveable cities (cf. SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20.

Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2.

Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

Armed with this knowledge, urban planners can then delve deeper into understanding the intricate relationship between the built environment and health, thereby laying the groundwork for informed decision-making processes. This data-driven approach empowers city officials and policymakers to design urban landscapes that prioritize the well-being of their citizens, ensuring that public spaces, transportation systems, and housing developments are conducive to fostering healthier lifestyles.[39], [40] The implementation of smart technologies in urban environments holds tremendous potential for improving public health. Wearable devices, for instance, have become increasingly popular as tools for promoting individual health awareness. These cutting-edge gadgets, ranging from fitness trackers to smartwatches, empower individuals to monitor and manage their personal health data, fostering a sense of responsibility and proactivity. By harnessing the power of these devices, cities can encourage their residents to take charge of their own well-being and engage in healthier behaviors. The data generated by wearable devices can also be aggregated and anonymized to gain insights at a population level, enabling city officials to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas of intervention.In addition to wearable devices, the integration of health monitoring systems in urban environments represents another exciting avenue for targeted interventions. These systems, often leveraging advanced sensors and real-time data analysis, enable cities to proactively monitor the health of their residents and swiftly respond to emerging health challenges. For instance, air quality sensors placed strategically throughout the city can provide real-time updates on pollution levels, allowing officials to take prompt action to mitigate the negative impact on public health. Similarly, by integrating health monitoring systems into public spaces, cities can create a supportive environment that encourages healthy behaviors and provides immediate feedback to individuals, thus fostering a culture of well-being[41], [42], [43]  The seamless integration of data and technology in urban planning and public health not only facilitates evidence-based decision-making but also enhances collaboration   RCBA-2022 Volume 5, Issue 1   P a g e  | 38                and information sharing across various sectors. The availability of comprehensive health data empowers city officials, urban planners, healthcare professionals, and community organizations to work collaboratively towards common goals. By leveraging shared data and insights, these stakeholders can pool their expertise, resources, and knowledge to develop innovative solutions that address the unique health challenges of their urban communities. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, cities can develop comprehensive strategies that go beyond traditional approaches and deliver meaningful, sustainable improvements in public health outcomes.[44] [45] [46]  Evaluation and Monitoring  Evaluation and monitoring play a crucial role in urban planning, as they enable the continuous assessment and appraisal of the impact that planning decisions have on public health outcomes. To effectively evaluate these impacts, it is essential to collect and analyze data on various health indicators, including but not limited to physical activity levels, air quality, and access to healthcare services. By gathering such data, urban planners can gain insights into the effectiveness of implemented interventions and identify areas that require further improvement.This information serves as a valuable resource to inform future planning efforts, enabling planners to make evidence-based decisions that prioritize public health and well-being.[47] [48]  One of the key aspects of evaluation and monitoring in urban planning is the collection of data on physical activity levels. By tracking and analyzing data related to physical activity, planners can gauge the effectiveness of their interventions in promoting active lifestyles within urban environments. Longitudinal studies and surveys can help identify trends and patterns in physical activity behavior, shedding light on areas where interventions have been successful and areas that require targeted attention. Such data can be utilized to create evidence-based policies and interventions that prioritize pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, promote active transportation options, and encourage the creation of accessible recreational spaces.Another critical area of evaluation and monitoring in urban planning is the assessment of air quality. With increasing urbanization and industrialization, air pollution has emerged as a significant public health concern. Collecting data on air quality indicators, such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide levels, and ozone concentrations, allows planners to evaluate the impact of urban planning decisions on air pollution levels. This data-driven approach helps identify hotspots with poor air quality and guides the development of strategies to mitigate pollution, such as the implementation of green infrastructure, promotion of electric transportation, and enforcement of emission standards. By continuously monitoring air quality, planners can gauge the effectiveness of these measures and refine their strategies accordingly.[49] [50] [51]    RCBA-2022 Volume 5, Issue 1   P a g e  | 39                Evaluating access to healthcare services is a crucial aspect of monitoring public health outcomes in urban planning. By examining data on healthcare accessibility, including the availability of medical facilities, proximity to healthcare providers, and healthcare utilization rates, planners can assess the extent to which communities have access to essential health services. Disparities in access can be identified, and interventions can be designed to address these gaps, such as the establishment of healthcare clinics in underserved areas or the improvement of public transportation routes to facilitate access to healthcare facilities. Regular monitoring and evaluation of healthcare access help ensure that urban planning decisions align with the goal of equitable health outcomes for all residents. [52]  [53], [54] The information gathered through evaluation and monitoring processes serves not only to assess the effectiveness of interventions but also to inform future planning efforts. By analyzing data on health indicators and their relationship with planning decisions, urban planners can identify successful strategies and best practices that can be replicated in other areas. Moreover, the identification of areas for improvement based on evaluation findings enables planners to focus their efforts on addressing specific challenges and developing targeted interventions. This data-driven approach empowers planners to make evidence-based decisions, adapt policies to changing circumstances, and optimize urban planning processes to promote better public health outcomes in the future.[55], [56]  Conclusion Integrating urban public health considerations into urban planning is crucial for the creation of smart cities that prioritize the well-being and health of their citizens. By adopting a comprehensive approach that encompasses various aspects of urban design, pollution control, healthcare accessibility, transportation safety, noise pollution management, mental health promotion, data and technology integration, and evaluation and monitoring, cities can address the challenges posed by urbanization and create environments that promote physical and mental well-being. Healthy urban design plays a crucial role in creating livable and sustainable cities. By prioritizing physical activity, accessibility, and safety, urban spaces can be transformed into vibrant, inclusive, and healthy environments. The integration of walkable neighborhoods, parks, green spaces, and recreational facilities encourages active transportation and provides opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities. Inclusivity and accessibility are key considerations, ensuring that public spaces are designed to accommodate individuals of all abilities. Additionally, reducing pollution and noise levels contributes to the overall well-being of residents. Through thoughtful and intentional urban planning, cities can foster healthier lifestyles, promote mental well-being, and enhance the quality of life for their residents. Mitigating air pollution and ensuring effective pollution control are critical for protecting public health and the environment. The implementation of comprehensive   RCBA-2022 Volume 5, Issue 1   P a g e  | 40                policies prioritizing emission reduction and clean energy adoption is essential in curbing the detrimental impact of pollutants on our atmosphere. Thoughtful urban planning that minimizes exposure to pollution sources, along with the incorporation of green spaces and urban forests, plays a crucial role in mitigating the harmful effects of air pollution in urban environments. Leveraging smart technologies for monitoring air quality and implementing targeted interventions enhances the efficiency and sustainability of pollution control measures. By taking these measures, we can create healthier, more sustainable, and livable environments for present and future generations.Accessible healthcare and services are fundamental for ensuring the well-being of individuals and communities. Equitable access to healthcare facilities and providers should be a priority, considering the specific needs of vulnerable populations throughout the planning process. Strategic location of healthcare services can bridge geographical gaps and address disparities in healthcare provision between urban and underserved areas. The integration of telemedicine and digital health solutions offers innovative ways to enhance access to healthcare services, particularly for those in remote or disadvantaged regions. By embracing these measures, we can foster a more inclusive healthcare system where everyone has equal opportunities to receive the care they need.   Prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety in urban planning is essential for creating safe and sustainable cities. This can be achieved by investing in pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, including well-designed crosswalks, traffic calming measures, and adequate lighting systems. Moreover, the development of dedicated cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes and secure bike parking, can encourage more people to choose active transportation options. Implementing effective traffic management strategies, such as appropriate speed limits and traffic calming measures, further improves road safety. Lastly, the integration of smart traffic systems brings intelligence and real-time responsiveness to the management of road networks, enhancing safety for all road users. By taking these comprehensive measures, we can create cities that prioritize active transportation while ensuring the well-being and safety of pedestrians and cyclists.Prioritizing mental health and social well-being in urban planning is essential for creating inclusive, connected, and thriving communities. By incorporating elements such as communal spaces, accessible resources, and diverse recreational opportunities, urban planners can foster social interaction, a sense of belonging, and the development of strong support networks. Thoughtful design choices that encourage socialization, relaxation, and recreation contribute to the overall well-being of individuals. The provision of community centers, cultural facilities, and social services within urban areas serves as crucial support systems, offering vital resources for mental health and community engagement. Inclusivity, equity, and community engagement are integral to successful urban planning, ensuring that diverse populations have equal access to resources and that the resulting environments meet their specific needs. A multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between various professionals,   RCBA-2022 Volume 5, Issue 1   P a g e  | 41                further enhances the design process by incorporating insights from psychology, social work, and architecture. By integrating mental health and social well-being into urban planning, we can create cities that promote the mental well-being and social cohesion of their residents, ultimately enhancing their overall quality of life. The utilization of data and technology integration in urban planning has the potential to revolutionize public health outcomes. By collecting and analyzing health-related data, cities can identify health disparities, understand the impact of the built environment, and inform decision-making processes. Smart technologies, such as wearable devices and health monitoring systems, offer avenues for promoting individual health awareness and facilitating targeted interventions. By embracing these innovations, cities can create healthier environments that empower their residents to take control of their well-being. Moreover, the seamless integration of data and technology encourages collaboration and information sharing among stakeholders, fostering interdisciplinary partnerships that lead to innovative solutions and improved public health outcomes for urban communities.Evaluation and monitoring are integral components of urban planning when it comes to promoting public health. Collecting and analyzing data on health indicators, such as physical activity levels, air quality, and access to healthcare, allows planners to assess the impact of their decisions and interventions. This information not only helps identify successful strategies but also reveals areas that require improvement. By utilizing these findings, urban planners can refine their approaches, develop evidence-based policies, and ensure that future planning efforts prioritize the well-being of residents. Through continuous evaluation and monitoring, urban planning can evolve to create healthier, more sustainable, and equitable cities for all.      [1] D. Adlakha and F.

They can address a variety of societal challenges in sustainable ways, with the potential to contribute to green growth, 'future-proofing' society, fostering citizen well-being, providing business opportunities and positioning Europe as a leader in world markets. \\u2028\n\n2.\tNature-based solutions are actions which are inspired by, supported by or copied from nature. They have tremendous potential to be energy and resource-efficient and resilient to change, but to be successful they must be adapted to local conditions. \\u2028\n\n3.\tMany nature-based solutions result in multiple co-benefits for health, the economy, society and the environment, and thus they can represent more efficient and cost-effective solutions than more traditional approaches. \\u2028\n\n4.\tAn EU Research & Innovation (R&I) agenda on nature-based solutions will enable Europe to become a world leader both in R&I and in the growing market for nature-based solutions. For this, the evidence base for the effectiveness of nature-based solutions needs to be developed and then used to implement solutions. Both need to be done in conjunction with stakeholders. The potential for transferability and upscaling of solutions also requires further investigation. There is also a need to develop a systemic approach that combines technical, business, finance, governance, regulatory and social innovation. \\u2028\n\n5.\tFour principal goals have been identified that can be addressed by nature-based solutions: \n\n\t\t��  Enhancing sustainable urbanisation through nature-based solutions can stimulate economic growth as well as improving the environment, making cities more attractive, and enhancing human well-being. \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Restoring degraded ecosystems using nature-based solutions can improve the resilience of ecosystems, enabling them to deliver vital ecosystem services and also to meet other societal challenges. \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Developing climate change adaptation and mitigation using nature-based solutions can provide more resilient responses and enhance the storage of carbon. \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Improving risk management and resilience using nature-based solutions can lead to greater benefits than conventional methods and offer synergies in reducing multiple risks. \\u2028\n\n6.\tBased on the four goals, seven nature-based solutions for R&I actions are recommended to be taken forward by the European Commission and Member States: \n\n\t\t��  Urban regeneration through nature-based solutions \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Nature-based solutions for improving well-being in urban areas \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Establishing nature-based solutions for coastal resilience \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Multi-functional nature-based watershed management and ecosystem restoration \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Nature-based solutions for increasing the sustainability of the use of matter and energy \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Nature-based solutions for enhancing the insurance value of ecosystems \\u2028\n\n\t\t��  Increasing carbon sequestration through nature-based solutions \\u2028This report was produced by the Horizon 2020 Expert Group on 'Nature-Based Solutions and Re- Naturing Cities', informed by the findings of an e-consultation and a stakeholder workshop. \\u202",

Nature-based solutions harness the power and sophistication of nature to turn environmental, \nsocial and economic challenges into innovation opportunities. They can address a variety of \nsocietal challenges in sustainable ways, with the potential to contribute to green growth, \n'future-proofing' society, fostering citizen well-being, providing business opportunities and \npositioning Europe as a leader in world markets. \n2. Nature-based solutions are actions which are inspired by, supported by or copied from nature. \nThey have tremendous potential to be energy and resource-efficient and resilient to change, but \nto be successful they must be adapted to local conditions.  \n3. Many nature-based solutions result in multiple co-benefits for health, the economy, society and \nthe environment, and thus they can represent more efficient and cost-effective solutions than \nmore traditional approaches.  \n4. An EU Research & Innovation (R&I) agenda on nature-based solutions will enable Europe to \nbecome a world leader both in R&I and in the growing market for nature-based solutions. For \nthis, the evidence base for the effectiveness of nature-based solutions needs to be developed \nand then used to implement solutions. Both need to be done in conjunction with stakeholders. \nThe potential for transferability and upscaling of solutions also requires further investigation. \nThere is also a need to develop a systemic approach that combines technical, business, finance, \ngovernance, regulatory and social innovation.  \n5. Four principal goals have been identified that can be addressed by nature-based solutions:  \n\u0010 Enhancing sustainable urbanisation through nature-based solutions can stimulate \neconomic growth as well as improving the environment, making cities more attractive, and \nenhancing human well-being.  \n\u0010 Restoring degraded ecosystems using nature-based solutions can improve the \nresilience of ecosystems, enabling them to deliver vital ecosystem services and also to \nmeet other societal challenges. \n\u0010 Developing climate change adaptation and mitigation using nature-based solutions \ncan provide more resilient responses and enhance the storage of carbon. \n\u0010 Improving risk management and resilience using nature-based solutions can lead to \ngreater benefits than conventional methods and offer synergies in reducing multiple risks. \n6. Based on the four goals, seven nature-based solutions for R&I actions are recommended to be \ntaken forward by the European Commission and Member States: \n\u0010 Urban regeneration through nature-based solutions  \n\u0010 Nature-based solutions for improving well-being in urban areas \n\u0010 Establishing nature-based solutions for coastal resilience  \n\u0010 Multi-functional nature-based watershed management and ecosystem restoration  \n\u0010 Nature-based solutions for increasing the sustainability of the use of matter and energy \n\u0010 Nature-based solutions for enhancing the insurance value of ecosystems  \n\u0010 Increasing carbon sequestration through nature-based solutions  \nThis report was produced by the Horizon 2020 Expert Group on 'Nature-Based Solutions and Re-\nNaturing Cities', informed by the findings of an e-consultation and a stakeholder workshop. \n 5 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAn EU R&I agenda on nature-based solutions is an essential component to greening the economy \nand achieving sustainable development. To contribute to the development of this R&I agenda, the \nExpert Group on 'Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities' was commissioned. Since the \nnature-based solutions concept is relatively new, the Expert Group developed an appropriate \ndefinition, before considering the opportunities for nature-based solutions.  \nNature-based solutions – what are they?1 \nNature-based solutions aim to help societies address a variety of environmental, social and \neconomic challenges in sustainable ways. They are actions which are inspired by, supported by or \ncopied from nature. Some involve using and enhancing existing natural solutions to challenges, \nwhile others are exploring more novel solutions, for example mimicking how non-human organisms \nand communities cope with environmental extremes. Nature-based solutions use the features and \ncomplex system processes of nature, such as its ability to store carbon and regulate water flow, in \norder to achieve desired outcomes, such as reduced disaster risk, improved human well-being and \nsocially inclusive green growth. Maintaining and enhancing natural capital, therefore, is of crucial \nimportance, as it forms the basis for implementing solutions. These nature-based solutions ideally \nare energy and resource-efficient, and resilient to change, but to be successful they must be \nadapted to local conditions.  \nNature-based solutions – why now? \nSeizing the momentum for change: We are living in a time of great opportunities for \naddressing societal challenges, such as increased urbanisation, economic inequalities and climate \nchange, and for ensuring our society is protected from foreseeable future changes. After much \ninvestment in studies of how nature works and how it benefits all people, we can now use this \nknowledge to turn these challenges into actions for sustainable and green growth. Nature-based \nsolutions involve innovative governance, institutional, business, and finance models and \nframeworks, leveraging both public and private funding. They also involve working beyond 'silos' \nand engaging with others across disciplines and sectors, as well as systemically involving all \nstakeholders, including citizens. All of these ideas are largely becoming recognised. \nA growing awareness of the value of nature: There is a growing interest and awareness within \nthe business community2 of the value of managing and maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem \nservices, as a business opportunity and as an essential means to reduce economic risks by \nensuring the continued supply of vital resources. The burgeoning number of international3, \nnational4, regional and local5 policy initiatives for the conservation and sustainable use of the \nnatural environment are evidence of the realisation by policy makers of the importance of nature \nto society. Civil society also is increasingly recognising the benefits derived from nature for \nenhancing well-being, as seen in the numerous bottom-up initiatives, particularly in community \nefforts to bring nature back into urban areas. Finally, the science and research community is \ncurrently focusing on 'people and nature', generating knowledge for resilient and adaptable socio-\necological systems.  \nBusiness has an opportunity: Infrastructure spending amounts to about 3.8% of global GDP, \nequivalent to US$2.6 trillion in 2013, and could grow to US$3.4 trillion per year through 20306. In \na time of fiscal austerity, cost-effectiveness has become critical. As a result governments are \ninterested in identifying cost-effective alternatives to grey or technology-based infrastructure to \ntackle challenges arising from biodiversity loss, climate change, more frequent natural disasters \nand rapid urbanisation. Nature-based solutions have demonstrated financial advantages due to a \n                                                 \n1 See Annex 1 for a more elaborated definition \n2 e.g. World Business Council for Sustainable Development, The Natural Capital Coalition \n3 e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction \n4 e.g. UK Natural Environment White Paper (2010) Government’s aim to be the “first generation to leave the \nnatural environment in a better state than it inherited” \n5 e.g. Freiburg Green City \n6 WBCSD (2015) http://action2020.org/business-solutions/investing-in-natural-infrastructure \n 6 \n \nreduction in initial capital expenses and on-going operational expenses and they have been used \nstrategically to recapitalise ageing resources. For example, the City of Philadelphia found that the \nnet present value of green infrastructure for storm-water control ranged from $1.94 to $4.45 \nbillion, while grey infrastructure benefits ranged from only $0.06 to $0.14 billion over a 40-year \nperiod7. Nature-based solutions also offer more opportunities than 'grey' infrastructure, as they not \nonly increase the resilience of society to external economic and environmental stresses, but \ncontribute positively to human health and well-being. These components are essential for \nsustainable competitiveness. \nEurope as an inspiration and world leader in markets: Although significant questions and \nknowledge gaps remain, Europe has extensive pools of knowledge, scientific expertise, skills and \ntechnological capability relevant to nature-based solutions. Local examples abound. What is \nneeded is to enhance the evidence-base and rationale and to implement nature-based solutions at \na greater speed and a wider scale. The aim of the EU R&I policy on nature-based solutions is to \nposition Europe as the world leader, both in R&I on nature-based solutions and in the global \nmarket for nature-based solutions. This will be done by developing, demonstrating and replicating \ninnovative nature-based solutions and establishing a European evidence base (Annex 3) to support \ntheir market deployment, as well as exploring new governance, institutional, business and finance \nmodels which leverage both public and private funding. It also seeks to set the scene for their \napplication in other EU policy areas, but also by Member States, business and civil society. \nThe EU R&I agenda on “nature-based solutions” is focused on new and innovative nature-based \nsolutions to societal challenges, but also builds on and supports other closely related concepts and \npolicies, such as the ecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem-based adaptation and \nmitigation, and natural, green and blue infrastructure.  \n                                                 \n7 Stratus Consulting (2009) A Triple Bottom Line Assessment of Traditional and Green Infrastructure Options \nfor Controlling CSO Events in Philadelphia’s Watersheds (Stratus Consulting, Boulder). \n 7 \n \n \n 8 \n \nKEY OPPORTUNITY AREAS FOR RESEARCH AND INNOVATION \nPOLICY ON NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS \nThe expert group identified four goals that offer exciting opportunities for promoting systemic and \nsustainable nature-based solutions, which will help Europe to achieve its aim of being a world \nleader in responsible innovation, while meeting the needs of society. The four goals are: enhancing \nsustainable urbanisation, restoring degraded ecosystems, developing climate change adaptation \nand mitigation and improving risk management and resilience8. The recommendations are not just \nfor the EU, but also for application at the national and sub-national levels.  \nGoal 1: Enhancing Sustainable Urbanisation (Annex 2a) \nCurrently, 73% of Europe’s population live in cities and this is projected to increase to 82% by \n2050, resulting in over 36 million new urban citizens9. This will pose a range of challenges for \ncities, including resource availability and equitable economic growth. The quality of urban \nenvironments is also at risk, necessitating their sustainable development and regeneration in order \nto provide citizens with healthy and liveable conditions. This also represents a business \nopportunity, for all actors that will need to be engaged with, in meeting the extensive demands for \nnew construction and renovation of housing, infrastructure, and other facilities.  \nNature-based solutions for sustainable urbanisation rely in large part on natural areas and features \nin and around cities to perform essential ecosystem services. They provide multiple strategic \nopportunity areas, which can be categorised under three main interconnected challenges and \ntrends. Firstly, nature-based solutions support economic development in urban areas, which is \nhighly dependent on the amount and quality of natural resources available, such as water for \nsanitation, drinking and manufacturing. The sustainability concerns in cities could drive the \nemergence of new business models, which decouple economic growth from resource depletion and \nthe uneven distribution of resources. This would build on the circular economy and increased \nreliance on local resources, leading to greater efficiency in the use of energy and materials. In \naddition, the regeneration of neglected urban spaces can improve business and residential areas, \nas multifunctional design with nature can create new dynamic spaces that increase land and \nneighbouring property values, thus attracting investors, whilst improving citizens’ well-being.  \nSecondly, sustainable urban planning with nature-based solutions has a positive environmental \nimpact. It provides opportunities for adaptation to climate change, thus increasing urban resilience \nto risks, such as droughts, floods and heatwaves, as well as opportunities for small-scale climate \nmitigation through increased carbon storage. It can also reduce pressure on peripheral natural \nareas, for example, waste water can be treated closer to residential sources and provide \nsatisfactory near-home recreation opportunities that diminish the need to travel for contact with \nnature.  \nThirdly, nature-based solutions contribute to the social dimension of sustainable urbanisation. For \nexample, green space availability can be related to people’s perceived happiness and general \nhealth, while having green space nearby appears to reduce the incidence of costly forms of illness, \nsuch as heart disease, obesity and depression. In England, the benefits of urban greenspaces for \nphysical and mental health have been estimated to reduce treatment costs by £2.1 billion4. Such \nbenefits appear to be stronger for vulnerable groups: children, elderly, and people of low socio-\neconomic status. Parks, urban farms and community gardens provide places for people to be \nphysically active and to meet others. Moving nature-based solutions higher up the urban design \nand planning agenda is a major opportunity to prepare our cities for the future, providing an \ninnovative ecosystems approach that can contribute to the resilience and economic growth of a city \nand to human well-being. \n \n                                                 \n8 Resilience addresses the capacity of a system to absorb shocks and disturbances and undergo change in \norder to maintain approximately the same identity (see Annex 2d for further details) \n9 UN (2014) http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Highlights/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf \n 9 \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, located in East London and a formerly deprived area, has been \nat the heart of a major urban regeneration plan, in view of the 2012 Olympic Games.  \nPhotos show parts of the area before and after the regeneration. \n 10 \n \nGoal 2: Improving the Restoration of Degraded Ecosystems (Annex 2b) \nIn Europe, significant areas of ecosystems are being lost or degraded as a result of human \nactivities. For example, between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely \ndestroyed10.The drivers of loss and degradation vary according to the ecosystem and location, but \nthe key pressures include agricultural intensification, grey infrastructure expansion, pollution of \nbrownfield sites, hydrological modifications to water bodies, the intensification of forestry practices \nand, generally speaking, climate change. These affect the ecosystems’ ability to function, deliver \necosystem services and meet other challenges, such as water purification, soil erosion protection, \nflood damage control, carbon sequestration and the provision of liveable places and recreational \nopportunities that contribute to human well-being, economic stability and physical security. \nAccording to economists, each year we lose 3% of GDP due to the loss of biodiversity and nature, \nwhich costs the EU €450 billion11. Whilst the first priority is to prevent further degradation of \necosystems and avoid unsustainable use of natural resources, the restoration of at least 15% of \ndegraded ecosystems is now a global and European goal.  \nA strategic opportunity is the growing interest and awareness of the need to maintain, and also to \nrestore, the functionality of degraded ecosystems and their services. It is seen as an essential \ningredient within future business investments for generating revenue and by society wishing to \nimprove the attractiveness of landscapes and cities, which would generate investment and other \neconomic benefits, as well as contributing to human health and well-being. \nThere is growing evidence that ecosystem restoration can also play a key role in increasing \nresilience to impending risks and threats. For example, coastal restoration makes coastal \ncommunities more resilient to sea level rise and storms by re-initiating natural sedimentation \nprocesses, and forest restoration protects against floods and mitigates runoff and landslides, for \nexample, by stabilising slopes. Restoring forest ecosystems through afforestation or change in \nmanagement can, amongst other things, significantly contribute to CO2 sequestration, achieving an \nadditional sink of 90 to 180 MtCO2/yr12 and reduce the risk of landslides and avalanches in \nmountainous areas resulting in high cost savings (e.g. between €1.5 to 2.5 billion per year in \nSwitzerland13). Such actions not only contribute to the stabilisation of ecosystems, but also can \ngenerate benefits exceeding investment costs in the long term. In Cambridgeshire, U.K., the \nconversion of drained, intensively farmed arable land to a wetland habitat resulted in a net gain to \nsociety of €160/ha/yr for a one-off investment in restoration of €1.900/ha14. Restoring and \nenhancing such habitats can also provide wider benefits, for example, boosting local tourism \nincluding related economic activities), providing employment and education opportunities and \naugmenting biodiversity conservation. \n \n                                                 \n10 Revenga, C. et al.

Photos show \nthe floodplain before and after the hydrological restoration, which included the removal of all \nartificial elements to generate a natural river bank structure \n 12 \n \nGoal 3: Developing Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation (CCAM) \n(Annex 2c) \nAddressing climate change is a challenge as its impacts on Europe are likely to increase and it \naffects all aspects of the environment, economy and society. For example, the annual damage of \nclimate change to the EU economy, measured as GDP loss from today’s conditions, could be \nbetween €20 billion for a 2.5°C scenario and €65 billion for a 5.4°C scenario with high sea level \nrise15. There are two responses to climate change: adaptation that seeks to reduce the impacts \nand mitigation to decrease CO2 emissions or energy demand or increase carbon storage. Climate \nchange is also one of the main drivers of ecosystem degradation and loss, often affecting the \nability of nature to provide solutions to the challenges our society faces. Since climate change is an \nover-arching and cross-cutting challenge, there is a need to develop integrated nature-based \nsolutions that address both adaptation and mitigation and can be applied across different sectors \nand/or goals and challenges.  \nOne important strategic opportunity area is integrating grey with green and blue infrastructure, so \nthat more traditional methods of management, for example water management in urban areas, are \ncomplemented or enhanced by using nature to increase their contribution to CCAM, as well as their \nsocial and economic benefits. Improved natural resource management by “zero waste” production \nis another critical area relevant to CCAM. Here, waste is seen as a resource and nature-inspired \nand nature-supported solutions can be applied, so that the use of resources is circular, with closed \nnutrient, gas, water and energy cycles, whenever possible. This could include re-designing human-\nmade infrastructure and production systems as natural ecosystems or developing nature-based \n“frugal technologies” for lowering energy use.  \nThe investment in CCAM nature-based solutions, such as developing low cost, low maintenance \nand low carbon emissions solutions to climate change mitigation will enhance the cost-\neffectiveness of responses to societal, environmental, and possibly economic challenges. This can \nalso be achieved, for example, by investing in new approaches such as bio-inspiration and \nbiomimicry, to enhance carbon sequestration through techniques, such as carbon \nbiomineralisation, as well as learning from how nature adapts to extreme events. \nA good example of a CCAM nature-based solution that meets several objectives and challenges is \nfloodplain restoration. For example, the floodplain of the Noordwaard polder, Netherlands is being \nrestored as part of the \"Room for the river\" programme16. The programme will provide climate \nchange-related flood protection for four million people, most of them in cities, improve the \nenvironmental quality for people and nature, and to increase recreational facilities and boost the \neconomy.  \n \n                                                 \n15 Ciscar, J. et al.

In the EU, between 2002 and 2012, numerous such events generated \n80,000 fatalities and €95 billion in economic losses18. Whilst fatalities are predominantly due to \nextreme temperatures, 40% of the damages and 50% of the total population affected are due to \nfloods. As human populations and activities are concentrated in exposed areas, such as cities, with \nclimate change, the damages could reach unbearable levels. Estimations of the expected annual \ndamages in Europe by the 2080s from coastal flooding are €17.4 to 25.4 billion (currently €1.9 \nbillion) and from fluvial flooding €97.9 billion (currently €5.5 billion)19, unless strong prevention \nand adaptation policies are implemented.  \nThe implementation of nature-based solutions offers major opportunities to reduce the frequency \nand/or intensity of different types of hazards. Therefore, they should form part of a range of \nmeasures and actions in integrated risk management, as they can provide more advantages than \nconventional methods. They combine multiple functions and benefits, for example, pollution \nreduction, carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and the provision of recreational activities and \neconomic opportunities. In the short term, these more continuous benefits are important and need \nto be demonstrated to ensure a widespread involvement of politicians and private companies in the \nimplementation and funding of such solutions. \nNature-based solutions also offer synergies in reducing multiple risks (for example drought and \nfloods) and meet the objectives of different European regulations, for instance the Flood Directive \nand the Water Framework Directive, as well as contributing to climate change adaptation and \nmitigation. A further strategic opportunity is the development of the methodology and empirical \nstudies of the insurance value of ecosystems, i.e. the value of the sustained capacity of \necosystems to maintain their functioning and production of benefits despite any disturbance.  \nCities are particularly concerned with improving their risk management and nature-based solutions \nare attractive, as in the long run they can be more cost-effective. There are a number of new \napproaches for the implementation of nature-based solutions including integrating living systems \nwith built systems through innovative combinations of soft and hard engineering. Heat stress in \ncities can be addressed by increasing green spaces and using green walls and green roofs. These \nmeasures could reduce temperature by up to 10oC in Mediterranean areas. All of these approaches \ncan also contribute to reducing flood risk and air pollution hazards, reducing energy demand in \nbuildings (by 10-15%) and improving quality of life. \n                                                 \n17 See Annex 2d for further information \n18 Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) \n19 European Commission, DG Environment (2014) Study on Economic and Social Benefits of Environmental \nProtection and Resource Efficiency Related to the European Semester. \n 15 \n \n \n \n \nImproved protection against natural hazards, including avalanches, through intentional \nafforestation, adapted forest management (densification) and additional technical measures in \nParsenn (Switzerland) between 1945 and 2007 \n 16 \n \nRECOMMENDED RESEARCH & INNOVATION ACTIONS \nSeven (7) priority nature-based research and innovation actions to meet societal challenges in the \nabove four goals have been identified.  \nUrban regeneration through nature-based solutions  \nChanges in land use, neglected land and abandoned areas are challenges \nfor many cities. Urban regeneration through nature-based solutions \noffers a context for innovative interventions for green growth.  \nNature-based solutions have an important role to play, for \ninstance, through supporting the implementation and \noptimisation of green, blue and grey infrastructure. Green \ninfrastructure can contribute to cutting energy and resource \ndemands and costs, as trees provide cooling and insulation and \nreduce the urban heat island effect, and green roofs and green \nwalls can decrease the need for heating and air conditioning. Co-\nbenefits include reduced air pollution, flood control, and recreation. \nPlanners are now seeking to exploit space more effectively through \nfinding new uses for underused and unused land and grey infrastructure, \noften using nature-based solutions. The Promenade Plantée in Paris, where an elevated freight rail \nline was transformed into a park and plans for the use of underground space for underground \nparks in New York (Low Line)20 are good examples. Possibilities for sustainable urban growth also \ncan be found in the conversion of abandoned land into urban farms and community gardens and \nthe regeneration of former factory sites through the bioremediation of toxic soils and subsequent \ntransformation into green space. Parco Nord in Milan is just one of many examples.  \nEfforts to identify and implement nature-based solutions may also drive the re-examination of the \neconomic basis of the cities and provide openings for businesses to innovate in the revitalisation of \nderelict urban and fringe areas. This may in turn drive innovation in business models which are \ndriven by sustainability concerns in cities and which decouple economic growth from resource \ndepletion and uneven resource distribution. Cities can serve as laboratories for innovation, \nexperimentation and testing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions, with a view to maximising \na range of environmental, social and economic co-benefits for all. Existing city networks can \nfacilitate the replication of demonstration projects and up-scaling capacity of interventions.  \nNature-based solutions for improving well-being in urban areas \nWith millions more people needing housing, services, workplaces, \ninfrastructure and institutions by 205021, the potential impacts of \ndevelopment decisions are unparalleled. By integrating nature-\nbased solutions into urban design and planning, increasingly large \nand dense cities can improve human health and well-being, while \noffering ecological and economic co-benefits. \nAn increasingly strong evidence base shows the positive effects \nof access to green spaces and good-quality landscape on health, \nwell-being, social cohesion and community support. Using nature-\nbased solutions to enhance neighbourhood spaces can stimulate \nhealthy physical activity and promote the development of social ties, \nas citizens are attracted outdoors to utilise public spaces together and \nin greater numbers feel safer to move around freely22. Even a permanent \n1% reduction in the sedentary population of the UK could deliver up to £ 1.44bn a year in \n                                                 \n20 The LowLine (2015) http://www.thelowline.org/about/project \n21 UN (2014) http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Highlights/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf \n22 Coley, R.L., Kuo, F.E., and Sullivan, W.C.

In the future, the challenge for urban planning will not just be in squeezing the most out of \nthe space, but in squeezing the most out of the experience of urban life and green spaces that can \nbring important benefits in delivering a more livable urban environment24. Therefore, there is a \nneed for demonstration projects which show how the multiple social benefits, and other co-\nbenefits, of nature-based solutions can be most effectively realised through the systemic \nintegration of nature-based solutions into urban planning. \nUrban planners need to promote the flexibility of spaces and services, but also to stimulate change \nthrough adaptability and innovation. This means reconsidering the natural and built environment \nand the attitudes of officials and citizens. Those engaged in creating healthy places, such as public \nhealth professionals and landscape architects already widely recognise urban greening as an asset \nthat has enormous potential to improve health and well-being25. The search for locally suitable \nnature-based solutions will provide a context in which these professionals also can explore the \nflexibility of spaces and services, and in turn stimulate change through adaptability and innovation. \nNature-based solutions also appear to resonate with the urban publics, and citizen empowerment \nand citizen-driven innovation are crucial to capitalising on the potential benefits of nature-based \nsolutions for urban social regeneration. New forms of stakeholder engagement and citizen \nparticipation in urban design and planning must be explored in order to harvest these innovative \ncapabilities, resources and cooperation. \nEstablishing nature-based solutions for coastal resilience  \nCoastal habitats are iconic and of considerable economic and social \nimportance across the EU, protecting against floods and erosion, \nwhile providing livelihoods for many individuals through tourism \nand fishing. With sea level rise, isostatic change (the tendency for \nsome areas to sink) and increasing flood risks there is growing \nawareness that the cost-effectiveness of hard engineering (e.g. \nthe provision of built coastal defences) has to be discussed. \nAlternatives, including soft engineering options such as restoring \nsalt marshes, have been shown in many cases to be highly \nrelevant in reducing flood risk, while other options may reduce \nthe risk of coastal erosion. These more nature-based options can \nhave multiple benefits, for example, in attracting tourists, increasing \nnatural productivity and thus fish stocks, benefiting wildlife and \nimproving water quality.  \nNew evidence shows that substantial changes have been and are being experienced by many \nintertidal and subtidal habitats26. For example, oyster reefs were once ubiquitous in estuaries but \nmany of these have now disappeared and the extensive sea grass beds are also largely gone. \nStudies have shown that that these had substantial roles in settling sediment by providing physical \nstructures and improving water quality through the filtration by oysters, mussels or clams27 and \noxygenating it through photosynthesis.  \nRestoration of coastal habitats has tended to be neglected compared to other habitats and there is \nconsiderably greater uncertainty regarding the most suitable methods for these habitats compared \nto well-established approaches, such as tree planting or creating wetlands, for purely terrestrial \nhabitats. There is a considerable need for scientific research and the development of innovative \nmethods to identify the cost-effective means of restoring coastal habitats and assessing the \nassociated co-benefits. \n                                                 \n23 CJC Consulting (2005) Green Spaces for Physical and Mental Health: Scoping Study.

Floodplain restoration, for example, can \ngenerate multiple benefits. In the case of the River Elbe and its \ntributaries, it had a total economic benefit of €1.2 billion and a \ncost-benefit ratio of 1:328. The benefits included protection from \nflood damage, improved living conditions for wild species, re-\nflooding of carbon-rich soils, reduction of nutrient loads and \nlandscape improvements. Restoring degraded terrestrial \necosystems, such as grasslands, arable land and forests, as well \nas former industrial and brownfield sites by using nature-based \nsolutions also can deliver a variety of benefits, including improved \nwater quality, carbon sequestration, and attractive landscapes. The \nrestoration of peatlands, for example, can reduce current emissions of 10-\n20 t CO2/hectare29 and for England this has been estimated at being worth £570 million over 40 \nyears. It would also improve water supply, as well as species and habitat conservation. Restoration \nactions can create recreational areas and jobs too, which serve to sustain human well-being. It has \nbeen estimated that upstream of cities and on suitable lower grade agricultural land, wetland \ncreation could give a benefit:cost ratio of 3:1 and possibly up to 9:130.  \nIn addition to ensuring adequate institutional frameworks and greater connectivity between legal \nframeworks, banks and (health and risk) insurance companies should be approached as key \npotential investors given the (insurance) value of ecosystems in relation to other investments and \ntheir function, for example, in mitigating risks to human health and real estate. Particular attention \nmust be paid to the involvement of society and individuals in restoration actions, with the aim of \nre-connecting people with nature, raising awareness of societal benefits and creating a public \ndemand for restoration actions. In this context, living labs that allow for the development and \ntesting of new forms of social engagement and financing can be a potential instrument. \nNature-based solutions for increasing the sustainable use of matter and \nenergy \nNature-based solutions can decrease resource demand through energy \nand matter-efficient processes. In cities, green spaces and green \nroofs provide natural cooling or insulation. Nature-based chemical \nprocesses, either bio-inspired or bio-supported are already \ncontributing to a greener chemistry using fewer natural resources \nand preventing pollution31. Regarding manufacturing, room \ntemperature “growing materials” using mycelium and organic \nwaste have been recently commercialised32, as well as nature-\nbased 3D printing techniques33. \nAlso, solutions inspired by nature can improve resource efficiency \nby providing a range of alternative sources of energy and matter, \nwhich are based on potentially renewable, organic sources, including \nbiofuels and biomaterials, artificial photosynthesis or growing algae to \nproduce hydrogen34. Several studies currently address the possibilities of copying atmospheric \n                                                 \n28 Grossmann, M., Hartje, V. & Meyerhoff, J.

In a world facing greater \nuncertainties and in the light of projected climate change impacts, \nthere is an increasing interest in nature-based solutions, such as \ninvestments in green infrastructure and the restoration of \necosystems to reduce risks (e.g. of flooding, heat waves). The \ninsurance value of an ecosystem results from the system itself \nhaving the capacity to cope with external disturbances and \nincludes both an estimate of the risk reduction due to the physical \npresence of an ecosystem (e.g. area of upstream land/number of \ndownstream properties protected) and the capacity to sustain risk \nreduction (i.e. the resilience of the system). There is an urgent need \nto scientifically explore methodologies and conceptual frameworks for \nassessing the insurance value of nature and to integrate this into the disaster risk management \nagenda. This could be done, for example, by working with financial institutions and insurance \ncompanies to develop innovative ways for promoting nature-based solutions for risk management. \nOne strategy could be to translate risk reduction capacity into value through calculating \nbenefit/investment ratios in landscape management and restoration. Here, the benefits would \nrepresent the reduced risk and potential lower premiums of land and property insurance policies. A \nnew legal framework that serves to create incentives for maintaining or enhancing the insurance \ncapacity of ecosystems should be explored. It would be important to first develop a framework \nwhere the models and data (including downscaled climate change scenarios) capturing the capacity \nof ecosystems to reduce risks are made compatible and harmonised with the risk assessment \nmodels and data used by the private insurance sector. Secondly, to develop an economic approach \nto understanding ecosystems as representing the stock that generates the flow of services and \nexplore how to capture the long-term benefits of maintaining and enhancing that stock. Thirdly, to \nexplore the cultural dimension of the insurance value of ecosystems and people’s perceptions of \nrisks and insurance. \nIncreasing carbon sequestration through nature-based solutions  \nOver the last 30 years, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems have \nstored about a quarter of human generated CO2 emissions37. \nEnhancing such carbon sequestration is one of the major issues for \nclimate change mitigation. This challenge can be addressed by \nusing methods that increase the biomass of living organisms, as \nwell as by a range of new nature-based solutions, such as \nbiosequestration, i.e. the use of living organisms as natural \n(longer-term) carbon stores. Some plants can store carbon in \ninorganic forms as phytoliths (“stones”). Wheat cultivars, for \nexample, differ by a factor of 10 in their ability to store carbon in \nthis way and phytolith carbon biosequestration rates indicate a \nsubstantial potential of about 50mt CO2 equivalent yr–1 38.

They represent an effective, \nresource-efficient and flexible approach to sustainable and inclusive economic growth, while \nimproving human health and well-being and the natural environment. They can improve resilience \nto natural disasters and offer cost-effective options for adapting to climate change and reducing \npollution. Inspiration and support from nature can stimulate scientific innovation and strengthen \nthe economy. The goals and research and innovation actions clearly demonstrate the opportunities \nto put nature-based solutions into practice. Examples of current nature-based solutions that could \nbe applied or enhanced are provided in Annex 4. They also do not have clear boundaries and may \nintersect with other policy areas, such as eco-innovation and the bio-economy. \nThe scaling-up of nature-based solutions across Europe, through a better evidence base \nThere is a clear need to compile a more comprehensive evidence base on the social, economic and \nenvironmental effectiveness of possible nature-based solutions, including a comparison with more \ntraditional solutions. The evidence base should also address the limits to nature-based solutions: \nbeyond certain boundaries of environmental change (e.g. in precipitation and temperature) where \neven large investments may result in small net effects in, for example, risk reduction. The \nimportance of actions being based on sound evidence and how this can be achieved can be \nsummarised in two main recommendations for evidence-based actions and policy-making (see \nAnnex 3): \n1. That the evidence on the social, economic and environmental effectiveness of key nature-\nbased solutions under different conditions is assessed as soon as possible, as a coordination \nand support action, but building on existing initiatives. Ideally this should be prior to the \nmain projects being implemented, to make the subsequent actions as effective as possible.  \n2. That the nature-based solutions are designed and implemented with the co-production of \nscientifically sound knowledge through multi-stakeholder engagement, so that the \nexperience gained is shared with others.  \nThe results of the research and innovation actions would form an important input to the evidence \nbase. This would offer the opportunity to test the transferability of various solutions to different \nconditions in other regions of Europe, and devise models and large-scale demonstration projects \nfor scaling up local solutions to tackle larger scale problems. It is important to synthesise and \ncommunicate the results effectively to maximise uptake of the most effective solutions. \nThe development of new business and investment models and legal and institutional \nframeworks for nature-based solutions \nMany of the research and innovation actions need further development and testing to establish \nhow they can be turned into bankable opportunities, scaled up to leverage private capital flows, or \ntransferred to other locations or actions. In order to be effective, they must also be successfully \nembedded into society, business and policy. This will require (i) adequate integrated institutional \nand legal frameworks and governance structures, so that the multiple benefits arising from nature-\nbased solutions are captured, (ii) new business and cooperation models involving the private sector \nand enabling long-term financing, including public-private partnerships and market incentives. \nThese all need to be developed, tested and employed.  \nThe empowerment, involvement and reconnection of citizens with nature to enhance \ntheir well-being \nNature-based solutions offer a tremendous opportunity to enhance well-being and strengthen \ncommunity cohesion. Particular attention must be paid to the involvement of society and \nindividuals in restoration and other nature-based solutions, with the aim of re-connecting people \n 22 \n \nwith nature, raising awareness of societal benefits, and creating a public demand for healthy \nnatural environments. In this context, living labs that allow for the development and testing of new \nforms of social engagement and financing can be a potential instrument. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n41 The reports from the e-consultation and the stakeholder workshop can be downloaded from: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index_en.cfm  \nThe Horizon 2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-naturing Cities \nThe European Commission is developing a Research and Innovation agenda on Nature-Based \nSolutions to address some of the most pressing societal challenges of our time.

They are actions inspired by, supported by or copied \nfrom nature; both using and enhancing existing solutions to challenges, as well as exploring more \nnovel solutions, for example, mimicking how non-human organisms and communities cope with \nenvironmental extremes. Nature-based solutions use the features and complex system processes \nof nature, such as its ability to store carbon and regulate water flows, in order to achieve desired \noutcomes, such as reduced disaster risk and an environment that improves human well-being and \nsocially inclusive green growth. This implies that maintaining and enhancing natural capital is of \ncrucial importance, as it forms the basis for solutions. These nature-based solutions ideally are \nresilient to change, as well as energy and resource efficient, but in order to achieve these criteria, \nthey must be adapted to local conditions.  \nThe “nature-based solution” concept builds on and supports other closely related concepts, such as \nthe ecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem-based adaptation/mitigation, and green \nand blue infrastructure. They all recognise the importance of nature and require a systemic \napproach to environmental change based on an understanding of the structure and functioning of \necosystems, including human actions and their consequences. Nature-based solutions, however, \nhave a distinctive set of premises: (i) some societal challenges stem from human activities that \nhave failed to recognize ecological limitations; (ii) sustainable alternatives to those activities can \nbe found by looking to nature for design and process knowledge. They therefore involve the \ninnovative application of knowledge about nature, inspired and supported by nature, and they \nmaintain and enhance natural capital. They are positive responses to societal challenges, and can \nhave the potential to simultaneously meet environmental, social and economic objectives. \nThere has been much debate over the components of nature-based solutions and, within the \ncurrent EU framework, nature-based solutions exclude methods that artificially alter nature, such \nas genetically modified organisms.  \n 25 \n \nANNEX 2: THEMATIC GOALS \nAnnex 2a: Enhancing sustainable urbanisation \n1. Challenge, Trend \nCurrently, 73% of Europe’s population live in cities and this is projected to increase to 82% by \n2050, resulting in over 36 million new urban citizens42. Not only does the rapid urbanisation \nprocess affect the availability of resources in European cities, but it also poses challenges to \nequitable economic growth43. Due to the ongoing economic recession, European cities are \nstruggling to integrate economic migrants, which puts further pressure on living conditions, health \nand quality of life in cities. We need to rethink our cities, if we are to achieve significant social, \neconomic and environmental gains. They need to be developed and regenerated, so that they \nprovide healthy and liveable environments. Thus, when addressing sustainable urbanisation, \nincluding health and well-being, we must consider the social, environmental and economic aspects \nof cities and the complex relationship between them.  \n2. Strategic Opportunity Areas \nx Sustainable urbanisation requires increased attention on how human health and wellbeing in \ncities can be maintained and promoted. This challenge calls for improved residential design and \ntransportation systems44, new technologies45, new business models46 and a stronger focus on \nhealthy urban environments through accessible green spaces and public sites.  \nx The enhancement of the quality of life is a crucial factor for the sustainability, vitality and \ncompetitiveness of a city. Nature-based solutions can play a pivotal role by in many areas - \nensuring access to basic necessities, as well as supporting health-promoting individual activities \nand meaningful interactions among fellow citizens as well as improving the attractiveness of \ncities to residents and businesses, thus influencing property value and economic activity and \nproviding climate change resilience. However, the precise ways in how urban greenspaces can \nachieve these outcomes needs further assessment47. \nx One of the socio-economic benefits of the greening of neighbourhood spaces is that social ties \nand support networks are strengthened, as citizens are encouraged to utilize these public \nspaces and be less fearful of moving around freely48. Therefore, there is a need for more \nawareness of the benefits of nature-based solutions in public spaces such as parks, squares, \nschools, and hospitals.  \nx Economic development in urban areas is highly dependent on the wealth and quality of natural \nresources. This means that we will have to find new ways of maintaining growth that do not \nextract and deplete our scarce natural resources, and it calls for business innovation modelling \non how nature-based solutions have the potential to reduce energy and resource costs \ndrastically and act as carbon sinks to mitigate risks of climate change. \nx Nature-based solutions can also be used to tackle increased inequality and unemployment \namongst youth. The economic recession has put an even greater strain on cities and forced \n                                                 \n42 UN (2014) http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Highlights/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf  \n43 UN population Division (2010) cited in European Environment Agency, 2010.

This presents the opportunity to think and \nact in new ways, by viewing cities as innovation hubs for nature-based solutions. Nature-based \nsolutions in sustainable urban planning are most often linked to the regeneration of derelict \nareas, the improvement of recreation facilities and to the general well-being of citizens. \nHowever, they can also be used to stimulate growth and new jobs by encouraging nature-based \nsolutions, actions and demonstration projects with a strong replication and up-scaling capacity, \nusing existing city networks to identify frontrunners and followers. This approach can also be \napplied to historic districts in cities, as well as derelict industrial sites and run-down urban areas \nthat can be transformed by enhancing their attractiveness and converting their use. Attention \nshould also be paid to visionary approaches for innovation cities using nature, such as climate-\nadapted and resource-efficient nature-based solutions for improved transportation systems49, \nnew technologies50 and new business models51. Policies should encourage developers and local \nauthorities to consider nature-based solutions from the outset of any urban project or strategy. \n3. Examples of Nature-Based Solutions \nx Careful deployment of nature-based solutions in the city can cut energy and resource costs and \nact as carbon sinks to mitigate risks of climate change. For example, energy savings from green \nroofs have been estimated at around 10-15%52, with a 12% reduction in energy demand \nreported for a green roof in the Mediterranean region53, while in cities such as Athens, they \nhave been shown to be able to reduce high cooling loads in buildings by 66%, with 4-hour \nreductions in cooling energy demand being reported54. They may also contribute to improving \nhuman health. \nx Increasing the provision of greenspace can ameliorate the temperature of urban areas, thus \nreducing heat stress. Urban parks have been found to be able to reduce ambient daytime \ntemperature by an average of 0.94°C; with an average night-time reduction of 1.15°C55. While \nmodelling found that a 10% increase in the green area dense urban areas of Greater \nManchester could retain maximum surface temperatures at, or below the 1961-1990 baseline \nuntil the 2080s for all emissions scenarios, thus mitigating the effects of climate change56. \nx Living close to green space has a positive influence on several general health indicators for \n(including perceived health, stress and disease morbidity)57 and may also reduce crime rates. It \nhas been estimated that the provision of equitable access to good quality green space for every \nhousehold in England could lead to annual savings of £2.1bn in averted health costs58. \n \n4.

Natural England Report, Sheffield. \n 27 \n \nThe potential of nature-based solutions needs further investigation, particularly with regard to \nthe generation of co-benefits. Measures such as green spaces, street greenery and green roofs \nare known to provide a variety of environmental benefits, as well as improve the liveability of \ncities, enhance their economic development and contribute positively to the health and social \nwell-being of urban citizens. However, where knowledge of specific types of benefits is already \navailable, it commonly requires integrating with knowledge regarding other types of benefits. \nFurther attention also needs to be given to mapping the opportunities available for new nature-\nbased solutions associated with buildings and infrastructure in cities, and for improving nature-\nbased solutions currently in place. \nx Research on the effectiveness of nature-based interventions  \nIn addition to organizing and integrating evidence regarding known benefits of nature-based \nsolutions that have already been deployed, research and innovation efforts should address \npossible new nature-based solutions, considering questions about their effectiveness, such as:  \ni. What combinations and configurations of vegetation in different sizes can maximize \ncarbon capture and shading provision while also enhancing resident quality of life? \nii. How can mobile green walls be designed and employed to provide opportunities to adapt \nand reshape spaces externally and internally, to help control temperature, improve air \nquality, reduce demand for building infrastructure, and offer aesthetic appeal? \niii. How can existing grey infrastructure be greened and joined up with existing green spaces \nand urban greenery (e.g., street trees) so that cities enable a perception of a green living \nenvironment despite increasing residential densities? \niv. How can interstitial spaces in cities (rooftops, public parks, road edges, and underused \ninfrastructure) be more extensively used for urban food production?  \nv. What is the feasibility of vertical farms in cities, and what business models can support \ntheir development? \nx Demonstrate the effectiveness of nature-based solutions \nSome questions of effectiveness will be best addressed through demonstration projects. Cities \ncan serve as laboratories for innovation, experimentation and testing of good practices, \nmethods and tools for the identification of effective of nature-based solutions, which maximise a \nrange of ecological, social and economic co-benefits. Existing city networks can facilitate the \nreplication of demonstration projects and up-scaling capacity of interventions.  \nx Research on how the uptake of nature-based solutions can be encouraged \nChanges in policy, legislation and spatial planning are all possible ways of influencing the \nuptake of nature-based solutions and there are examples of each of these in practice. How each \nof these singly, or in combination, could be used to enhance the uptake and success of nature-\nbased solutions needs further research. This research should build on the demonstrated \neffectiveness of different interventions.  \nx Developing business models that enable economic growth through sustainable urbanisation, \nwhilst providing health and social and economic progress for citizens and businesses \nResearch is needed on the economic gains achieved through nature-based solutions as \ncomponents in sustainable urbanisation and how these gains translate into health and social \nbenefits. Research and innovation efforts are also required to develop approaches (including \nfinancing mechanisms and capital market solutions) to cost-effectively scale up nature-based \nsolutions, thereby leveraging increased capital flow and fostering partnerships. Attention also \nneeds to be given to potential systemic changes toward a circular economy, including \ndemonstration projects on eco-innovative business models and services, such as reuse, repair \nand recycling of resources across value chains and ecologically sensitive design of products.  \nx Identify how nature-based solutions can be enhanced by connecting actors and activities \nNature-based solutions will require tools and methods for engaging with multiple stakeholders \nby facilitating communication and dissemination that will establish the ground for future \ncollaborations, innovations and recommendations. There is also a need to explore how to instill \ncitizen-driven empowerment, involvement in and ownership of nature-based solutions in cities, \ngiven their general health and social implications. \n \n 28 \n \n5. Actors \nEurope is faced with a series of global urban mega trends and challenges that require collaboration \nof actors, working across different professions and disciplines, sectors, institutions, governments \nand national borders. These diverse actors include practitioners, researchers, citizens, grass-root \nactivists, policy-makers, think-tanks, companies involved in the design, creation and maintenance \nof nature etc. Numerous methods and approaches are available to facilitate multi-stakeholder \ninvolvement, including methods of co-creation, crowd-sourcing, taskforce groups, grassroots \ninitiatives, citizen movements, social innovation community, amongst others. These offer viable \nways of engaging complex multi-stakeholder collaboration in accelerating the identification, \nimplementation and evaluation of nature-based solutions. \nWe need to draw on expertise from multiple stakeholders, including actors from the private and \npublic sectors. To achieve more systemic urban governance, it is important to use a multi-\nstakeholder approach. This acknowledges how the individuals, organisations and governments, in \ninteraction with others, play a pivotal role in identifying new ways, innovations and knowledge for \nbetter cities. There is a need for overarching coordination in order to map, analyse and assess \nexisting successful business models, financing mechanisms and municipal initiatives to innovate \ncities with nature-based solutions, while adopting a systemic, multi-stakeholder and trans-\ndisciplinary approach. The focus should be not only on capital cities but also on small-medium \ncities. Moreover, there is a need to propose and suggest tools and trainings for visionary \narchitects, practitioners and policy makers. \n6. Indicators \nAs an answer to the claim of sustainability, cities should be approached as labs and hubs for \ninnovation and experimentation in the field of nature-based solutions. One way to maintain this \ndevelopment is by encouraging actions and demonstration projects with a strong replication and \nup-scaling capacity, relying on existing city networks to identify frontrunners and followers. \nMoreover, we need to pay attention to historic districts in cities, as well as derelict industrial sites \nand vast urban areas that are not functioning anymore, but can be transformed by enhancing their \nattractiveness and converting their use. Strong attention should be also paid to visionary \napproaches for innovating cities with nature, combining engineering and scientific approaches (i.e. \neco-dynamic solutions). In addition, the demonstration projects should prove the added value of \nNBS for energy efficiency and climate change resilience in particular in contrasting urban heat \nisland effect and investigating into blue and green solutions, creating recreational areas, improving \nair quality and reducing noise. Policies that encourage developers and local authorities to consider \nNBS from the outset of any urban project or strategy.  \n \n 29 \n \nAnnex 2b: Restoring degraded ecosystems \n1. Challenge, Trend \nAs a result of human activities significant areas of ecosystems are being lost or degraded especially \nby fragmentation, change in management, pollution and invasive species. The details of the drivers \nvary according to ecosystem type, but the key European pressures include agricultural \nintensification, grey infrastructure expansion, pollution of brownfield sites, hydrological \nmodifications to water bodies, the intensification of forestry practices and, generally speaking, \nclimate change. The resultant degradation threatens the health of ecosystems and their ability to \nfunction and deliver essential services, such as water purification, carbon storage, soil erosion \nprotection, nutrient cycling, flood damage control, forest carbon storage, and the provisioning of \nliveable places and recreational opportunities. Consequently, degraded ecosystems also jeopardize \nhuman well-being, economic stability and physical security. While the first priority is to prevent \nfurther degradation of ecosystems and avoid unsustainable use of natural resources, the \nrestoration of degraded ecosystems presents a current major key challenge. \n2. Strategic opportunity areas \nx With increasing population and expanding resource needs there are increasing competing \ndemand for land within Europe, whether for agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, industry, \nhuman settlements or for provision of environmental benefits. Restoring degraded land can \nreduce this demand by increasing the social and economic benefits to society that such land \nprovides. \nx There is growing appreciation of the benefits of restoring ecosystems and establish a green \ninfrastructure that delivers a wide range of services of benefits to society, such as reduced \nstormwater runoff or decreased costs of dealing with extreme temperatures.  \nx There is growing interest and awareness within the business community of the need to \nmaintain, and also to restore, the functionality of degraded ecosystems and their services, as \nan essential ingredient within business investments for generating revenue. \nx There is an increased awareness of and a rapidly growing interest across society in \nimplementing solutions that increase the attractiveness of landscapes and cities so generating \ninvestment and economic benefits and contributing to human health and well-being. \nx It is increasingly appreciated that environmental restoration can play a key role in increasing \nresilience to impending threats, such as climate change, by, for example, limiting extreme \ntemperatures of urban environments and making coastal communities more capable of \nwithstanding sea level rise.  \nx Restoration may lead to economic and social regeneration through increasing the environmental \nquality of life. Landscape improvements can lead to enhanced investment, greater job \nopportunities and reduced social tension.  \n3. Examples of Nature-Based Solutions \nx Enhanced flood alleviation and improved water quality. Reducing the risk of flooding impacting \nupon society by the restoration of watersheds, wetlands, woodlands, riverbanks and floodplains, \nso delaying the downstream passage of flood flow, enhancing rainfall infiltration into the soil \nand increasing flood storage capacity so reducing extent and speed of water runoff. Restored \nareas are likely to have further benefits for society including through recreation, tourism, and \nincreased investment linked to the enhanced human well-being.  \nx Coastal protection to deal with sea level rise and storm risk. Natural habitats, such as \nsaltmarshes, dunes and reclaimed coastal areas, that allow natural processes, such as coastal \nsedimentation, have often been shown to provide cost effective solutions compared to hard \nengineering options. Restoring and enhancing such habitats can also provide wider benefits, for \nexample to tourism and biodiversity conservation.  \nx Climate change mitigation. Afforestation and rewetting peatlands, financed through CO2 \ncertificates and public private partnerships (including foundations, schools, public authorities) \n 30 \n \nand involving a wide range of stakeholders, such as individuals, tourists, schools or business, \ncan serve to enhance carbon storage and provide a range of simultaneous solutions to society. \n4. Research & Innovation Actions \nx Synthesise and prepare relevant information for end-users \nThere is a considerable body of literature on the various means of restoring a range of habitats \nincluding grasslands, wetlands, woodlands, dune and marine habitats, but this information \nneeds to be collated, synthesised and summarised to make it accessible to practitioners and \ndecision-makers. Develop and establish platforms for exchange of experiences and knowledge \nacross Member States. \nx Assess the effectiveness of possible restoration intervention options   \nDevelop user-friendly tools to assess the cost-effectiveness of different options for ecosystem \nrestoration as well as alternative (engineered) options incorporating a combination of \necosystem services and considering the full range of benefits, including the environmental, \nsocial and economic ones.  \nx Develop business and investment models and corresponding platforms to create opportunities \nfor public-private partnerships and (voluntary) market-based incentives for business and \nindividuals \nIdentify mechanisms to encourage and/or support actors (companies and financial institutions – \nbanks, pension funds) to invest in and restore/re-nature degraded ecosystems and also create \nsupporting and adequate legislative and institutional structures to enable investments in \necosystem restoration. \nx Establish demonstration projects to reconnect people with nature and facilitate social learning \nDesign and initiate restoration projects at a local level that target/re-connect urban and peri-\nurban populations, together with children and young people, with nature and facilitate project \nownership, build a sense of community and support shifts in mindsets and behaviours. \nx Develop business models to involve health insurance companies in restoration activities \nDevelop business models and means for collaboration to enhance physical and mental health \ne.g. by increasing opportunities for physical activity and facilitating behavioural change. Target \nthe generation of funds and investments to invest in the restoration of degraded areas, which \ncan serve as recreational and sport areas and increase mental health.  \nx Develop business models for mainstreaming restoration into planning and economic decisions  \nDevelop business models incorporating the value of ecosystems and ecosystem services, and \nthen mainstreaming them into planning and economic decisions.  \nx Develop innovative methods for delivering ecosystem services \nInnovative methods are needed for ensuring the delivery of essential ecosystem services, such \nas reducing soil erosion, CO2 sequestration and enhancing coastal protection using nature-\nbased solutions. \nx Find means of leveraging funding \nGiven that capital flows are constrained by uncertainties around public policies and budgetary \nchallenges, we need to find a way to leverage capital flows (maybe using EU funds as a \ncatalyst).  \nx Applying general methods to local conditions  \nThe variation in soil, climate and hydrological conditions means that there is a need for \ndetermining and guidance on how different restoration methods, including different landscape \npatterns, planning procedures and vegetation types, are best fitted to local environments.  \n \n 31 \n \nAnnex 2c: Developing climate change adaptation and mitigation \n1. Challenge, Trend  \nClimate change is a challenge as its impacts on Europe are likely to increase and it affects all \naspects of the environment, economy and society, therefore, it is relevant to all the objectives in \nthis report. Also, it is one of the main drivers of biodiversity degradation and loss, often negatively \naffecting the ability of nature to provide solutions to the challenges our society faces. Climate \nchange adaptation and mitigation (CCAM) are different, but complementary strategies for \naddressing their impacts forms an over-arching and cross-cutting priority given the widespread \nimpacts of climate changes. A holistic approach, therefore, is needed in order to integrate solutions \nthat meet both adaptation and mitigation objectives, harmonises regulations and mainstreams \nCCAM into sectoral policies. Nature-based approaches to CCAM present possible solutions, but less \nis known about the extent to which CCAM can address not only mean climate change and extreme \nweather events, but also other environmental, social and economic challenges. In this context, a \ntheoretical and empirical exploration of the concept of insurance value of ecosystems is needed.  \n2. Strategic opportunity areas  \nA number of innovative nature-based opportunities for CCAM exist, both for further development of \nspecific methods of CCAM, but also the realisation of the cross-sectoral synergies. These include:  \nx Developing holistic, integrated nature-based solutions for CCAM, that are applicable across \ndifferent sectors and/or challenges, such as integrating grey, green and blue infrastructure and \nenhancing the natural components, as well as the social and economic benefits. \nx Improved natural resource management by “zero waste” production, where waste is seen as a \nresource and the use of natural resources is circular, learning from and thus mimicking natural \necosystems, such that nutrient, gas, water and energy cycles are closed whenever possible. \nThis could include re-designing human-made infrastructure as natural ecosystems, using both \nnature-inspired and nature-supported solutions or developing nature-based “frugal \ntechnologies” for lowering energy use.  \nx Enhancing the cost-effectiveness of responses to societal and environmental challenges through \ninvesting in NBS which can address multiple challenges, such as developing low cost, low \nmaintenance and low carbon emissions solutions to climate change challenges.  \nx Responsible innovation through investing in new approaches, for example bio-inspiration and \nbiomimicry, to enhance carbon sequestration through techniques, such as carbon \nbiomineralisation, as well as learning from how nature adapts to extreme events. \n3. Examples of Nature-Based Solutions  \nx Flood risk management– floodplain recreation can be the/part of the solution to flood risk \nthrough increasing water storage and slowing river response times. It can have multiple other \nbenefits including: long-term improvement in water quality, increase in wetland habitats and \nspecies and carbon sequestration. The restoration of the flood plain of the Noordwaard polder, \nNetherlands is a good example. There is, however, a mitigation trade-off with increased CH4 \nand N2O emissions.  \nx Heat stress in urban environments – green infrastructure can decrease temperatures and heat \nstress events. Trees are particularly effective, but green roofs and walls, gardens and parks all \ncontribute, not only in addressing this issue, but also they are a good example of integrated \nNBS, as they can improve human health and well-being, biodiversity, reduce flood and drought \nrisk and store carbon.  \nx Carbon sequestration for climate mitigation – planting sustainable woodlands can not only \nprovide a long-term store for carbon, but also they can be beneficial for biodiversity, provide \nrecreational opportunities and a source of natural products.  \n 32 \n \n4. Research & Innovation Actions \nx Strengthen knowledge of the multiple benefits of nature-based CCAM and trade-offs \nKnowledge on the trade-offs both between different nature-based CCAM actions and across \nother priorities is needed. This will require the assessment and/or improvement of (i) tools that \ncan assess specific impacts in a particular context, (ii) indicators of impact. Green infrastructure \ncould provide a good test case. \nx Demonstrate how CCAM nature-based solutions can be embedded in local level spatial planning \nand decision-making \nThis could include (i) the creation of living labs within cities, as a demonstration space, empty \nof rules where new forms of planning can be tested and demonstrated, and solutions can be \ntranslated to local situations. This would help to build up the evidence on the effectiveness of \nNBS in different contexts. \nx R&I projects on different forms of carbon biosequestration \nThese could include assessments of their potential for upscaling and how pilot schemes can be \nadapted to different industrial and agricultural settings, as well as to include communities and \nhouseholds. Also analyse their multiple benefits which could help speed up marketability and \nwould be a way to ensure other revenue streams to help the translation of the activity into an \nincome generating action. \nx Research on how energy and matter is produced and used by nature \nThere are many ways in which we could learn from how nature produces matter and uses \nenergy (e.g. algal systems that capture CO2 or recycle organic waste as a carbon source to \nproduce feed or new energy, where larger scale demonstration is needed), how nature uses \nthem efficiently (e.g. buildings with microalgae on the façade which can treat wastewater and \nprovide other ecosystem services) and how energy and matter flow. \nx Research on how to translate the adaptation strategies of ecosystems to climatic stresses into \ninnovative solutions  \nResearch is needed to identify key climate stresses and analyse and map examples of species’ \nresponses (e.g. how trees deal with drought). \nx Develop methods and models for analysing the socio-economic benefits of nature-based CCAM \nDevelop methods and models for analysing qualitatively and/or quantitatively the socio-\neconomic benefits of nature-based CCAM, both in the short- and longer-term. This could include \nalso (i) the investments needed to sustain the insurance capacity of ecosystems, (ii) an analysis \nof the effectiveness of performance-based contracts, (iii) a comparison of grey, green and blue \ninfrastructure. \n \n 33 \n \nAnnex 2d: Improving Risk Management and Resilience \n1. Challenge, Trend \nOur world is exposed to a range of natural and technological hazard types: drought, earthquakes, \nepidemics, extreme temperatures, floods, industrial accidents, wet mass movements (landslides \nand avalanches), storms, transport accidents, volcanoes and wildfires. Between 2002 and 2013, \nwithin the European Union, numerous events generated more than 80,000 fatalities and several \nhundreds of billions euros of damages. Whilst fatalities are, for great part, due to extreme \ntemperature, floods account for 40% of the amount of damages and 50% of the total population \naffected. Without strong prevention and adaptation policies, the damages could reach unbearable \namounts by the end of 21st century, due to the evolution of human activities concentrated in \nexposed areas and to the effects of climate change (floods, heatwaves, droughts). Most Nature-\nBased Solutions (NBS) should aim to reduce the frequency or intensity of different types of hydro-\nmeteorological hazards, such as floods, drought, heat waves, forest fires and reduce their impacts, \nthus making the system more resilient59. However, it is evident that they don’t offer complete \nprotection to vulnerable exposed territories/communities and there is always a residual risk of \nlarge-scale potential events. NBS are, therefore, not the only solution for risk management, but \ndefinitely a part of the solutions. They should be considered as a part of a range of measures and \nactions from an integrated risk management perspective. However, NBS aiming to improve risk \nmanagement are still in an emerging phase.  \n2. Strategic opportunity areas \nThe implementation of NBS offers major opportunities. When NBS aim to prevent risk, they often \ncombine multiple functions and benefits: reduction of pollution, carbon storage, preservation of \nbiodiversity, recreational activities, and economic opportunities. Moreover, NBS may offer \nsynergies in reducing multiple risks (drought and floods, for instance) and meet the objectives of \ndifferent current regulations in Europe, for instance the Flood Directive and the Water Framework \nDirective. Also, they will contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Risk prevention \nparticularly needs multifunctional solutions. Why? Because investments in risk prevention generate \nlong term benefits from a statistical perspective (every 10, 30 or 100 years). In the short term, \nother kinds of regular benefits are required to ensure a massive involvement of politicians and \nprivate companies in the implementation and funding of such solutions. This is why multifunctional \nmeasures, such as NBS, are great opportunities in the field of risk management. Cities are \nparticularly concerned due to the high exposure of populations and activities to different kinds of \nrisks. The implementation of NBS so far has been slow since the evidence base needs to be built, \nnew approaches in integrating living systems with built systems (innovative combinations of soft \nand hard engineering) need to be developed and financial and institutional arrangements need to \nbe developed to create opportunities, incentives and legal frameworks. Of special interest would be \nto develop the methodology and empirical studies of the insurance value of ecosystems, i.e. the \nvalue of the sustained capacity of ecosystems to reduce risks to human society caused by natural \ndisasters. Promoting ecosystem-based solutions is in itself an innovative way to consider risk \nmanagement as an integrated approach, combining different scales and planning perspectives.  \n                                                 \n59 The classic definition of sustainable development focuses on how to manage resources in a way that \nguarantees equity and welfare of current and future generations, while resilience addresses the capacity of a \nsystem to absorb shocks and disturbances and undergo change in order to maintain approximately the same \nidentity. While sustainable development is inherently normative and positive, representing an overarching \ngoal for society, resilience is non-normative since it denotes a property of a system. The desirability or non-\ndesirability of resilience depends on careful analysis of resilience “of what, to what and for whom”. Further, \nresilience is an attribute of a system not of a locality, for example the concept of a resilient city is \nproblematic unless cities are viewed as open complex systems of systems extending over large spatial \nscales. To become meaningful, urban resilience has to address multiple scales, both below and above the \ncity scale. A too narrow focus on a single city scale may be counterproductive and even destructive, since \nbuilding resilience in one city often may erode it somewhere else with multiple negative effects across the \nglobe (Elmqvist, T. 2014. Urban Resilience thinking. Solutions, 5, 26-30). \n 34 \n \n3. Examples of Nature-Based Solutions \nToday, NBS aiming to prevent risks are implemented in different, often interconnected, areas, e.g. \nflooding along rivers (e.g. natural water retention measures, dyke relocation, re-naturing rivers, \nbuffering areas, restoration of wetlands, woodlands, floodplain, re-meandering), sea level rise and \nerosion in coastal regions (e.g. de-poldering, set back of estuarine defences, maintaining dunes \nand beaches, salt marshes), heat island effects in cities (e.g. multifunctional green public spaces, \nsustainable urban drainage systems), droughts in rural areas (sustainable agricultural practices \nand irrigation systems), landslides, avalanches and rockfalls in mountainous zones (reforestation, \nrainfall water management, torrents and river management), forest fires (resistant and resilient \nspecies, firebreaks management, human settlements regulation in mountain regions). \n4. Research & Innovation Actions \nx Developing a technical and scientific evidence base for NBS \n\u0010 Develop models for (1) calculating different scenarios of risk reduction for different types of \necosystems (2) analyzing the effects of restoring degraded lands on risk reduction taking \ninto account the ecosystem capacity (3) analyze the qualitative aspects of ecosystems \nneeded to sustain the insurance capacity of ecosystems (long-term capacities of \necosystems to reduce risks in terms of stability and resilience against climate change \nimpacts. \n\u0010 All models should include an explanation of uncertainties and integrate the distinction \nbetween fast and slow catastrophes. \n\u0010 Explore the capacity of NBS to simultaneously prevent different hazards. \n\u0010 Develop new innovative integration of living or bio-inspired systems with built designed \nsystems and implement such NBS within land use planning, integrating several scales.  \nx Developing decision support tools to foster the implementation of NBS \n\u0010 Develop protocols, standards, performance tools to assess the relevance of NBS in \neconomic, social, environmental and welfare terms. \n\u0010 Develop methodology to evaluate how multiple benefits are distributed between the \nstakeholders at different scales. \n\u0010 Develop methodology to assess the balance between short-terms and long-terms gains. \nx Developing financial instruments for NBS for risk management \n\u0010 Work with insurance companies to develop innovative ways for promoting NBS for risk \nmanagement e.g. pooling of insurance between towns/cities/regions, NBS linked to setting \ninsurance premiums and pay-outs. Develop a methodology to operationalize the concept of \nthe insurance value of ecosystems. Translate risk reduction capacity into value through, \ne.g. calculating benefit/investment ratios where benefits represent the reduced risk and \npotential lower premiums of property insurance policies. \n\u0010 Identify and adapt PES (payment for ecosystem services) schemes specifically designed for \nrisk management that would link upstream and downstream stakeholders. \n\u0010 Creating financial incentives to support NBS for risk management e.g. tax breaks, etc. \nx Developing new institutional and governance arrangements to facilitate NBS acceptance \n\u0010 Develop recommendations for governance and decision-making processes, including the \nissues of distributional effects and equity at different scales e.g. watershed scales and links \nbetween upstream and downstream, rural and urban areas. Indeed, often some NBS \nbenefits are not generated on site, but spill over into many places inside and outside the \narea where the NBS is implemented, beyond the administrative limits. \n\u0010 Design new ways to bring together key parties: local governments, investors, engineers, \ncompanies, researchers.  \n\u0010 Develop ways to involve local communities and stakeholders during decision-making \nprocesses. \n 35 \n \n\u0010 Assess the effectiveness of different current European regulations (for instance the Flood \nDirective or Water Framework Directive) to foster the implementation of NBS.  \n\u0010 Find ways to redirect and mobilize national defence resources to maintain and enhance the \ninsurance value of ecosystem. \n\u0010 Develop a new legal framework for insurance industry enabling the implementation of the \nconcept of insurance value of ecosystem. \nx Enhancing the visibility of NBS at every stage \n\u0010 In the field of research and education:  \no Build an accessible evidence base \no Build networks among research groups in Europe \no Explore the limits with new approaches of integrating living systems with built systems  \no Make available and accessible the literature review on NBS \no Develop educational curricula on NBS  \n\u0010 In the field of implementation: Develop demonstration sites and large-scale experiments to \ndemonstrate the relevance of NBS and communicate practical examples.  \n \n 36 \n \nANNEX 3: EVIDENCE BASE AND POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS \nIN NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS \nA suggested methodology for evidence-based policy making \nThe aim of nature-based solutions is to help societies address a variety of environmental, social \nand economic challenges. In this annex we examine how this can be done most cost effectively by \nefficient use of research and innovation. This process entails co-designing knowledge and the co-\nimplementation of results as an iterative process involving researchers, practitioners and other \nstakeholders.  \nResearch shows that conservation practitioners often make little use of the published evidence \n(just for 2.1% of decisions60) for a range of reasons, including most being behind paywalls, \nshortage of time and the challenges of extracting practical advice from academic papers. When the \nresults of research are presented in a palatable manner then it often results in changes in the \ndecisions they make61. \nA serious challenge is the mismatch between the policies and the evidence. The solution is to \nseparate the general objectives into specific interventions62. For example, the broad objectives of \ngreening cities to reduce pollution, noise and improve health and investment will actually be \nimplemented through a wide range of interventions, such as planting trees to reduce air pollution, \nencouraging green roofs and walls, creating attractive green spaces for exercise and restoring \nderelict land. Each of these can then be further separated. For example, there are a wide range of \nmeans for creating green roofs. It is then possible to use the evidence to assess the most cost-\neffective means of delivering these.  \nDelivering evidence-based nature-based solutions requires using the evidence to answer three key \nissues:  \ni. Is the proposed measure effective in addressing the problem? For example, how effective is \ntree planting in reducing air pollution? How does this differ between different tree species? \nHow does this differ between different spacing patterns?  \nii. What are the most effective means of establishing and maintaining the green solution? For \nexample, what is the success of the various means of establishing green roofs? \niii. How does the effectiveness change with local conditions? Many will vary according to the \nclimate, local ecology or societal variation.  \nThe challenge is then to systematically review the evidence, assess its relevance and quality, and \nthen make this available to practitioners.  \nWithout this accessible evidence base there is a serious risk that considerable funds will be spent \non activities that are not effective. This is well known in medicine, but there are also examples \nrelated to the natural environment. Similarly, for agri-environment schemes, for which €24 billion \nhad been spent between 1994 and 2002, the effectiveness was mixed, with 6% showing \ndecreases, 23% showing no change and 17% a mixed response63. Other examples include \nineffective interventions for the conservation of bats64,65;66, counter-effective habitat management \n                                                 \n60 Sutherland, W.J. et al (2004) The need for evidence-based conservation.

The first stage should be a collation of the possible interventions, with the objective of being \nas comprehensive as possible (e.g. Sutherland et al. 201471). These should be detailed, for \nexample, listing all the possible means of reducing flood risk through changes in land \nmanagement. A reasonably comprehensive list has already been made by the expert panel \n(see end of this Annex), but this needs some more work.  \n2. The interventions need to be prioritised according to the likelihood of being implemented, for \nexample, those that relate to urban environments are likely to be considered a priority. \n3. The published literature needs to be reviewed in a systematic and unbiased manner with the \nrelevance and quality of the evidence assessed. The extent to which local environmental or \nsocial conditions modifies effectiveness needs to be determined, so it is possible to produce \nlocal solutions to local conditions.  \n4. The results should be synthesised and presented to practitioners in a manner that can be \nused readily by a wide range of individuals, for example through existing web sites. In \neffect, this will result in an online resource provided recommended evidence-based practice \nfor different interventions under different conditions.  \nThe results of this assessment can then be used to direct research and innovation. Practitioners, \npolicy makers and researchers can then be brought together to identify the gaps in knowledge \nwhere the requirement of practitioners is poorly met by the scientific literature72,73. Innovation \nplays a critical role where satisfactory solutions are lacking or where existing methods can be \nimproved. The knowledge gaps can be targets for future research funding.  \nWe suggest that the proposals should be designed so that they test those promising interventions \nand innovations for which evidence is insufficient. The design should be scientifically rigorous with \nappropriate use of controls and sufficient replication. Randomised, replicated, controlled trials are \nthe strongest study designs for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions74,75. Sites treated with \nthe intervention must be compared with controls, which are either sites not treated with the \nintervention, or the same sites before the intervention is implemented compared with afterwards. \nSample sizes must be large enough to determine whether there is a significant difference between \ntreatment groups. Achieving large sample sizes is often impossible if the interventions need to be \ncarried out at separate sites, on threatened individuals or in protected areas. Therefore, the best \nstrategy is to replicate the experiment as many times as is feasible, given time and cost \nconstraints. Results from such studies can be fed back into the evidence base so improving further \npractice and ensuring that these experiences are shared widely within Europe, but also even more \nwidely through, for example, the growing global research community within Future Earth who are \napplying this approach76. \n                                                 \n67 Bailey, M.A. et al.

That, as a coordination and support action, the evidence on the effectiveness of key nature-\nbased solutions is systematically assessed as soon as possible, building on existing \ninitiatives. This should ideally be prior to the main projects being implemented to make the \nsubsequence action as effective as possible.  \n2. That the nature-based solutions are designed and implemented with the co-production of \nscientifically sound knowledge through multi-stakeholder engagement, so that the \nexperience gained is shared with others.  \nNature-based solutions – a preliminary list of possible interventions \nThe aim of this list (developed and extended from Sutherland et al., 201477) is to provide an initial \nclassification of the possible interventions that could be applied when constructing nature-based \nsolutions. This is simply those interventions that are used or have been suggested. Inclusion here \ndoes not mean they have been tested or shown to be effective.  \nAIR QUALITY REGULATION \nThis section considers interventions to maintain non-climate related services concerned with air \nquality, including the extraction of chemicals such as particulates and direct air contaminants, and \nthe emission of chemicals. \nForests \n1.

Some examples on urban policy and/or business initiatives that aim to promote \nnature-based solutions are also included. \nThe Big Tree Plant: urban street trees and community orchards \nTheme (s): Sustainable urbanisation, climate change adaptation and mitigation, risk reduction and \nresilience \nMeasures: planting of trees along streets and in other urban locations, particularly in economically \ndeprived areas \nShort description: The program is motivated by an appreciation of diverse ecological, social and \neconomic benefits provided by urban trees. Trees can help improve air quality and reduce energy \nconsumption by providing cooling shade in the summertime. They are an aesthetic amenity that \ncan support psychologically restorative experiences to residents both when outdoors and when \nindoors while looking out from their homes. Perhaps for these reasons, trees and other greenery \naround homes can boost property values. Tree planting and maintenance are understood as \ncommunity activities that get people out of the house and active, together with their neighbours. \nThe Big Tree Plant program seeks to plant 1 million trees within a period of 5 years (2011-2015). \nCosts & benefits: Costs include over 2 million GBP from the Forestry Commission and over 3 \nmillion GBP in matching funds. It is hard to give exact figures for monetary benefits, but relevant \nestimates are available. For example, potential health benefits can be realized via multiple \npathways, including air quality improvements, stress reduction, and increased physical activity. \nWillis and Crabtree (2011) estimate that the annual value of decreased morbidity and mortality \nfrom a 1% unit reduction in the percentage of sedentary people in the UK at 1.44 billion GBP, \nmuch of this due to reduced mortality from coronary heart disease. Tyrväinen and Miettinen \n(2000) applied hedonic price analysis to Finnish data to estimate that a dwelling with a view of \ntrees cost roughly 4.9% more than a similar dwelling without tree views.  \nLocation & partners: London and other communities in the UK; further information in reports \navailable at the website below. \nSources and further information:  \nx Forestry Commission, http://www.forestry.gov.uk/england-bigtreeplant  \nx Willis K, Crabtree B (2011): Measuring health benefits of green space in economic terms. \nIn Nilsson K, Sangster M, Gallis C, Hartig T, De Vries S, Seeland K, Schipperijn J.

These practices, which rely on natural processes like \nevaporation, infiltration, and plant transpiration, can effectively and affordably complement \ntraditional “grey” infrastructure, and provide a wide range of benefits. SuDS substantially reduce \nthe overall amount of water entering local storm sewers or surface waters and reduce flooding-\nrelated impacts,  \nCosts & Benefits: Reduced stormwater runoff and pollution, as well as energy and water treatment \ncosts, diminished impacts of flooding, improved public health, and reduced damages to public \ninfrastructure and associated repair costs and damages to private and public property, creating \namenity values in urban areas \nExamples:  \nx In the stormwater management programme in the City of Philadelphia: Philadelphia’s \nplan to reduce combined sewer overflows, calls for an investment of $2.4 billion over the next \n25 years in public infrastructure (Green City, Clean Waters). The net benefits of using surface \ntechniques has been estimated at almost $3 billion compared with less than $100 million for the \npiped alternative. The $3bn figure includes many diverse benefits such as: changes to property \nvalues; green jobs created; reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; and reduced crime (MWH \n2013).  \nx Retrofitting SUDS in an urban regeneration area, Augustenborg / Malmö (Sweden): \nThe total sum invested in the area added up to around SEK 200 million (€22 million). According \nto Rainwater run-off have decreased by half. The image of the area has improved. Biodiversity \nhas increased by 50 % (green roofs have attracted birds and insects and an open stormwater \nsystem provides a better environment for the local plants and wildlife. The impact on the \nenvironment decreased by 20 %. Unemployment rate has fallen from 30 % to 6 %. The \nturnover of tenancies has also decreased by 50 %. Key actors in this initiative include MKB \nhousing company, the City of Malmö as well as individuals (GRABS 2010) \nx In the case of “Severn Trent Water Ripple Effect investigation” city-wide benefits of \nretrofitting SuDS through the creation of green streets (not including the benefits relating to a \nreduction in the number of heat‐related deaths, and enhanced biodiversity and health) were \nquantified at £1.5 billion over 40 years. For the site at Stoney Road, there is a benefit of over \n£906,000 or 7.5 times the site costs of £121,000. If water reuse infrastructure was added to \nstore and recycle runoff locally for irrigation and toilet flushing, the benefits would increase \ndramatically to nearly £8.3 billion across the city and nearly £3 million at the site scale (AECOM \n& Severn Trent Water 2013; MWH 2013). \nLocation & partners: As identified in the examples above. \nSources and further information: \nx Aecom & Severn Trent Water (2013): The Ripple Effect - Building resilience of urban water \nsystems to climate change.

The Madrid Rio project restored the Manzares \nRiver and formed accompanying areas of open parkland, gardens and promenades. The Madrid Rio \nproject ably demonstrates the value in a bold approach to reclaiming urban space from roads to \nfashion multifunctional urban environments for people that are healthier, quieter and more \nbeautiful and can also promote economic benefits via tourism. B) Mayoral candidate Lee Myung-\nbak focused his mayoral election campaign on restoring the Cheonggyecheon River in Seoul. The \nriver was erased by a three-lane stretch of elevated highway creating one of the most congested \nand polluted areas of the city. Following his election the area was completely transformed with the \nreturn of the river bringing with it 3 miles of fresh running water with open space and tree-lined \npedestrian walkways. Summing up this transformation in his book “What Has Nature Ever Done for \nUs?”, the environmentalist Tony Juniper suggests it reflects a growing appreciation of the essential \nrole that green infrastructure and nature play in city design. \nCosts & Benefits:  \na. Decrease in noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and accident rates. Increase in \nquality of life (increased public space, paths and playgrounds for sports and leisure, \nincreased social cohesion, more efficient transport system), environmental benefits include \nincreased the creation of an ecological corridor and increased water quality. Greater \nmobility. The site has become a first class tourist attraction, and model for other cities. Cost: \nThe Calle 30 Project ~ € 3.7 billion. The Madrid Rio project € 370 million.  \nb. The park now attracts 64,000 visitors a day. Whilst the beauty of the park is a major draw, \nthis landscape lowers ambient temperatures to 3°C lower than the city average, land prices \nhave soared and biodiversity increased by 639% along this new blue-green corridor. Cost \nwas US $280million. \nLocation & partners: A) partners: municipality, citizens’ outreach program, public-private \npartnerships with Madrid businesses; B) Seoul, South Korea; Government funded, multi-partner \nproject \nSources and further information:  \nx http://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/RelacionesInternacionales/Publicaciones/\nCatalogoBuenasPracticasIngles/Townplanninginfrastructures/Madrid%20R%C3%ADo%20E\nNG.pdf \nx http://ecrr.org/Portals/27/Cheonggyecheon%20case%20study.pdf \nx http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/microsites/river/pdfs/cap13.pdf  \n 55 \n \nBiotope Area factor \nObjective/Theme: Sustainable Urbanisation \nSolutions/measures: Local regulation \nShort description: The city of Berlin has introduced an effective landscape programme. As a \nresponse to the shortage of green space in the city, Berlin developed the ‘Biotope Area factor \n(BAF)’ which is a regulation that measures the proportion of green space to the entire development \nto create more green space within densely built up urban locations. The BAF was formulated for \ninner-city districts of Berlin by a large number of experts who agreed on the necessary proportion \nof green space for different development types based on the layout of buildings. The key aim of \nthe BAF is to ensure that a given proportion of a particular site is left undeveloped, i.e., covered by \nvegetation. The strategy therefore aims to retain high densities of development whilst also \ndeveloping the city’s GI. Whilst the BAF has been introduced into spatial planning as a nature \nconservation measure, it also improves the microclimate, air quality and impacts of climate change \nsuch as the occurrence of heat and the risk of flooding from more intense rainfall. \nCosts & Benefits: increasing drainage capacity of urban soils, improved replenishment of the \ngroundwater, reduced pollution caused by run-off, prevention of urban flooding, reducing heat \nisland effect, recreation, provision of plant and animal habitats \nLocation & partners: Berlin and other partners.  \nSources and further information: \nx http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/landschaftsplanung/bff/index_en.shtml \nx http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/landschaftsplanung/bff/download/Auszug_B\nFF_Gutachten_1990_eng.pdf \n 56 \n \nThe MA 48’s Climate Facade \nObjective/Theme: CCAM, sustainable urbanisation \nSolutions / measures: to “green” a façade \nShort description: The goal of this project was to “green” the façade of a building of the Vienna \nMagistrate (“MA 48”), an area of 850m2 within four months, thereby creating ecological niches and \nhabitats for many kinds of insects and birds, and having positive effects on the surrounding indoor \nand outdoor climates. With this measure, a technical solution (e.g. air conditioning) can be \navoided, keeping energy consumption in check and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions and \naddressing inter alia the “heat island effect”. The project functions as a gateway for the \nimplementation of additional measures. In addition, a practical guide for façade greening was \ndeveloped. \nCosts & Benefits: climate regulation in the immediate area, carbon storage, habitat creation and \nnetworking, improved quality of life; measurements have shown that the building’s heat loss in \nwinter was reduced by up to 50%. The summer cooling through the “green skin” was equivalent to \nthat of about 45 air conditioning units (with 3000 watts and 8 hours of operation each) or four \n100-year-old beech trees, which would be required for the entire area of the building. \nLocation & partner: Vienna Magistrate (\"MA 48\"),University for Soil Science (BOKU Wien), local \npopulation \nSources and further information: \nx http://www.gruenwand.at/files/188_Seite_28_Fachzeitschrift_fuer_Architekten_04.2012x.\npdf \nx http://www.ecologic.eu/sites/files/publication/2014/eco_bfn_nature-based-\nsolutions_sept2014_en.pdf  \n 57 \n \nPlanting trees to reduce air pollution and improve health \nObjective/Theme: Air pollution is a serious problem with more people moving to towns and cities \ncombined with increased traffic.  \nSolutions/measures: There are a range of measures including the important one of reducing the \nsource of the pollution. It has become increasingly clear that appropriate tree planting can be \neffective in reducing levels of air pollution in urban areas.  \nShort description: Provide incentives to encourage the planning of lines of trees in areas where \nhigh densities of pollutants and people coincide  \nCosts & Benefits: The cost is in the planting of and caring for the trees. Tree species vary \nconsiderably in their capacity to reduce air pollution. Some trees species can even emit volatile \norganic compounds that can contribute to creating polluting gases so having a negative impact. \nResearch in the United States (Nowak et al 2014) assessed the health consequences of trees \nintercepting particulate matter and absorbing gaseous pollutants. Trees were estimated as \nreducing air pollution by 17.4 million tonnes (range: 9.0-23.2 million t) in 2010 with benefits \nincluding the avoidance of over 850 deaths and 670,000 incidences of acute respiratory symptoms, \nresulting in a saving of $6.8 billion (range: $1.5-13.0 billion). The benefit of trees for the Greater \nLondon Authority was estimated as removing between 852 and 2121 tonnes of particulate pollution \nannually (Tallis et al 2011), with greater contributions from coniferous species. Similarly for the \nWest Midlands McDonald et al (2007) estimated that PM10 levels could be cut by 19% by \nincreasing tree cover from 3.7% to 16.5%. In some cases there could be other benefits associated \nwith having trees in urban areas, for example by encouraging exercise, increasing well-being, \nencouraging investment into areas that have been made more attractive, reducing localised \nwarming and increasing biodiversity.  \nLocation & partners: This could be carried out in a wide range of urban areas where the multiple \nbenefits are greatest. The details have been shown to matter so there is a clear need for this \ncarried out based on the best available evidence, whilst also improving knowledge through \nexperimental practice. The partners could include transport authorities, local and national \ngovernment, health authorities, and businesses and others interested in local regeneration.  \nSources and further information: \nx Nowak, D.

This makes continued public expenditures \nunlikely and puts the surrounding 12,100 ha floodplain at risk. The aim of the project is thus to \ncombat the threats from climate change and coastal flooding by restoring 133ha mudflat, 29ha \nlagoons, 276ha salt marsh, 109ha coastal grazing marsh, 53ha saline lagoons, 15ha of rotational \narable fields (‘wild bird cover’). It will also help to address the ongoing regional flood risks. \nCosts & Benefits: The RSPB bears the majority of costs with additional funding coming from \nCrossrail, a joint venture between Transport for London and the Department for Transport, which \nwill deliver the waste material and carry out the majority of the construction work.  \nCosts (estimated) - over £5m. for land purchase on Wallasea Island; physical implementation \nworks of around £17.5m. Future work (possibly costing £12m. or more) to deliver and manage \nhabitats. Management and administration activities are estimated to be on the order of £190,000 \nannually. \nBenefits - Benefits identified included: habitat creation/compensation to compensate for losses in \nCrouch and Roach estuaries, flood protection to avoid the flood damage risks, allow 2Mm3 water to \nenter and leave on higher (i.e. ‘spring’) tides, increased flood storage, enhanced protection of the \nwest of the island, recreation e.g. fishing, socio-economic e.g. oyster beds, climate change \nmitigation (carbon sequestration) and adaptation. \nBenefits (estimated) - carbon sequestration £1.7 million over the next 50 years; avoided \nexpenditures for flood defence infrastructure over 10 years (ca. £5 – £10 million) and from the \navoided loss of built assets on Wallasea worth £3.1 million under moderate flood event scenarios; \n16.6 net jobs created in the local economy and up to 20.9 in the wider region over a 10-year \nperiod. \nLocation & partners: Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in cooperation with public \nauthorities (e.g. Environment Agency, UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), \ncontractors and landowners.  \nSources and further information: \nx eftec (2008): Wallasea Island Economic Benefits Study: Final report submitted to the East \nof England Development Agency. \nx RSPB and ABPMer (2008): Wallasea Island Wild Coast Project - creating a new coastal \nnature reserve.

In the Netherlands, where ten million people are exposed, this way to manage \nfloods was particularly developed until the end of the 20th century. The rise of awareness that this \nstrategy could lead to unbearable costs without a guarantee for people’s safety, as the 1993 and \n1995 floods showed, generated new political reflections. A new plan called “room for the river” was \nestablished and a new strategy emerged: making more space for water to better prevent floods by \nlowering the level of high water and to offer spatial quality to the area reconnecting people and \nrivers. Some measures of this plan are nature-based solutions. The city of Nijmegen is one of the \nareas where the programme took place. Nijmegen has been built on the south bank of the Waal \nriver. On the opposite side of the river, the city of Lent was protected by a dike which contributed \nto narrowing the river to form a bottleneck prone to flooding. The project involved two main \nmeasures: (1) the relocation of the dike 350 meters inland, (2) the digging of an ancillary channel \nin the floodplain enabling the creation of a new island. Both actions will make more space for the \nriver and for nature. \nCosts & Benefits: The cost of this ongoing project which has to be finished in 2016 is €359 million. \nIt offers multiple benefits. The first one is the reduction of the water level by 35 cm and therefore \nan improvement of risk management. This project brings also new potential for the development of \nthe city, by the creation of an urban river park with possibilities for recreation and nature. This \npark is thought of as the future heart of the city of Nijmegen. \nLocation & partners: 17 partners are carrying the national plan through the country: provinces, \nmunicipalities, water boards and the Rijkswaterstaat. The Ministry of Infrastructure and \nEnvironment is responsible for the implementation of the program. \nSources and further information: \nx http://www.ruimtevoorderivier.nl/english/  \n 60 \n \nThe Living Garden Concept  \nObjective/Theme: CCAM/risk reduction & resilience/sustainable urbanisation/restoration  \nSolutions / measures: The creation of green and sustainable spaces where water, soil, energy, \nbiodiversity and edible greenery are taken into account through training. \nShort description: In the recent years there has been a trend in fully paved gardens. Given climate \nchange and the effect on biodiversity this is not a desired development. Garden owners are open \nto more green gardens, but they do not know what kind of sustainable elements to bring in and \nthink that these cost more and require more maintenance. The concept of The Living Garden \nshows how to create green and attractive sustainable gardens. Gardeners use this concept in their \nrelationships with (potential) clients to advise them about green opportunities. The concept is now \nalso used by landscapers and landscape designers to create green public spaces. The concept of \nThe Living Garden is an initiative of the Dutch Garden and Landscape Contractors Association \n(Branchevereniging VHG). \nCosts & Benefits (Environmental, Social, Economic): The benefits of The Living Garden concentrate \non environmental aspects such as water retention, heat stress prevention and the stimulation of \nbiodiversity. Also the effect of greenery on people’s health must be taken into account. All \nmembers of the Dutch Garden and Landscape Contractors Association use the concept within their \nwork as much as possible. Thousands of practitioners have been trained in the meaning of the \nconcept and the way to apply it in private gardens and public spaces.

It provides that by 2020 land is managed sustainably in the EU, soil is adequately \nprotected and the remediation of contaminated sites is well underway and it commits the EU and \nits Member States to increasing efforts to reduce soil erosion, increase soil organic matter and to \nremediate contaminated sites. \nSoil decontamination is an expensive process depending on pollution types and site characteristics. \nAlthough a large variety of techniques for soil remediation are being commercialized by leading \nEuropean companies, very few of the current industrial techniques are environmentally friendly, \nrespecting the soil biodiversity and soil’s organic matter content. \nAcademic research and pioneering industrial projects demonstrated the effectiveness of bio-\ninspired technologies, replicating and simulating the ecosystem’s natural restorative capacity in \nsolving the most complex soil pollution situations, while enhancing the soil biodiversity and \nresilience. These technologies use the remarkable ability of some fungi to degrade recalcitrant and \nalso highly toxic molecules.  \nFungal bioremediation of soil relies on the industrial-scale production of fungal biomass upcycling \nlow valued organic waste that is subsequently applied to the contaminated soil. \nCosts and benefits: Fungal bioremediation technology opens innovative nature-based solutions for \nthe treatment of recalcitrant soil pollution, thus avoiding transportation cost to transnational \ntreatment and storage sites, as well as the use of energy costly and non-environmentally-friendly \ntechnologies. The scheme (a) offers a cost-effective rehabilitation of degraded land;(b) offers a \ncompetitive ecologically alternative; (c) provides an effective elimination of the pollution; (d) \nrestores and enhances the soil biodiversity and health; (e) recycles its main reactant (fungal \nbiomass); (f) cycles and valorizes low valued organic waste. \nLocations: Brussels, Belgium/ France / Helsinki Finland / Nederlands / USA \nSources and further information:  \nx H.

Thus, these \nvaluable habitats in the transitional area between land and sea - and eventually even entire islands \n- could be lost. The aim is to protect the Wadden Sea from destruction by sea level rise and \nthereby to protect the integrity of this world cultural heritage site in its entirety, which can only be \nachieved in cooperation with coastal protection. Several projects, case studies, and pilot measures \nwere launched.  \nCosts & Benefits: Improved ecosystem resilience, reduced flood risk, species and habitat \nconservation and increase in biodiversity, resilient infrastructure, improved pollution control, \nrecreation and benefits for tourism \nLocation & partner: World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Germany, Federal state of Schleswig-Holstein.

The first priority of the plan is flood protection, \nfollowed by restoration and the development of the protected nature of the Scheldt region, \nimproving the possibilities for recreation, and simultaneously taking account of the economic \nfunctions of the region (shipping, countryside economy). Finally, the Sigma Plan is developed in \nsuch a way that the disadvantages to agriculture are kept to a minimum. \nCosts & Benefits: The flood control area requires significantly more space. There is also some \neffect on local agriculture, but support measures are available to mitigate the effects on the \naffected farmers. Benefits comprise increased tourism and the restored wetlands form an excellent \nhiding and nesting place for various birds, In addition, mud flats and marshes form a natural buffer \nthat protects the population against floods: they collect sand and sludge, reducing the need for \ndredging. They further purify the water, and bring the natural food chain back into balance. \nLocation and partners: River Scheldt, Flanders, Belgium; Flemish Authority (W&Z) \nSources and further information:  \nx http://www.sigmaplan.be/en/  \n 66 \n \nBiobased geological CO2 storage  \nObjective: CCAM \nSolutions: the oxalate-carbonate pathway (OCP): turning sunlight into stone \nDescription: Biobased geological CO2 storage is a sustainable, bio-inspired solution for carbon \nsequestration, and an alternative or complementary way to existing Carbon Capture and Storage \n(CCS) techniques. Existing subterranean storage techniques, which consist of injecting high-\npressure gaseous CO2 into deep geological layers, are exposed to leakage risks and are very \nenergy demanding. The explored biological CO2 sequestration opportunity is the biomineralization \nof carbon by microorganisms, in particular the natural properties of some bacteria to combine \ncalcium and CO2 to produce calcareous rocks. A technology involving this carbonation process is \nconsidered sustainable and environmentally safe, as the CO2 is captured in a stable mineral \nstructure. Moreover, the project includes the aspects of valorization of the produced calcium \ncarbonate. \nCosts and benefits: The carbon sequestration potential of the OCP depends greatly on the tree \nspecies, the tree’s age and the availability of calcium in the tree's surroundings. On average up to \n21 kg of CO2 can be stored as CaCO3 per tree and per year. Hence an agroforestry project where \n200 “OCP trees” per hectares are planted could result in up to 4.2 tons of CO2 stored as CaCO3 per \nhectare, per year, in addition to the carbon stored as biomass (plants, soil organisms, decaying \norganic matter). More generally and when compared to “classical” reforestation schemes, the OCP \ntrees have the big advantage of fixing part of their carbon as limestone (carbon carbonate): if dead \ntrees eventually release CO2 during their decay (known as leakage in the REDD discussions), \nlimestone is stable in dry soils for at least thousands of years. Other side benefits: improvement of \nsoil fertility, thus positively impacting on the bio-availability of soil elements such as potassium, \nsodium, and potentially phosphorus; soil biodiversity; water retention. It presents also all the \nadvantages of forest preservation and reforestation, including their positive impact on water \nregulation and climate. Local economy and food security: the OCP-displaying tree ecosystems \ncould be used in agroforestry schemes to not only store carbon as mineral rock and biomass, but \nalso for wood production coupled with sustainable & local agricultural practices, for the benefit of \nlocal people.  \nLocation and partners: EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland – European Program CO2SolStock \nSources and further information:  \nx http://co2solstock.org/ \nx http://www.biomimicry.eu/nos-actions/le-projet-arbres-sauveurs/  \nx https://arbressauveurs.wordpress.com/ \n \n 67 \n \nANNEX 5: E-CONSULTATION ON NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS, \n12 NOVEMBER 2014  \nThe European Commission, in co-operation with the European Platform for Biodiversity Research \nStrategy (EPBRS)78, organised on 12 November 2014 an e-consultation as part of an ongoing \nmulti-stakeholder dialogue that contributes to framing a comprehensive EU Research & Innovation \npolicy framework for Nature-based solutions. Input to the e-consultation was developed by the \nHorizon 2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Four discussion \nsessions included: (a) Improved Risk Management and Resilience; (b) Restoration of Degraded \nEcosystems; (c) Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation; and (d) Sustainable Urbanisation.  \nMore than 330 participants, representing industry and SMEs, local to EU level governance, research \nand academia, as well as non-governmental organisations contributed actively to the discussions. \nThe results have fed into an ongoing consultation process, and more specifically the Stakeholder \nWorkshop 'Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities' (8 December 2014, Brussels). \nDuring the e-consultation, there was strong recurrence of certain themes across the different \ndiscussion sessions. More specifically:  \nx It was repeatedly stated that Nature-based solutions is still at the concept phase. Hence, the \ndefinition, as well as the relationship with other (related) concepts (e.g.: ecosystem \nservices, green infrastructure) and initiatives (e.g.: Millennium Ecosystems Assessment) need \nfurther clarification. A clear operational framework is needed. \n\"My advice is to clarify the term Nature-Based Solutions, explain the added value of Nature-\nBased Solutions and explain the differences with the Ecosystem Services concept. Avoid a new \nbuzz word that is again unclear“ \nx The need to adapt a broader holistic framework and thinking, to promote systemic \nsolutions and system resilience was frequently identified throughout the four sessions.  \n\"Need to identify means to implement Nature-Based Solutions other than through legislation\" \n\"Identify governance tools for long-term decision-making that  \nweighs human well-being, not just economic benefits\" \n\"Linking Public Health agendas with Nature Agendas\" \nx The need to think and work within a full multi-level stakeholder spectrum and perspective \nwas emphasised. All actions under nature-based solutions should involve all stakeholders, and \napply multi-level management, with a special focus on local communities. Community building \nwas identified as a key success factor. The challenges identified include maintaining a long-term \nperspective, integrating multiples values and ensuring risk acceptance by various stakeholders. \n\"Integrate research with management and society. Support adaptive management, adaptive \nresearch, participatory research, etc.\" \n\"My advice is to try and balance short-term wins with long term gains; it's important to keep all \nthe stakeholders engaged in the process. It's also critical to show tangible value wherever \npossible\" \nx A main common challenge for nature-based solutions, identified during the discussions, is to \nincrease awareness within a broader public, including policy, business, science and society. \nThis appeared all the more challenging to the participants given the unclear definition. \nCommunicating practical examples and education were considered fundamental. \n\"Explore how to best engage the community. Many successful Nature-Based Solutions are self-\nfunded initiatives that pay for themselves or voluntary sector aided\" \n                                                 \n78 Jurgen Tack (Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Brussels) organized the e-consultation on behalf of \nEPBRS; the Expert Group provided input, Florin Popa, Pierre Huybrechts and Estelle Ballian (Belgian \nBiodiversity Platform) contributed to the analyses; Allan Watt (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), along with \nthree experts from the Expert Group moderated the different sessions and the team of Synthetron provided \nthe technical platform and support. \n \n 68 \n \n\"Awareness raising through existing good business examples\" \n\"My advice is to consider the importance of education simultaneously to innovation – key to \nlong-term change and impact\" \nx There is an urgent need to make the business case for nature-based solutions. The economic \ndimension and opportunities were perceived by the participants –at this point in time- hard to \nidentify. Long-term perspective versus short-term profit, benefits of nature-based solutions, \nbusiness interest as well as difficulties with funding multi-purpose actions need to be addressed. \n\"The same standards will not be applicable - a new approach must be found\" \n\"Cost benefit analyses must be extended to also embrace non-economic values to ensure \nsustainability of decisions in the long-run.\"  \n\"As important as the HOW MUCH is the WHO: who benefits and who bears the costs\" \nThe complete report from the e-consultation on Nature-Based Solutions is available from: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index_en.cfm. \n \n 69 \n \n \nANNEX 6: STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP 'NATURE-BASED \nSOLUTIONS AND RE-NATURING CITIES', 8 DECEMBER 2014 \nThe Stakeholder Workshop 'Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities', held in Brussels on 8 \nDecember 2014, was part of an on-going multi-stakeholder dialogue which aims at contributing to \ndeveloping a Research & Innovation (R&I) agenda on Nature-Based Solutions (2014-2020). The \nobjective of the workshop was to encourage discussion on the most promising strategic opportunity \nareas for an EU R&I agenda on Nature-Based Solutions, as well as specific R&I actions required to \nachieve these opportunities. The workshop was attended by 61 participants. The discussions were \ndeveloped on the basis of preparatory work by the Horizon2020 Expert Group on 'Nature-Based \nSolutions and Re-Naturing Cities' and input from the e-Consultation on Nature Based Solutions, \nwith discussions focusing on four goals:  \nx Sustainable Urbanisation focused its discussions on resilient cities, health & well-being, and \nurban Living Labs.  \nx Discussions in the Restoration of Degraded Ecosystems session focused on using Nature-\nBased Solutions for regulating pollution and natural resource management, integration of urban \nplanning and land restoration, integrating sustainable agriculture and climate change adaptation \nand mitigation.  \nx The Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation session emphasised the need for a holistic \napproach and focused on the use of green infrastructure for protection from gradual (slow) \nclimate change impacts and from extreme weather events, and on bio-mimetic solutions. \nx Improved Risk Management and Resilience focused on extreme water level and prevention. \nThere was significant overlap across all four sessions. For example, urban issues and agriculture \nwere discussed within the context of all four goals/challenges. \nOverarching issues and plenary discussions resulted in the following conclusions: \nx Adopt an integrated and holistic regional landscape approach. There was an overall \nconsensus on the need to adopt an integrated and holistic urban/spatial planning approach. This \nis also the case for cities, which are not independent of the wider environment / landscape / \nseascape (and the people that live and work elsewhere). Programmes for research and \ninnovation on Nature-Based Solutions should therefore also address the interconnectedness and \nthe interdependencies between urban and non-urban areas (and people). \nx Innovate with \"living labs\" and diverse stakeholders. The idea of “living labs” for \ninnovation and experimentation on Nature-Based Solutions, both within and outside the urban \ncontext, was raised several times at the workshop. Such living labs can provide the ground for \ninter- and trans-disciplinary research and innovation; however the issue of interconnectedness \nwith the broader landscape should not be ignored. Nature-Based Solutions deliver benefits to \ndiverse stakeholders, hence the full stakeholder spectrum and their multiple values need to be \nconsidered. \nx Value the multiple benefits. The need for research and innovation on the valuation of the \nmultiple benefits of Nature-Based Solutions – also in the longer term, as well as into \nassessment tools was also a recurring message. Indeed, the valuation (monetary and non-\nmonetary) of the multiple benefits of Nature-Based Solutions and the development of \nperformance indicators, standards, technical and scientific reference models for Nature-Based \nSolutions is necessary for their wider and systemic implementation. \nx Create the suitable institutional and financial frameworks. Research and innovation into \ngovernance practices including decision-making processes, constraints and opportunities related \nto institutional and regulatory frameworks, as well as the development of new financial \ninstruments are all necessary to create a market for Nature-Based Solutions. \nx Map and build-on existing knowledge, and innovate. Research and innovation on Nature-\nBased Solutions should include novel approaches, while also learning from and building on \nexisting tools and methods, knowledge, databases and networks. Connecting existing networks \nas well as “learning by comparing\" are additional strategies that are recommended. \nThe complete report of the Stakeholder Workshop on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing \nCities can be downloaded from: http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index_en.cfm. \n 70 \n \n \nANNEX 7: BACKGROUND, AIMS & OBJECTIVES OF THE \nHORIZON 2020 EXPERT GROUP ON NATURE-BASED \nSOLUTIONS AND RE-NATURING CITIES \nThe Expert Group that collaborated for this report was formed in 2014 according to the provisions \nof the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014-2015, for Societal Challenge 5 \"Climate action, \nenvironment, resource efficiency and raw materials\". The Group was specifically formed to support \nthe European Commission with expert advice and analyses on past activities, assess policy relevant \nstate-of-the-art scientific knowledge and innovation, engage in forward looking reflection and \ncontribute to establishing a coherent EU Research and Innovation reference policy framework and \nagenda for Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities.  \nIn this framework, the Group worked on the following issues:  \nx Identification of the societal challenges to which nature-based solutions present the clearest \ncompetitive advantage - in terms of environmental, social and economic benefits - in terms of \nsustainability, cost-effectiveness, large-scale deployment, innovation and market potential, \navoidance of lock-in options;  \nx Development of an overview of the qualitative and quantitative evidence base of the benefits of \nnature-based solutions, and identification of systemic and knowledge gaps, which an EU R&I \npolicy framework initiative can help to bridge;  \nx Evaluation of the EU added value of a R&I nature-based solutions initiative, including \nopportunities for (further) up-scaling the current level of application and defining incentives to \novercoming legal, institutional, economic, cultural, behavioural, etc. barriers;  \nx Identification of relevant actors and stakeholders, and development of recommendations on an \neffective strategy to optimise engagement and mobilisation and promote innovation buy-in and \nup-take79. \nAs part of their work, the Group met three times, on July 16th 2014, October 3rd 2014 and January \n7th 2015. External expertise was drawn upon for the second meeting, and through larger \nconsultation initiatives. More specifically, experts from the Group were involved in an e-\nconsultation (November 12th 2014) and a Stakeholder workshop (December 8th 2014). The findings \nfrom these consultation processes were integrated in the recommendations produced by the Group. \n \n                                                 \n79 Further information on the activities, as well as on the Terms of Reference of the Horizon 2020 Expert Group \non Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities can be retrieved from: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3164  \n  \nHow to obtain EU publications \nFree publications: \n•  one copy: \n        via EU Bookshop (http://bookshop.europa.eu); \n•  more than one copy or posters/maps: \n        from the European Union’s representations (http://ec.europa.eu/represent_en.htm);  \n        from the delegations in non-EU countries (http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/index_en.htm);  \n        by contacting the Europe Direct service (http://europa.eu/europedirect/index_en.htm) or \n        calling 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11 (freephone number from anywhere in the EU) (*). \n         \n        (*) The information given is free, as are most calls (though some operators, phone boxes or hotels may charge you). \nPriced publications: \n•  via EU Bookshop (http://bookshop.europa.eu);  \n \n \n  \nK\nI-02-15-162-EN\n-C\n \n \n \nNature-based solutions simultaneously provide environmental, social and \neconomic benefits by bringing more nature and natural features and processes \ninto cities, landscapes and seascapes. \nThe Horizon 2020 Expert Group on 'Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing \nCities', chaired by Dr. Wilhelm Krull, Secretary General of the Volkswagen \nFoundation, was established under the 2014 Work Programme for the Societal \nChallenge “Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials”. \nDr. Pam Berry, Senior Research Fellow at Oxford University, rapporteur, and 12 \nother renowned experts, engaged in forward-looking reflection on future \norientations for EU Research and Innovation for nature-based solutions and re-\nnaturing cities.

A crucial, yet underexplored benefit, is the role that UGI can play in poverty alleviation. Acknowledging this role raises questions as to how UGI design and management can better provide opportunities for poverty alleviation and how it varies across UGI types and contexts. We consider this, using South Africa as an example, for five dimensions of poverty alleviation, namely (i) contributions to cash or non-cash income; (ii) increased opportunities for skills development and learning; (iii) improved physical and mental health; (iv) lessening of vulnerability and risk, and (v) increased opportunities to participate in decision-making. We do this for six types of UGI (amenity spaces, blue infrastructure, natural/semi-natural lands, urban parks, urban agriculture, and verges). We collectively ranked the current and future potential for poverty alleviation and the extent of change required to achieve the ranked potential for each UGI type. Urban agriculture was scored as having the highest current potential to contribute to poverty alleviation, and verges the least. In contrast, the ranking indicates that adopting pro-poor designs and principles will have the greatest returns per effort in parks and amenity spaces. But the widespread distribution and large extent of verges make them key areas for pro-poor interventions. Overall, we found that greater investment and changes in attitudes of authorities would have the greatest impact in poverty alleviation in all types of UGI, rather than policy and procedures around UGI design and management. We conclude that although the various types of UGI have markedly different potentials to contribute to poverty alleviation, there are some overarching strategies that planners and managers could adopt to promote poverty alleviation through UGI design and management.",

UGI type Brief description Natural & semi-natural spaces Typically, large (but not always so) green areas dominated by natural or semi-natural vegetation, with relatively low levels of transformation and relatively extensive (as opposed to intensive) management (e.g. forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, abandoned or ruderal areas, as well as those with limited vegetation such as sand dunes and rocky areas Parks & public gardens Multifunctional green spaces of varying sizes, ranging from pocket parks to large botanical, historical and recreational gardens Amenity spaces Public institutional green spaces designed or managed with an overriding key purpose, for example, sports fields/grounds, playgrounds, clinic and school gardens, cemeteries Verges Continuous or discontinuous strips of vegetation, hedges or trees along roads, streets, pathways, trails, railways, canals, waterways, streams Urban agriculture Public, collective or individually managed land parcels to provide regularly harvested products (e.g. crops, flowers, fruits, timber, biofuels, animals) for home use or sale Blue infrastructure Permanently or seasonally inundated water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, estuaries, oceans, dams, wetlands, bogs, fens, canals, bioswales 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Spatial planning at city and neighbourhood scales 3.2. Planning and management at individual UGI space scale Table 2. A conceptual assessment, based on the South African context, of the potential of six types of UGI to contribute to alleviating five dimensions of poverty against the relative effort required to realise that potential (see methods for ranking approach and values).

One of the most important benefits of ecosystems is public health promotion\n3\n. Such ecosystems include gardens, urban parks, rangelands, and forests covered with trees, shrubs, and grasses\n4\n, acting as a health clinic promoting public health\n5\n. Ecosystems actually treat humans, as a functional component of ecosystems\n6\n. Nature provides an opportunity to restore the human psyche because human interaction with the natural environment has features that are less common in interaction with the other environments\n7\nand to improve human quality of life\n8\n.\nIn fact, there is robust evidence that exposure to natural outdoor environments benefits mood\n9\nand makes people feel good\n7\n. Health does not only mean the absence of diseases or infirmity, but also physical, spiritual, mental and social well-being\n7\n. Stress, depression, and family and social anomalies are common problems, increase public health expenditures in recent years. Although human health has often been dealt with in terms of physical, mental, and social dimensions\n10\n, little is known about the relationship between ecosystems and social\n11\nand spiritual health\n12\n. As natural environments have a lower level of stressful architectures than man made environments, they take humans away from daily chores and force them to discover and improve their spiritual health\n13\n. Some believe that indicators of spirituality go beyond simple material existence including the sense of being human and the supremacy of the connection of nature or divinity (and values) such as love, compassion, and justice\n14\n. The results of studies revealed the importance of nature for people's health; physical activities improve mental health by improving behavior and improve social health by improving social relationships\n15\n. However, there are studies that did not find a significant relationship between nature and human health\n16\n.\nIn recent years, urban growth has increased with the increase in the world population\n17\n. Evidence shows that human impacts on ecosystems are growing\n18\n. Ecosystem degradation threatens public health in the future\n19\n. Constant exposure to artificial environments leads to fatigue, decreased vitality and health\n20\n. Many urban forests are shrinking and being replaced by parks\n21\n, so that lack of access to nature has become a serious concern worldwide\n22\n.\nEcosystem management faces to important challenges: whether man-made green spaces can provide all aspects of human health? and to what extent they can be considered as an alternative to natural ecosystems\n23\n. There is still a very important gap in scientific research regarding the health benefits of natural and artificial ecosystems\n24\n. It is very difficult to study the benefits of natural and artificial environments due to their complex ecological characteristics\n25\n,\n26\n. It is not yet clear what ecological factors are important for maximizing health benefits of the environment\n25\n. Understanding people's perceptions of ecosystems is one way to understand the importance of natural and artificial ecosystems for human health\n27\n. People have different theories about natural and artificial ecosystems\n28\n. Distinctive ecological indicators of natural and artificial ecosystems encourage people to choose them to visit\n29\n.\nThe distinctive indicators of ecosystems are related to the composing elements of ecosystems that discriminate an ecosystem from another one\n30\n. It is necessary to determine the power of the impact of important ecological indicators on health in order to determine the role of natural and artificial environments on public health. Past studies addressing the importance of ecosystems for human health have paid less attention to the socio-economic characteristics of individuals in social systems and the prevailing demands\n3\n. In order to determine the importance of ecosystems for public health, the needs of people in social systems must also be considered, because there are people with diverse socio-economic characteristics with very different health demands in the social systems\n31\n. Former studies are usually focused on one or two health dimensions\n9\n,\n11\n,\n12\n, while there are 5 different dimensions influencing public health (i.e. physical, mental, environmental, social, and spiritual). Both the health benefits of ecosystems and the health demands of social systems should be considered simultaneously in sustainable management. There is a long way to adequately quantify the relationships between health benefits of different ecosystems and social health’ needs. Filling these gaps may help the decision makers to balance the artificial and natural ecosystems based on people health’ demands. Knowing the most important ecological drivers of public health dimensions can also guide managers for improving artificial ecosystem characteristics related to public health promotion. Therefore, this study aimed to determine\n1\nthe most important ecological indicators in the ecosystem and the most important socio-economic indicators in social systems,\n2\nthe effect of the most important ecological indicators on public health in terms of physical, mental, spiritual, social and environmental health,\n3\nthe potential of natural and artificial ecosystems for physical, mental, spiritual, social and environmental health, and\n4\npublic health needs in the social systems.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area\nThis study was conducted in Jiroft county, which is located in south east of Iran (28 40 13 N and 57 44 13 E). Jiroft city is located on the flood plains. The city covers an area about 522 square kilometers with mean elevation of 650 MASL and mean annual rainfall of 191 mm. The climate is dry. According to the 2011 census, the population of the city was 277,748. The city-level literacy rate is 80% and the unemployment rate is 30%; the population has doubled over the past 20 years\n32\n. The area under cultivation of horticultural crops is 52,000 hectares with a production rate of 739,000 tons. Citrus and date orchards are among the most important orchards in the city. There are eight parks and green spaces in the city. National Garden Park with an area of 15,000 square meters is the smallest and Shahid Daliri Park with an area of 130,000 square meters is the largest. Natural rangeland and forest ecosystems are located at 2511 m above sea level. Jiroft county includes 234 thousand hectares of forests, of which\nJuniperus excelsa, Amygdalus lycioides\nand\nPistacia atlantica\nare the dominant forest species.\nArtemisia aucheri\nand\nAstragalus spp.\nare the dominant species of rangelands (Fig.\n1\n).\nFigure 1\nSource\n: Mapped by the authors using ArcGIS Desktop V. 10.8.\nThe location map of study area and its different land uses in Jiroft county, Iran.\nFull size image\nThe impacts of ecosystems on public health\nThe impacts of both natural and artificial ecosystems on public health were examined in this study. Rangelands and forests of the study area were considered as natural ecosystems. Urban parks and private gardens were selected as artificial or manmade ecosystems. Psychophysical methods were used to study the impacts of ecosystems on public health. These methods rely on people's perception of the nature by emphasizing landscape features\n33\n. The output of these models is usually used for management planning\n34\n. To do so, participants were asked to rank their own preferences on a scale of 1 to 10. Score 1 denotes low value and score 10 denotes very high value\n33\n. Forty-six indicators were chosen to assess five public health criteria (physical, mental, spiritual, social and environmental health) (\nAppendix A\n). Twenty-eight ecological indicators were selected to assess the impacts of ecosystems on public health based on the literature (\nAppendix B\n).\nIn this study, 185 participants were selected by non-proportional quota sampling method, of which 60% were urban and 40% were rural. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire had four separate sections. The first section included questions about the demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, place of residence, income, degree of dependence on the environment, occupation, etc.). The second section addressed the potential of different natural and artificial ecosystems for public health. Therefore, the respondents were asked to rank the potential of different natural and artificial ecosystems in terms of 46 mental, physical, environmental, spiritual and social health indicators. In the third section, the respondents were asked to rate the 28 ecological indicators based on their impacts on mental, physical, environmental, spiritual and social health. In the fourth section, the respondents were asked to rate the importance of 46 mental, physical, social, spiritual, social and environmental health indicators for their own health.\nData analyses\nLogistic regression was used to examine natural and artificial ecosystems in relation to health and ecological indicators. Logistic regression models are frequently used in ecology for exploring the most important environmental factors\n35\n. Logistic regression is an appropriate approach for analyzing hypotheses about the relationships between a categorical outcome variable and categorical predictor variables\n36\n,\n37\n. In its general form, the logistic regression model can be expressed as follow:\n$${\\text{log}}(\\frac{{p}_{i}}{1-{p}_{i}})={\\beta }_{0}+{\\beta }_{1}{{X}_{i1}+{\\beta }_{2}{X}_{i2}+{\\beta }_{3}{X}_{i3}+\\dots +{\\beta }_{n}{X}_{in}+\\varepsilon }_{i}$$\nwhere pi is the mean of a binary variable, X\ni\nis health indicator or ecological indicators for determining the ecosystem potential in providing health benefits. β is a vector of parameters to be estimated; and εi is the error term.\nThe coefficient of the model (\nβ\n) is used as the probability ratio to interpret the relationship of each of significant factors in each model\n36\n. The probability ratio indicates the change rate of the dependent parameter in relation to the independent variables.\nP\n-values below 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as statistically significant was considered for β in each model\n38\n.\nRelationships between ecological indicators and public health were assessed by Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity based on the PaST software (version 4.03)\n39\n. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to test associations between the number of ecological indicators\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\nof and physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health for NMDS axes to extract the most important ecological indicators. There are complicated relationships between ecological indicators. Hence, the path analysis model was used to reveal multivariate relationships between ecological drivers of public health resulted from NMDS. Path analysis is a generalization of multiple regressions that the strength and sign of directional relationships can be estimated for complicated relations with multiple dependent variables\n40\n. Path coefficient (ß) is the standardized slope of the regression of the dependent variable on the independent variable in the context of the other independent variables. Standardization was done to put different variables on the same scale. The influence of independent variables through both direct and indirect paths can be assessed in this method\n41\n. The chi-square test was performed to test the fit of the models which indicated a high goodness of fit for all five the models (0.10 ≤ X\n2\n≤ 2.00; 0.05 <\np\n≤ 1).\nEthical approval and consent to participate\nAll experimental protocols were approved by Review Board of Faculty of Natural Resources, University of Jiroft, Iran. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nResults\nThe participants’ demographic characteristics are given in Table\n1\n. 41% were young and 59% were adults. 47% had medium income. 51% had moderate social activity and only 15% were highly income dependent on ecosystems. NMDS showed that age and residency place were also important social characteristics affecting public health (\np <\n0.05, Table\n1\n).\nTable 1 Socio-economic characteristics of respondents and their correlation with the first two axes of NMDS.\nFull size table\nThe probability ratios of health indicators in relation to different ecosystems were estimated (Table\n2\n). Reducing feelings of anxiety and worry was important health indicator for rangeland ecosystems. The odd of rangeland important will increase 2.53 times higher when this indicator is taken into account. The most important health indicators related to forest was increase oneness with nature. The odd of forest important will increase 2.68 times higher when this indicator is taken into account. Increase social justice was the most important health indicator for park ecosystems. The odd of park important will increase 2.68 times higher when this indicator is taken into account. The most important health indicators related to garden decreased obesity. The odd of garden important will increase 1.89 times higher when this indicator is taken into account. Potential of ecosystems in providing physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health was shown in Fig.\n2\n. However, forest and rangeland ecosystems were more successful in providing environmental health, park ecosystem was more successful in providing physical health. Least potential for supplying public health was belonged to garden ecosystem. Social values of physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health for rural and urban people were assessed (Fig.\n3\n). Physical health was important for adults but mental health was important for younger ones.\nTable 2 Odds ratios of the best logistic regression models for different ecosystems (rangelands, forests, parks and gardens) and health indicators.\nFull size table\nFigure 2\nYoung, adult urban and rural participants’ need in terms of physical, mental, environmental, social and spiritual health.\nFull size image\nFigure 3\nPotential of different ecosystems (\na\n: forests,\nb\n: rangelands,\nc\n: parks and\nd\n: gardens) in providing physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health.\nFull size image\nThe probability ratios of ecological indicators in relation to each of the natural and artificial ecosystems were estimated (Table\n3\n). Wilderness and trees were the most important ecological indicators related to rangeland and forest ecosystems respectively. Element harmony and tree also were the most important ecological indicators related to park and garden ecosystems respectively.\nTable 3 Odds ratios of the best logistic regression models for four ecosystems (rangeland, forest, park and garden) and ecological indicators.\nFull size table\nResults of NMDS showed that easy to access was strongly correlated with the first axis of NMDS based on physical health (\np <\n0.01, Table\n4\n). Peaceful and silent place and aesthetic were strongly correlated with the first axis of NMDS based on mental health (\np <\n0.01). Wilderness was strongly correlated with the first axis of NMDS based on environmental health (\np <\n0.01). Aesthetic was strongly correlated with the second axis of NMDS based on spiritual health (\np <\n0.01). Providing shelter and easy to access were strongly correlated with the first axis of NMDS based on social health (\np <\n0.01, Table\n4\n). The standardized total effect of each ecological driver on physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health was obtained using the direct and indirect effects of drivers (Fig.\n4\n). Relationships between ecosystems and people health were revealed based on a framework (Fig.\n5\n). There are natural and artificial ecosystems with different ecological characteristics which have different values for physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health. In social system, there are people with different demographic characteristics who need different physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health. This framework can help managers to identify the most important health needs in social systems and what ecological indicators should be improved to meet the needs.\nTable 4 Correlation of ecological indicators with the two first axes of NMDS for physical, mental, social, spiritual and environmental health.\nFull size table\nFigure 4\nDirect, indirect and total standardized impacts on physical, mental, environmental, spiritual and social health based on Path way analysis.\nFull size image\nFigure 5\nThe framework for linking ecosystems to public health in social system. Arrows show significant relationships.\nFull size image\nDiscussion\nThe most important ecological indicators and socio-economic characteristics for public health\nIn this study the most important ecological indicators associated with public health were identified. Knowing these indicators will help managers to identify and protect important ecosystems for public health. Wilderness was the most important ecological indicator for public health. Therefore, natural ecosystems are more important to human health than artificial ecosystems. Biodiversity (animals and plants) was one of the most important ecological indicators related to public health. The results were consistent with Fuller et al.\n42\n. Marselle et al.\n43\nwho showed that bird diversity is effective in health but plant diversity had no significant effect on health. Biodiversity also indirectly has a positive effect on public health by promoting medicinal and nutritional resources, and clean air\n44\n,\n45\n. In park design, natural elements are usually more valuable than artificial elements\n46\n. Tzoulas et al.\n47\nshowed that in the construction of urban parks, vegetation should be selected in a way that increases biodiversity to achieve both the goals of ecosystem sustainability and public health.\nPlace of residence (urban and village) and age were two important social characteristics that had the greatest impact on health. Shi et al.\n48\nshowed that age is an influential factor for access to green spaces for urban people. All aspects of health were more important to urban people than to rural people, which indicates the higher needs of urban health for ecosystems. Public health is at greater risk in urban areas due to substandard housing, polluted water, polluted air, congested traffic, unhealthy food, and large populations\n49\n. Our results indicated that physical health was important for adults and young people were more sensitive to mental health. Past results also show that mental health concerns are for younger people aged 16–24\n50\nand physical health is usually important for older people\n51\n.\nSocial health was higher for the urbanites than for the villagers and higher for the urban adults than for the young. Former studies have also shown that meeting social needs and social support is essential to improving the health of older people\n52\n. Places with greater social cohesion usually have higher levels of health\n53\n. Usually the villagers are more in touch with their families and relatives and have more social interactions. So, social health is provided within the village. People who have high levels of social relationships and good relationships with their families are mentally and physically healthier\n52\n. Urbanites usually have more limited social relationships\n54\n. Therefore, they have a greater demand for social health and green space provides a good environment for their social rallies or social relations. Given that the growth rate of older people in cities is expanding\n55\n, paying attention to the demand of physical and social health is the most important dimension of health for urban societies. Environmental health was more important for the villagers, as they are more satisfied with their living environment, which is close to natural environments and they have more respect for nature\n56\n. On the other hand, the dependence of rural people on their natural environments has increased the importance of environmental health for them\n2\n,\n57\n.\nInteraction of natural and artificial ecosystems with the public health needs in the social systems\nTo determine the potential of natural and artificial ecosystems in meeting the needs of public health in the social systems, the direct and indirect effects of ecological indicators on five dimensions of health (mental, social, physical, spiritual and environmental) were identified. Easy access and aesthetic were important indicators of the environment that have the greatest impact on human physical health. A number of previous studies have shown the importance of accessible and air-conditioned green space for physical activity (such as walking, cycling)\n58\n.\nWilderness was the most important ecological indicator affecting mental, environmental and spiritual health. Natural forest and rangeland ecosystems were more successful in providing mental health than artificial ecosystems (parks and gardens). Franz et al.\n59\nalso showed that people psychologically prefer natural ecosystems to manmade ecosystems. Findings showed that stress reduction was the most important psychological indicator that affected people's mental health. Experience in natural environments not only reduces stress but can also help cure physical diseases\n60\n.\nScenic aesthetic is also an important factor that has a significant impact on the choice of places to visit\n61\n,\n62\n. The experience of beauty is determined by the combination of separate elements that the value of the elements is not the same\n63\n. People often judge ecosystems based on what they see\n64\n. People usually feel good about beautiful ecosystems\n65\n. Beautiful environments are not necessarily required to reduce stress, sometimes normal landscapes of green spaces in urban areas reduce stress as much as beautiful environments\n66\n.\nPeople who have a lot of access to green spaces are 3.3 times more physically active than those who live in areas with minimal green spaces. They were healthier than others due to more activity\n67\n. According to the findings, the urban parks were the most important ecosystem for physical health. Walking, running and cycling were the most important indicators of physical health that were provided due to easy access to the parks. Previous studies have also shown a significant relationship between green space and physical activity of cycling\n68\n. After the parks, the forests had the greatest impact on physical health. The reduction of respiratory and heart diseases was the most important indicator of physical health provided by the forest environments, which can be attributed to the clean air of forest ecosystems\n69\n.\nEasy access was also the most important environmental indicator for social health, and urban parks had the greatest impact on social health. In places where people feel safe and comfortable to walk, a positive perception of social cohesion is seen and interest in using green space increases\n70\n. Presence or access to urban green spaces increases social cohesion\n71\nand are a good place for social rallies\n72\n.\nBiodiversity can also be one of the most important reasons for choosing a place to have fun\n73\n. Few studies have examined the relationship between species diversity and mental health. Fuller et al.\n42\nshowed a positive relationship between species richness in ecosystems and the psychological benefits to human societies. Understanding biodiversity can increase the psychological well-being of human societies\n74\n. In this study, bird diversity was the most important indicator that affected mental health. Bird singing is often seen as a pleasant feeling\n75\n. Exposure to the sound of natural environments reduces stress and heart rate\n76\n. Birds' sounds have different effects on stress resort\n77\n. However, exposure to urban noises with auditory and non-auditory effects endangers human health\n78\n. Sound produced in cities is seen as a \"waste product\" that reduces human hearing\n79\n.\nSpecies diversity was also the most important ecological indicator affecting environmental health because people are able to understand the distinction between species-rich and species-poor communities in ecosystems\n80\n. People tend to conserve biodiversity-rich ecosystems and do not feel good about changing the use of these ecosystems\n81\n. Biodiversity provides human access to reliable food, clean water and raw materials\n82\n.\nBiodiversity loss has a major impact on the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable people\n83\n. Therefore, biodiversity is an important ecological indicator for environmental health. Aesthetic was also the most important environmental indicator affecting spiritual health and natural ecosystems played a more important role in spiritual health than artificial ecosystems. People's spiritual connection with nature has been reported in a number of previous studies\n84\n,\n85\n. Seeing nature inspires our superhuman strength\n86\n.\nAmong natural ecosystems, forests had a greater impact on different dimensions of health than rangelands. The two most important indicators of natural ecosystems i.e. biodiversity and aesthetic, which have the greatest impact on health, are higher in forests than in rangelands. Past studies have also shown that forests are more beautiful than rangelands\n87\n. The tree is a symbol of prosperity and an indicator of greenery and freshness, and a symbol of life. In arid and semi-arid areas, forests are usually more popular to visit because of the shade they provide. Forest trees have a positive effect on bird diversity by providing a good place for nesting and feeding\n88\n. Among the artificial ecosystems, parks were more effective than gardens in influencing public social and physical health because easy access, which was the most important indicator for artificial ecosystems in health, was provided by parks. But gardens are private property that are not open to the public.\nConclusion\nIn this study, the multidimensional health benefits of ecosystems were investigated. Natural and artificial ecosystems were successful in different dimensions of health. Urban and rural people also had different health demands. However, health benefits of ecosystem and social health demands were matched in the rural areas. There was a necessary to improve the artificial ecosystems in providing mental health in the urban areas. The ecological indicators were linked to different aspects of health to help decision makers to enhance ecosystem weaknesses in providing different dimensions of health. Mental health can be improved by strengthening silence and aesthetic aspects of artificial ecosystems based on our results. In general, understanding the potential of ecosystems in meeting people's needs for different aspects of health and understanding ways to strengthen ecosystems in providing multiple health benefits help policymakers for the conservation/ development of different ecosystems.\nData availability\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nReferences\nElwell, T.

However, knowledge of the qualities and requirements of such spaces and structures for the effective delivery of the range of ecosystem services expected is still limited, as well as the identification of trade-offs between services. In this study, we apply the One Health approach in the context of green spaces to investigate how urban park characteristics affect human mental health and wildlife support outcomes and identify synergies and trade-offs between these dimensions. Here we show that perceived restorativeness of park users varies significantly across sites and is mainly affected by safety and naturalness perceptions. In turn, these perceptions are driven by objective indicators of quality, such as maintenance of facilities and vegetation structure, and subjective estimations of biodiversity levels. The presence of water bodies benefited both mental health and wildlife. However, high tree canopy coverage provided greater restoration potential whereas a certain level of habitat heterogeneity was important to support a wider range of bird species requirements. To reconcile human and wildlife needs in green spaces, cities should strategically implement a heterogeneous green infrastructure network that considers trade-offs and maximizes synergies between these dimensions.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nObjective greenness, connectedness to nature and sunlight levels towards perceived restorativeness in urban nature\nArticle\nOpen access\n24 October 2023\nApplying an ecosystem services framework on nature and mental health to recreational blue space visits across 18 countries\nArticle\nOpen access\n06 March 2023\nMapping the benefits of nature in cities with the InVEST software\nArticle\nOpen access\n21 June 2021\nIntroduction\nMental health has become a growing concern worldwide after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial estimates show up to 28% increase in cases of mental disorders\n1\n. Globally, in comparison to their rural counterparts, urban dwellers show higher rates of anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders, a phenomenon called urban psychological penalty\n2\n, which is partially associated with characteristics of the physical environment\n3\n,\n4\n. Nature has increasingly been acknowledged for its beneficial effect on human health and well-being and, more recently, “green prescription” has emerged as a nature-based health intervention typically designed to tackle non-communicable diseases and mental health issues through the exposure of patients to natural environments\n5\n. Even in anthropic environments, studies have demonstrated that urban nature (i.e. urban green infrastructure) affects mental health and well-being in terms of stress reduction\n6\n, mental restoration\n7\n, life satisfaction\n8\n, lower depression risk\n9\nand anxiety prevalence\n10\n. However, evidence on the impact of urban green infrastructure quality, in terms of green space characteristics, in the provision of mental health benefits is still limited and dominated by findings from Europe, North America, and Asian countries\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n.\nUrban green infrastructure can also play a relevant role in biodiversity conservation when sustaining significant plant and animal species and functioning as stepping stones and corridors for wildlife\n14\n. Support to urban wildlife, defined as non-domestic animals located in human-dominated and non-agricultural areas\n15\nis affected by green space quality as aspects such as area, habitat diversity, and tree species richness have already been reported as predictors of animal diversity\n16\n,\n17\n. The knowledge of how animals respond to different characteristics of urban green infrastructure is essential to guide minimal requirements for green space design and management, avoiding the collection of “green deserts” dominated by mowed lawn areas that do not promote wildlife conservation\n18\n.\nBeyond the multifold benefits of green spaces to humans and biodiversity, the effect of biodiversity levels on human health and well-being outcomes has also been explored. Although studies have found mixed results, there is some initial evidence of a positive relationship\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n. Nonetheless requirements for human use and wildlife support may differ and a green space might not fulfill the demands for both dimensions at the same time. With the constant pressure on remaining green areas due to the increasing urban population and associated household and infrastructure developments, there is a need for multifunctional green spaces that maximize synergies and manage trade-offs between people and nature. For such, interdisciplinary studies on the role of green space quality on outcomes for both dimensions are necessary.\nIn this study, we examine the indirect effect of urban park qualities on the perceived restorativeness of users, as well as their direct effect on wildlife support metrics. We hypothesize that among synergies, some park characteristics, especially vegetation-related, may show opposite effects on humans and animals due to, for instance, local safety issues.\nTheoretical framework\nThe relationships explored here are based on the One Health framework for urban green spaces\n12\n, which aims at understanding the interlinkages between the green space quality (environmental health), users’ mental health and well-being (human health), and support to urban wildlife (animal health). The focus is to investigate whether green spaces’ characteristics affect outcomes for each dimension and, especially, to identify potential synergistic effects to be maximized and trade-offs to be managed in order to inform the design and management of multifunctional green spaces.\nFor this study, we selected urban parks as the green space type as they are freely accessible to the general population. From the multiple pathways linking green spaces to human mental health and well-being\n22\n,\n23\nwe focus on the restorative experience. According to the Attention Restoration Theory, it is the capacity to recover the directed attention that may become depleted in daily life and may lead to impaired performance and stress response\n24\n. Perceived restorativeness is a known mediator in the relationship between settings experience and well-being outcomes\n19\n, and it is usually associated with natural environments\n25\n. Characteristics of the setting may indirectly affect its restorative potential through users’ perceptions of how natural the place looks like (naturalness), the pleasantness of sounds they can hear (soundscape), the maintenance of facilities and vegetation (management), and how safe they feel during the visit (safety)\n12\n(Fig.\n1\n). Similarly, several environmental characteristics are known to potentially affect the capacity of green spaces to support urban wildlife populations (wildlife support)\n26\n. Support to wildlife populations can be assessed through metrics such as diversity estimates\n12\n.\nFigure 1\nTheoretical framework depicting the relationships investigated in this study. Modified from Felappi et al.\n12\n. Colors refer to the three steps of the analytical strategy: dark blue—first, green—second, and light blue—third step. A complete description of factors and interlinkages can be found in the original paper.\nFull size image\nWe investigated these relationships in a case study conducted in a megacity of the Global South, São Paulo, Brazil. First, we explore how people’s perceptions of the setting (i.e., environment-related factors) contribute to their restorative experience and how they are associated with objective indicators of the setting’s quality and wildlife support (Fig.\n1\n). Users’ personal characteristics (i.e., person-related factors) are also considered to have an impact on the individual restorative experience. Second, we analyze how the same objective indicators of the setting’s quality affect wildlife support metrics. Finally, we identify and discuss potential synergies and trade-offs comparing the results for each dimension.\nResults\nA total of 994 questionnaires were collected in 20 sites. The sex proportion in our sample was different than the general population of São Paulo (52.6% female\n27\n), X\n2\n(1, N = 994) = 6.73, p ≤ 0.01), with females less represented than males (Table\n1\n). The higher proportion of respondents belonged to the range between 25 and 34 years old and reported having household income lower than two minimum wages.\nTable 1 Sociodemographic aspects of the sample. MW refers to minimum wage, which was equivalent to 998,00 Brazilian reais in 2019.\nFull size table\nThe Perceived Restorativeness Scale had a mean score of 4.02 (SD = 1.13) and was sensitive to park conditions, showing statistically significant differences in PRS score among sites (Fig.\n2\n). The predicted PRS score values of Rio Verde park and Largo da Batata square (the negative control site) are lower than all others (p < 0.04) except Guaratiba park (p = 0.112 and p = 0.169, respectively). Alfredo Volpi park shows the highest value in comparison to all parks (p < 0.02), not differing (p = 0.360) only in relation to Ibirapuera park (the positive control site).\nFigure 2\nAdjusted predictions of perceived restorativeness scores (PRS) for each park and 95% confidence intervals. The dotted line represents the mean perceived restorativeness score of the total sample. The pictures provide an idea of the different parks’ configuration and represent Alfredo Volpi (upper right), Jardim da Luz (middle), and Rio Verde (bottom).\nFull size image\nAlthough the overall means of perceived naturalness, soundscape, and management scores were similar (3.09, SD = 1.34; 3.31, SD = 1.37; 3.31, SD = 1.66, respectively), they significantly varied among sites too (Supplementary Figs.\n1\n–\n3\n). Alfredo Volpi park achieved higher mean perception scores in soundscape and naturalness dimensions (Supplementary Figs.\n1\nand\n3\n), while Povo park had the highest mean score in management perception (Supplementary Fig.\n2\n). On the other hand, Largo da Batata square had the lowest mean score in soundscape and naturalness perceptions, and Rio Verde park scored lowest in management perception. Overall mean safety perception was 3.48 (SD = 1.8), with the lowest value found in Rio Verde and the highest value in Alfredo Volpi.\nPersonal factors and perceptions affecting restorativeness\nThe first structural equation model (full model) showed moderate fit indices (model 1, Supplementary Table\n1\n) and was followed by optimized models excluding the control variable age (model 2), which had an irrelevant effect on perceived restorativeness, and the exclusion of the additional non-significant pathways of health and stress perceptions (model 3, Supplementary Table\n1\n).\nSafety perception was the variable with the largest standardized regression weight in the model, meaning that feeling unsafe in the setting had the strongest effect on perceived restorativeness, affecting it negatively (Fig.\n3\n, Supplementary Table\n2\n). Feeling unsafe was positively correlated with being female and lower household income (less than 4 minimum wages). Higher household income and being female affected positively the perceived restorativeness, however, with weaker effect sizes than setting perceptions variables.\nFigure 3\nPath diagram of the perceptions and control variables affecting perceived restorativeness (full model, model 1 in Supplementary Table\n1\n) with standardized coefficients. Dotted lines depicture pathways that were statistically non-significant (p > 0.05). Regression estimates within the measurement models were omitted in this picture for simplification.\nFull size image\nRespondents’ evaluation of the park as close to original nature and biodiverse (naturalness perception) was the most relevant setting perception, followed by management perception, and soundscape perception (Fig.\n3\n, Supplementary Table\n2\n). Naturalness perception was also correlated with management and soundscape perceptions. Self-reported health condition, stress level, and age were not relevant in the model due to small effect sizes and non-significant p-values.\nPark qualities effect on setting perceptions\nAs a preliminary analysis, we explored whether people correctly perceived the actual number of bird and tree species. The correlation between the actual number of bird and tree species and respondents’ estimation was low (r = 0.214, p = 0.000; r = 0.40, p = 0.000, respectively). Taking birds species richness estimation as an example, when respondents (N = 888) were asked about the range of bird species present in the park, 85.7% (N = 761) perceived fewer species, and only 8.1% (N = 72) perceived the correct range of species. More than half of respondents (55.5%, N = 493) estimated the presence of up to 15 species and 77.5% of up to 30 species, whereas 15 study sites reportedly have bird richness higher than 30 species with reported numbers for all study sites between 17 and 223 species per park. These results made us further investigate whether the respondents’ estimation of bird and tree richness instead of the actual number of species would produce different outcomes in the setting perceptions models. For that, we compared and reported both models below.\nIn the naturalness perception model with objective predictors, only the proportion of tree canopy (p = 0.000) and the presence of understorey vegetation (p = 0.040) were significant predictors, showing positive and similar effect sizes (Fig.\n4\n). The concurrent model (model 2, Fig.\n4\n), which replaced the actual number of bird and tree species with the estimated mean number by the respondent, yielded a lower AIC value (2567.097 versus 2592.133). In this improved model, the proportion of canopy (p = 0.000) and understorey presence (p = 0.003) remained as significant factors with higher effect sizes on naturalness perception however, birds (p = 0.000) and trees (p = 0.000) species estimations, as well as water score (p = 0.028), were also statistically significant predictors but with lower effect sizes.\nFigure 4\nStandardized coefficients and 95% confidence interval of each variable included in the final models of setting perceptions (naturalness, management, and soundscape) and safety perception. The plots represent the models with objectives variables only (models 1, left side), and the models replacing biodiversity perception in the setting perceptions and including control variables in safety perception (models 2, right side). Variables with confidence intervals (bars) that do not cross 0 are statistically significant. See Table\n2\nfor definition of variables.\nFull size image\nBased on the best model (model 2), we further explored the effect of different levels of canopy coverage on naturalness perception. Keeping all covariates constant, our model indicates that the mean predicted value of naturalness starts to increase further than the overall mean (3.09) from 60% of canopy coverage (3.19, 95% CI 3.10–3.27), achieving the higher predicted mean at near 100% coverage (3.53, CI 3.39–3.67). In terms of water elements, sites without or with non-accessible water bodies show a predicted mean value lower than the naturalness perception overall mean (3.05, CI 2.84–3.25), whereas the presence of accessible artificial water bodies (3.27, CI 3.18–3.35) and, especially, access to natural water bodies (3.49, CI 3.26–3.71) increased the predicted values.\nRespondents’ management perception was negatively affected by the presence of signs of vandalism (p = 0.002), followed by positive associations with the presence of understorey vegetation (p = 0.003) and tree species richness (p = 0.001) (model 1, Fig.\n4\n). The proportion of native trees showed a lower and negative effect size (p = 0.037). In the alternative model (model 2), only vandalism (p = 0.004) and the estimation of tree richness (p = 0.000) were significant predictors, the first with the strongest effect size. The second model yielded a lower AIC value (3151.417) than model 1 (3178.294).\nThe objective model for soundscape perception resulted in four significant predictors. Water score (p = 0.000) and bird species number (p = 0.000) had the strongest effect on the perception of soundscape however, the latter showed a negative relationship. The proportion of canopy (p = 0.000) and proportion of green within 1 km radius (0.004) followed with significant but lower positive effect sizes. Alternatively, in the second model, in which we replaced the actual number of bird species with the respondents’ estimation, the direction of the relationship reversed to a positive effect, and only the estimation of bird species’ number is a significant predictor of soundscape (p = 0.039). The water score was only marginally significant (p = 0.052). The second model performed better according to AIC values (2807.002 versus 2833.303).\nRegarding safety perception, in model 1 the presence of signs of vandalism had a strong negative effect on people's perception of safety (p = 0.000), followed by a smaller positive effect of proportion of green within a 1 km radius (p = 0.004). We proceeded by adding to the model the control variables sex and income (significantly associated with safety in the SEM model), and the objective indicator of criminality. In this second model, which performed better (AIC 3029.772 versus 3188.77), vandalism kept the strongest effect on safety perception (p = 0.000), followed by the participant’s sex, with being female having a smaller and negative effect (p = 0.000). Proportion of green within 1 km radius lost relevancy, as well as income.\nPark qualities effect on wildlife support\nThe lowest number of observed bird species in the reference samples from the eBird dataset was found at Independência park, with 7 species, and the highest number was observed in Nove de Julho park, with 64 species. The mean urbanity index was 0.85 (in a range of 0.58–1.0). Effort time (minutes of observation) did not have an effect on the outcome variables, and the models that included it as a covariate resulted in higher AIC values. Therefore, only the best models (without this covariate) are reported.\nHigher estimates of bird species richness are associated with a lower proportion of tree canopy (p = 0.000) and higher water score (p = 0.036) (Fig.\n5\n). Shannon diversity is negatively affected by proportion of canopy (p = 0.003) and the presence of understorey vegetation (p = 0.043). A high urbanity index is associated with a high proportion of vegetation within 1 km (p = 0.018). The interaction effect between proportion of tree canopy and presence of understorey was significant only in the urbanity index model, showing a negative relationship with urbanity (p = 0.002). Sites with 80–100% of tree canopy and with understorey vegetation are predicted to show a significantly lower urbanity index than sites with the same canopy proportion but without understorey (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001 respectively, Fig.\n6\n).\nFigure 5\nStandardized coefficients and 95% confidence interval of each variable included in the final models of bird community support (species richness, diversity, and urbanity).

This figure highlights the factors that were significant in both objective and subjective models of setting perceptions, and allow the identification of synergies and trade-offs between the human and animal dimensions.\nDiscussion\nPark quality and user restoration\nOur findings reveal that urban parks can show significant variation in their restorative potential, and may in some cases not even differ to a busy city square. The quality of these spaces plays a decisive role in the provision of psychological restoration opportunities linked to improved well-being.\nSafety perception was the strongest factor affecting the perceived restorativeness of park users. Feeling safe in the environment is a basic condition to permit the rest of directed attention\n28\nand this finding reflects that vulnerability to criminal acts in such open spaces may hinder green space benefits. Naturalness perception—the similarity with a natural and biodiverse environment—had the second strongest effect on perceived restorativeness. Nature fulfills two main components of the restorative experience: “fascination” towards living beings and processes, and “being away” to a setting with a different content than everyday life\n28\n. Provided safety conditions, high naturalness perception is the main factor to be aimed for in park design for improved restorative potential.\nVegetation coverage within and adjacent to park boundaries indirectly affected users’ perceived restorativeness through their perceptions of naturalness and soundscape. The beneficial effect of higher levels of tree canopy cover can be associated with the effectiveness of tree belts and street trees as barriers to environmental noise, and even beyond, vegetation may also induce a greater perception of noise reduction than the actual values\n29\n,\n30\n. A park with high tree canopy coverage may evoke familiarity with the original environmental condition as São Paulo is embedded in the Atlantic Forest biome, in which mature forests are made-up of big trees, an abundance of epiphytes, and multiple vegetation layers\n31\n. This forest density is also a potential explanation for the positive effect of understorey vegetation on naturalness and management perception, suggesting that it did not create a perception of overgrowth and unmanaged vegetation but rather an intentional decision to foster the natural aspect of the vegetation patch. Contrary to our expectations based on previous studies\n32\n,\n33\n, perceived safety was not associated with park configuration or vegetation aspects. This means that management actions such as the removal of understorey vegetation for improved visual permeability\n32\n, in this case, actually weaken restorative outcomes and do not necessarily improve the user’s sense of safety in the park.\nAdditionally, aspects of vegetation composition affected the way people perceived park management. Higher perceptions of management were associated with a higher number of tree species (objective and perceived) but in a lower proportion of native in comparison to exotic species. This finding can be associated with previous studies showing that park users are more attentive to ornamental and emblematic species, which are usually exotic species intentionally cultivated by gardeners\n34\n. This effect is more likely associated with their attractiveness than with the identification of their “nativeness” by the general public, as non-native species may be seen as unusual, more colorful, and interesting\n35\n. Therefore, park users correctly associated the increasing presence of ornamental/exotic trees with higher levels of intervention and vegetation care.\nThe presence of water features is known to positively affect nature\n36\nand soundscape perceptions\n37\n, and the degree to which water benefits restoration depends not only on its presence but also its accessibility\n38\n. In our study, a combination of accessibility (possibility of visual, acoustic, and/or physical contact) and the natural condition of the water body yielded the best outcomes for restoration through greater naturalness and soundscape perceptions. This aspect is highly relevant in a context where water bodies are often present in parks but, due to their poor ecological condition, are isolated or hidden from users through physical barriers or a design that does not encourage contact with this feature. In this sense, efforts in the ecological restoration of water bodies within parks are highly recommended.\nAn aspect of site management is of high relevancy for parks’ restoration potential. Visible signs of vandalism in park facilities have the greatest effect on management and safety perceptions. The effect on management perception is related to the evidence of the inability of the administration to repair or replace damaged facilities. The presence of clear signs of vandalism in the park such as graffiti and broken facilities are the main predictors of safety perception whereas a quantitative indicator of criminality in the region is not relevant, which can be explained by the “Broken Windows Theory”\n39\n. The theory states that when signs of disorder are left unrepaired the feeling of carelessness raises fearfulness in residents, which may not be associated with an actual increase in crime rates. Our findings also suggest that park quality may reflect neighborhood socioeconomic level, as respondents’ income is not associated with perceived safety when accounting for park characteristics. In this regard, focusing financial resources on parks’ maintenance would be an effective measure to improve safety perception and consequently boost their restorative potential.\nAn additional important factor for safety perception is sex disparity. Even when accounting for park quality and other control factors, sex remained a relevant factor with being female positively associated with unsafety perception, similar to findings in urban green spaces of other Global South countries\n32\n. The lower share of female respondents in our sample compared to the general population of São Paulo suggests that females might be underrepresented in these spaces in a reflection of safety issues. Considering that females are at higher risk of developing mental health issues than males, and may benefit more from urban green spaces\n40\n, it is essential that public policies promoting the use of open (green) spaces also focus on female's safety, ensuring that they have equal opportunity to enjoy the whole potential of urban parks for their health benefits.\nPark quality and wildlife support\nRegarding the wildlife dimension, not only the presence but also the naturalness of parks’ water bodies matters for bird species support in terms of overall richness. Microclimate effects such as milder temperatures close to water elements, as well as the habitat and food resources provided by natural water bodies, were proposed as possible reasons for the positive relationship between water and bird richness already reported in São Paulo city\n41\n. On the other hand, the negative effect of higher levels of closed canopy on bird species richness and diversity contradicts previous studies in urban areas\n42\nbut is in line with other findings\n43\n. The positive effects of water presence and lower proportion of tree canopy suggest that bird richness in these urban parks is driven by habitat heterogeneity. Green spaces that provide multiple microhabitats such as forest patches, open vegetation, and water bodies, offer a broader range of resources and can attract bird species with varying habitat and foraging requirements\n43\n. The association between understorey vegetation and bird diversity may be explained by an unbalanced presence of forest-dependent species in parks with forest remnants and larger forest patches. Notably, these results were influenced by the high diversity estimates in parks located at wetlands on the border of Guarapiranga water reservoir, which present the lowest canopy proportions in our sample (around 20%) but are habitats of good ecological quality. This also indicates that tree canopy cover alone may not be used as a proxy of ecological quality for the bird assemblage, at least in the environmental configuration of São Paulo city’s parks.\nWhen looking at a qualitative aspect of the bird assemblages in each park, the interaction between vegetation aspects was relevant and resulted in distinct outcomes. While higher canopy proportion and the presence of understorey negatively affected diversity estimates, the combination of these aspects reduced urbanity levels of the bird assemblage. This means that bird species more sensitive to human disturbances—and of higher conservation value—are benefitting from higher park tree canopy proportion when accompanied by understorey vegetation. The presence of understorey vegetation improves the ecological quality of urban forest patches in terms of providing nesting sites, increased forage availability, protection against predators and domestic animals, and is especially important to small-body and ground/understorey-nesting species, which are more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance\n44\n,\n45\n.\nIt is important to emphasize that this analysis did not aim to investigate all relevant features driving bird diversity estimates in urban parks, therefore our results must be interpreted in the context of comparison with the human dimension. Several green space features that are known to affect urban wildlife were not considered due to their irrelevancy for psychological restoration outcomes. Additionally, the analysis could not take into account green spaces with very low ecological quality due to either the lack of bird checklists or insufficient sampling effort in such areas. Bird watchers are usually attracted to more natural-like areas where the potential for bird encounters is higher. The inclusion of bird surveys in parks of lower ecological quality would contribute to the clarification of the tree canopy effect, especially in sites with lower than 40% of tree coverage.\nParks for humans and wildlife\nPark users’ impression of being in a place similar to a natural habitat with several animal and plant species (naturalness perception) was the main setting perception contributing to restorativeness, being more relevant than the perception of maintenance and facilities. This finding suggests that the design and management of parks that maximize the restorative potential should focus on promoting nature rather than overly manicured green spaces. This is a synergy with what is also necessary to effectively provide habitats for different wildlife species and to promote the environmental quality of the green space itself.\nWe identified synergies and trade-offs between significant green space indicators for users’ mental restoration and bird assemblage support. A clear synergy is the presence of water bodies, especially with a natural aspect, which improved bird richness as well as restoration through higher perceptions of naturalness and soundscape. Therefore, this is a feature that should receive high relevance in the design and management of green spaces.\nOn the other hand, proportion of canopy cover presented both synergies and trade-offs depending on quantitative or qualitative aspects of bird species support. While higher tree canopy proportions with understorey vegetation provide higher restorative potential to users and benefit bird species of higher conservation value, it also reduces bird diversity estimates. However, birds were the only animal group considered in this study, and it is likely that other groups (from larger mammals to arthropods) do respond differently to canopy proportions and understorey vegetation features. Although the positive effect of lower tree canopy on diversity estimates may be a trade-off with psychological restoration, it could be considered a synergy with other human benefits, as a park with different habitats may provide more opportunities for recreational activities.\nAlthough the proportion of native tree species was not significant in the wildlife models (only marginally significant for the urbanity index), the negative relationship of higher proportion of native tree species and management perception of users can be discussed in the light of existing evidence. Studies conducted in Brazil\n46\nand abroad\n47\nhave shown that exotic tree species can provide important resources across seasons for birds in urban areas. Although the presence of exotic tree species in urban parks might be seen as a synergy between restoration and support to birds, the mega biodiversity of Brazil must stimulate the exploration of native plant species\n46\nthat are less known or still not used in urban areas. Choosing native plant species which can provide the attractiveness and resources that the exotics are currently offering to humans and animals and which are naturally adapted to local conditions would boost biodiversity conservation and resilience in cities.\nOur results contribute to the emerging evidence of the beneficial effect of biodiversity on human health and well-being\n19\n,\n20\n,\n48\n, through the psychological restoration pathway. Regardless of the actual number of bird and tree species, people´s estimation of biodiversity was of high relevance to the three domains of setting perceptions related to restoration potential. Higher estimation of bird species by users was associated with better soundscape perception as the single predictor in the best model, in opposition to actual bird richness. The mismatch between people's perception of biodiversity and objective indicators was reported before\n34\nand the general underestimation of bird richness in our case may be due to either short visit duration that does not allow the encounter with many species, the lack of knowledge on local biodiversity, and due to the cumulative aspect of the bird inventories (See Methods section). In this sense, investment in environmental education of the population on local biodiversity could lead to enhanced benefits to mental well-being. As urban parks are the logical places for connecting with nature in urban areas, simple interventions such as guided tours and biodiversity-focused signage can improve visit quality and hence boost the restorative experience. Furthermore, future studies could explore and validate some of the associations identified here using qualitative data such as interviews with park visitors, as well as improve the wildlife data carrying out bird surveys especially on the same days as questionnaire application.\nConclusions\nThis is the first study to provide quantitative evidence on the restorative potential of urban parks in Brazil, contributing to the understanding of pathways linking the environment to human health benefits. The findings highlight that urban parks can play an important role in mitigating the urban psychological penalty, or the negative effects of city on mental health and well-being, offering opportunities to recover from depleted psychological capacities and stress. To maximize this potential, safety perception should be prioritized as a fundamental condition for restoration in São Paulo’s urban parks, while design and management should focus on features that enhance the naturalness perception of users, the second key factor contributing to perceived restorativeness of users.\nWe show that park quality is crucial in determining its restorative potential for visitors. Settings of high restorative potential should have a forest-like appearance with abundant tree canopy (> 60%) and multiple vegetation layers, and feature numerous tree species (including exotic ones). Additionally, the presence of easily accessible natural water bodies can enhance the restorative experience further. In terms of management, financial resources should be prioritized for the repair of signs of disorder such as graffiti and broken facilities, avoiding the depreciation of park benefits due to safety concerns.\nInterdisciplinary socio-ecological studies are important to shed light on potential synergies and trade-offs between different beneficiaries of green spaces. Through a holistic approach, we were able to provide recommendations for the design and management of urban parks considering benefits to both human well-being and urban wildlife conservation. Taken altogether, our results suggest that incorporating natural water bodies into park design maximizes benefits for both dimensions. “Forest-like” parks provide higher restorative potential to users while benefiting bird species of higher conservation value. On the other hand, more heterogeneous parks may provide better bird diversity estimates, and, despite lower restorative outcomes, they could provide more diverse recreational opportunities to users.\nBesides the intrinsic value of nature, the evidence that higher biodiversity level is also a relevant factor influencing human well-being reinforces the importance of investing in urban nature. We underscore that attention to green space quality is essential to effectively provide the expected benefits for human health and biodiversity conservation. Our findings support efforts towards healthier and biodiverse cities through the provision of a heterogeneous green infrastructure consisting of a network of spaces that are purposely designed and managed to reconcile both human and wildlife needs.\nMethods\nStudy area\nThe city of São Paulo, located in southeastern Brazil (Fig.\n7\na), is the fourth largest urban agglomeration (22 million inhabitants)\n49\n, and has one of the highest prevalence of mental disorders in the world (29.6%), with 10% of severe cases\n50\n. This megacity overlaps the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot\n51\nand 48% of its territory is covered by vegetation (of different types). Despite the high share of vegetation, it is unequally distributed across regions (Fig.\n7\nb), with coverage ranging from 16% in the center to 62% in the southern region\n52\n.\nFigure 7\nMaps showing the (\na\n) Location of the city of São Paulo (yellow triangle) within the state of São Paulo (dark gray) and Brazil. (\nb\n) Land use map of São Paulo municipality showing the distribution of vegetation and green areas in relation to the build area, with study areas and their 1 km buffers in detail (\nc\n). Land use data downloaded from GeoSampa platform (\nhttps://geosampa.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/\n).\nFull size image\nThe existing 111 municipal parks are categorized as urban, linear, reserve, and natural. Reserves and natural parks are intended for biodiversity conservation, and because their accessibility for the public is restricted, these categories were not considered in this study. According to the municipality, urban parks are structured fenced spaces that protect biodiversity and provide recreational and sports facilities, whereas linear parks are riverside areas usually not fenced. The latter may or may not present recreational facilities as their main objectives are the protection of areas adjacent to water bodies and the connectivity between green areas. Looking at the characteristics of these spaces, there is a broad range of variation in aspects of the spatial configuration, vegetation structure, design, and management, making them a useful case to test the effect of park quality on our response variables.\nResearch design\nAn observational study with cross-sectional data collection was conducted capturing ecological and social perspectives in the context of urban green spaces. Primary data was collected through a questionnaire elaborated to assess park users’ perceptions and socio-demographic aspects. Secondary data was retrieved to compute green space indicators and biodiversity variables.\nOur analytical approach comprised three main steps (Fig.\n1\n). First, we investigated the effect of users’ perceptions of the setting on restorativeness by conducting a structural equation model, as this analysis considers the particularities and errors attached to self-reported data and the use of psychometric and rating scales. In the second step, we used mixed models to assess associations between objective indicators of green space quality and users’ perceptions of the setting. Finally, through linear regressions, we assessed the effect of green space indicators on wildlife support variables.\nWildlife data\nUrban wildlife support in this study is represented by the bird assemblages observed in each park. Birds have been used as biodiversity indicators for several reasons, such as relatively easy identification and data availability, and are conservation flagships due to the interest and concern by the public\n53\n. We used two different sets of secondary data to obtain metrics for human perceptions and wildlife models.\nThe number of bird species observed in each park was used as an independent variable in the human perceptions models. Data were extracted from the Wildlife Inventory of São Paulo city\n54\n, which present a cumulative species list for each park, including observations since 1993. Surveys comprise transect counts, recording of birdsongs, and mist-net sampling. More recently, these lists also include observations collected in a structured citizen science program conducted by the municipality to promote bird watching in parks (i.e., “Vem Passarinhar”).\nFor the bird support models, we opted to use data from the citizen science platform eBird (\nhttps://ebird.org\n), which provides checklists including the abundance of each observed bird species, thus allowing the estimation of standardized bird species diversity estimates. eBird is a data source of bird observations from a global network of volunteers, which follow collection protocols and data quality checks through automated filters and experts review\n55\n. Checklists from São Paulo state were obtained within the timeframe of January 2009 to July 2022.\nSelection of parks for survey\nTo enhance the representativeness of our set of study sites considering the variation found in city parks’ characteristics, we adopted a stratified sampling approach to select sites from the total of 92 urban parks under the ownership of the municipal government that were legally created and qualified until 2019, and accessible to the general public. As 90% of these parks are below 20 ha in size, we set a cut point value of 10 ha to categorize them into smaller or larger parks. Six groups were created based on park area and visual estimation of tree canopy cover (low, medium, or high). Three parks from each group were selected representing, as much as possible, different levels of socioeconomic vulnerability (low, medium, or high) classified within a 1 km radius of park boundaries (Fig.\n7\nc). Besides the selected 18 parks, the most popular city park (Ibirapuera) and a busy central square (Largo da Batata) were included representing best and worst cases (see Fig.\n2\nfor a list of study sites). For this preparatory assessment, we obtained geo-referenced data on park boundaries and the Paulista Index of Social Vulnerability at the census tract level from the GeoSampa platform kept by the Municipality of São Paulo (geosampa.prefeitura.sp.gov.br) and combined them with Google Satellite images on QGIS 3.10.5.\nQuestionnaire with park users\nAn on-site questionnaire survey with visitors of each study site was conducted from March to June 2019, during the dry season. Each site was visited twice, on a workday and a weekend day, from 8 am to dusk, and under similar weather conditions. Respondents were randomly approached among people that were visiting the park. Eligible participants were Brazilian adult (≥ 18 years old) residents of the city. Participation was anonymous and subjected to the signature of an informed consent form by all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s). The questionnaire was designed in a sequence aimed to reduce response bias and was applied by trained interviewers. Cards with response options for the questions were offered to avoid answer errors. The average time to complete the questionnaire was 15 min. This study was approved by the Brazilian National Committee on Research Ethics (CONEP, CAAE: 00239018.7.0000.5390), and all procedures complied with ethical guidelines on research with humans.\nThe questionnaire was divided into four sections: self-reported health and stress level, perceived restorativeness, setting and biodiversity perceptions, and sociodemographic factors. The first section comprised the individual health perception made up of three items (general health, mental health, and well-being) evaluated on a 5-point scale. In addition, stress perception in the last month was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale\n56\n, which is composed of 10 items evaluated on a 5-point scale validated to Brazilian Portuguese\n57\n. The second section included a version of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale\n58\ncomposed of 15 items evaluated on a 7-point scale, from 0 to 6, comprising the being away, fascination, and compatibility dimensions, and validated for the target population\n59\n. The third section comprised a scale to assess perceptions of the setting in three dimensions (3 items each, 7-point scale) built upon previous studies\n60\n,\n61\n: soundscape perception on pleasantness, eventfulness, quietness (e.g. “This park has a pleasant soundscape”); management perception regarding maintenance of facilities and vegetation, and overall cleanliness (e.g. “This park’s vegetation is well cared for”); naturalness perception in terms of similarity to nature and biodiversity (e.g. “This park looks like an untouched nature”). Additionally, single questions were used to measure the perception of safety (i.e. “This setting transmits a sense of safety”, 7-point scale), and biodiversity estimation (i.e. “About how many species of birds and trees would you say exist in this park?”). The response to the latter question consisted of five intervals of species estimation for trees (up to 50, 51–100, 101–150, 151–200, more than 200) and birds (up to 15, 16–30, 31–60, 61–100, more than 100) according to the range found in the parks’ inventories. The fourth section included socio-demographic self-reported questions such as sex, age, and income.\nPark quality indicators\nData on 38 indicators reflecting park quality were collected for the sampled sites, comprising aspects of spatial configuration (e.g. proportion of tree canopy coverage), vegetation structure (e.g. proportion of native tree species), design (e.g. number of habitats), management (e.g. cleanliness), and adjacent landscape (e.g. vegetated area within 1 km radius). Indicators were selected from a previous study that explored green space characteristics affecting wildlife support and mental health\n12\nand in participatory consultation with practitioners from the São Paulo municipality through a workshop conducted in 2019. This consultation aimed at tailoring the analysis towards results that could be easily translated into practical recommendations on the planning and management of green spaces. A first filter was applied using a Pearson correlation matrix to identify and exclude indicators that were highly correlated (r > 0.80) with two or more indicators, leaving a total of 19 to be considered in the following analyzes (Supplementary Table\n3\n).\nData on vegetation coverage was obtained from the Digital Mapping of São Paulo Vegetation Cover\n52\n. Vegetation patches were identified and classified into 15 categories on a 1:1.000 scale, based on orthophotos of the year 2017/2018 with 0.12 m of resolution and 3D digital mapping (LiDAR). Plant diversity metrics were calculated based on the Flora Inventories of Municipal Parks\n62\n. Indicators of park management and design (Table\n2\n) were collected mainly on-site on the same days of the questionnaires’ application.\nTable 2 List of green space indicators used in the final models of setting perceptions. For continuous variables, the mean number or percentage across parks and range is provided. For categorical variables (defined as 0 or 1), the frequency refers to the percentage of parks in the mentioned category.\nFull size table\nData analysis—factors affecting restorativeness\nWe tested construct validity of the psychometric scales through reliability and factorial validity analysis. We adopted recommended thresholds indicating adequate parameter values and good model fit as Cronbach’s alpha (α) higher than 0.70\n63\n, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) higher than 0.95, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) lower than 0.06, and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) equal to or below 0.08\n64\n. These analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 24 and R software version 4.0.0 using the ‘lavaan’ package (version 0.6-12).\nFor the Perceived Stress Scale and Perceived Restorativeness Scale we conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) since their structures were analyzed before\n57\n,\n59\n. Both scales confirmed their one-factor and second-order structures with adequate internal consistency and fit indices (α = 0.81 and 0.92, respectively, Supplementary Table\n4\n). The factorial structure of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale enables the calculation of a perceived restorativeness score (PRS score) based on the average of items from the being away, fascination, and compatibility dimensions. We then tested the sensibility of the PRS score to differences across sampled sites estimating margins of responses and 95% confidence intervals for each site and performing pairwise comparisons of the predicted margins. For this analysis, we used the software STATA 16.1.\nThe three items referring to self-reported health status were combined into a latent variable “Perceived health”, which presented adequate internal consistency (α = 0.76). For the settings perception scale, we conducted a Principal Components Analysis with three fixed factors, which confirmed that the items loaded in the proposed dimensions (soundscape, management, and naturalness), each of them with adequate internal consistency (α = 0.73, 0.88, 0.70, respectively, Supplementary Table\n4\n). We then calculated an average score from the three items of each perception to be used as dependent variables in the regression models.\nAfter confirming the robustness of our scales, we investigated how visitors' perceptions of safety and the setting, and personal factors affected restorativeness according to our theoretical framework (Fig.\n1\n). Considering the nature of this subjective data, we conducted a structural equation model (SEM) with the latent variable perceived restorativeness (made up of its three dimensions) as the response variable, and the latent variables of settings perceptions (soundscape, management, and naturalness), as well as safety perception as predictors. In this analysis, we did not consider the park effect, but rather relationships at the individual level, and therefore we included the effect of control variables sex, age, income, and self-reported health (latent variables of health perception and stress perception). Income and safety perception were transformed into the dummy variables “up to (0)/more than four minimum wages (1)” and “safe (0)/unsafe (1)” (unsafe merged scores from 0 to 2).\nThe SEM analysis was conducted with the Weighted Least Squares Means and Variances (WLSMV) estimation method, which is more appropriate and with superior performance than Maximum Likelihood for the ordinal level of scale items and large sample sizes\n65\n. The model was subsequently optimized with the exclusion of non-relevant pathways. Indicators of good model fit followed the same thresholds mentioned for the psychometric tests. Analyzes were performed in R software using the ’lavaan’ package (version 0.6-12).\nData analysis—park quality and user perceptions\nTo understand how park characteristics affected respondents’ perceptions of the setting, we first tested the necessity of multilevel analysis to account for the non-independency of observations (respondents clustered in parks) running null models (without predictors) including a random-effect (park) and checking a significant effect on intercepts and intraclass correlation\n66\n. As all models were significantly different from one-level linear models and intraclass correlation ranged from 0.158 to 0.367, we conducted mixed-effects linear models for each perception score (naturalness, soundscape, and management) as dependent variables, park indicators as fixed factors, and park name as random factor. Potential green space indicators for each perception were selected based on theory and evidence accumulated in the field (Supplementary Table\n3\n). The number of bird species observed in each park was included as fixed effect in the models of naturalness and soundscape perception. Observations collected in the site ’Largo da Batata’ (N = 50) were excluded in all models, and observations in ’Benemérito José Bras’ (N = 56) were excluded in models of soundscape and naturalness, both due to incomplete biodiversity data.\nAs preliminary analyzes showed a poor correlation between the actual number of bird and tree species with respondents’ estimation of richness (see “Results” section), we contrasted models using only objective indicators (model 1) with models replacing objective indicators of species richness by respondent’s estimation of richness (model 2). For the species richness estimation variables, we used the mean number of species of the interval selected by the respondent in the questionnaire.\nAdditionally, we explored green space predictors of safety perception using a mixed-effects ordered logistic regression, considering that the response variable is a Likert-scale item\n67\n. We compared a model including only park predictors (model 1) with a model including control factors that could influence safety perception in the setting (model 2). These comprised significant personal factors resulting from the SEM analysis and an indicator of criminality level in the region (number of thefts registered in the closest police station to each park during the year 2018, source: Sou da Paz Analisa, soudapaz.org).\nFor all models, we checked multicollinearity between predictors and adopted a full model approach, constructing models that included all variables with acceptable variance inflation factor\n68\n(VIF < 10) (Table\n2\n). Models were run with robust estimation of standard errors of regression coefficients, which account for data heteroscedasticity and other violations of distributional assumptions\n67\n. Model diagnostics included the exclusion of influential values based on Cook’s distance and residual plots to check the normality and homoscedasticity of residuals. We compared model performance through the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), with lower values indicating a better fit. We further explored statistically significant variables of the models calculating predictive margins for different levels of the response variables keeping all covariates constant. All analyzes were conducted in STATA 16.1. Visualization of models’ results in the form of coefficient plots (with standardization of continuous and ordinal variables using z-scores) was elaborated with the ‘dotwhisker’ package (version 0.7.4) in R.\nData analysis—park quality and wildlife support\nWe constructed models of bird species support based on three different response variables calculated from the eBird dataset. We followed recommended steps for data clearing and filtering\n69\nusing only complete checklists, stationary or traveling protocols, and merging duplicate lists according to sampling event identifier. A dataset with checklists for each park was created intersecting geographic coordinates from the checklists with the shapefiles of park boundaries. A reference sample for each park was selected based on the following criteria: observation period ranging from 60 to 100 min, number of observed specimens available for all species reported (removal of lists in which bird species were reported as “X”—no count), and finally, the higher number of species reported. The definition of the range of observation period aimed to reduce variability in sampling effort while allowing enough time for observation of a high number of species\n70\n. After applying the criteria, the timeframe of the selected checklists was reduced to the period of 2016 to 2022. We used a sample of 30 parks according to data availability on park characteristics and compliance with sampling effort criteria. A matrix with individual counts for each species by park was used as input to estimate species richness and Shannon diversity index on the ‘iNEXT’ package (version 3.0.0) in R. Using the ‘estimateD’ function, these diversity estimates were computed by standardizing samples by coverage\n71\n, at the minimum sample coverage level among all sites. Additionally, we calculated the urbanity index of each park’s checklist. This index (adapted from the urbanophobe index\n42\n) considers the degree of vulnerability of species to anthropic disturbance, commonly found in urban environments. The level of sensibility of each bird species (low, medium, high) was assessed in available literature\n72\nand the index is calculated as the share of species with low sensibility out of the total number of bird species. A high index reflects a bird assemblage composed of a majority of species more tolerable to human disturbances instead of species that require a higher level of habitat quality.\nFirstly, we tested if our response variables were spatially correlated through the Moran’s I test using the package ‘ape’ (version 5.6-2) in R. As spatial auto-correlation was not significant for all outcomes variables, we proceeded to run three linear regression models including all predictors that were statistically significant in the analysis of setting perceptions. This is in concordance with the aim of the study of analyzing potential synergies and trade-offs between human and animal dimensions using the same indicators. As park area was not correlated with bird richness (r = 0.30, p = 0.103) and diversity (r = 0.28, p = 0.137), we did not include it as a control variable in the models. However, we tested concurrent models by adding the sampling effort time (duration of bird survey) as a covariate. Due to the limited sample size, we used ‘lasso’ command to select the best predictive variables to be included in the final models. We adopted model selection and diagnostic approaches already mentioned in Sect. 3.5.3. Apart from investigating the main effects of variables, we ran additional regressions testing an interaction effect between proportion of canopy and the presence of understorey on all three independent variables. All analyses were conducted in STATA 16.1 and the coefficient plot in R.\nData availability\nThe data generated for the current study are not publicly available due to further analyses being planned, but de-identified data may be made available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

        "abstract": "Access to greenspace in the form of urban parks is frequently used to study the mental health benefits of nature and may alleviate depression. However, there is a lack of research that considers the different types of vegetated and non-vegetated spaces that parks can provide. Our aim was to investigate whether different types of accessible park area, grassy; tree covered; and non-vegetated, were associated with depressive symptoms among older (≥50 years) urban US adults. We used interviews from the Health and Retirement Study spanning 2010 through 2016 as our primary data source. We calculated total grassy, tree covered, and non-vegetated park space accessible to participants using a comprehensive national database of US parks and a high resolution (10 m) landcover dataset. To measure depressive symptoms, we used the CESD-8 analyzed as a continuous scale. We used Poisson regression to estimate the percent difference in CESD-8 scores comparing quartiles of accessible park space. To control for confounding, we adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, geography, and climate. Aggregated accessible park area was not substantively associated with depressive symptoms. However, having grassy park area near the home was associated with as much as 27 % fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, non-vegetated park area was associated with up to 54 % more depressive symptoms. Our findings were robust to adjustment for air pollution, environmental noise, and artificial light at night. Different types of accessible park space may have disparate effects on mental health among older urban US adults.",

Introduction\nUrban farming, also known as urban agriculture, comprises cultivating, processing, distributing, and recycling food and other agricultural products within cities or urban environments. It involves food and sometimes non-food item production on land and other spaces within cities and surrounding areas [\n1\n], utilizing various methods and technologies to maximize productivity in limited spaces. Urban farming includes rooftop gardens, vertical and community gardens, and indoor and urban livestock farming [\n2\n]. A community garden is a piece of land (either public or private) gardened by a group of people. Gardens can be purely ornamental, grow vegetables for individual use or sale, or protect wildlife and native plants.\nUrban farming has become mainstream, and many cities have embraced and supported initiatives encouraging local food production. Governments, non-profits, and community organizations have promoted urban farming as a sustainable solution to various urban challenges [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n]. Urban farming not only produces food but also brings communities together and fosters social connections [\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n], recreation and leisure [\n11\n], and educational opportunities on topics such as sustainable agriculture, nutrition, and food security [\n9\n,\n12\n,\n13\n]. Many cities have implemented policies and regulations that support urban farming. These policies include zoning changes to allow agricultural activities to be within city limits, incentives for land use, and easing restrictions on the sale of locally grown produce. With growing urban populations and potential vulnerabilities in the global food supply chain, urban farming is viewed as a way to enhance food security by promoting local production and reducing dependency on distant sources [\n14\n]. Urban farming is a more sustainable approach to food production because it reduces the carbon footprint associated with long-distance food transportation and minimizes the need for chemical inputs using methods such as hydroponics.\nUrban farming is vital for creating sustainable, resilient, healthy cities [\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n]. It addresses food security, environmental concerns, community well-being, and economic development, making it an important urban planning and development component. The benefits of urban farming include increased access to fresh food, reduced environmental impacts, community engagement, green spaces, biodiversity [\n19\n,\n20\n], food security, and resilience.\nAn American case study reported that gardening brings health benefits and that gardeners are less likely to be obese and more likely to meet healthy dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption [\n21\n,\n22\n]. Urban farming also increases creativity and inspiration, improves the urban mental benefits of farmers, and increases cultural capital by establishing trust and close connections among family members, helping to create a cultural identity and feeling of belonging and providing a safe and encouraging place to acquire new knowledge while learning more about gardening [\n23\n]. Gardeners reported significantly higher levels of subjective well-being than non-gardeners [\n24\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]. Community gardeners have significantly better health outcomes than neighbors not engaged in gardening activities regarding life satisfaction, happiness, general health, mental health, and social cohesion [\n28\n]. An online survey of gardeners and non-gardeners aged 60–69 years in Japan demonstrated the positive effects of gardening on health and lifestyle [\n26\n]. Some studies have reported that community gardening supports and sustains healthy and active lifestyles, reducing cancer risk and other chronic diseases [\n29\n]. Urban farming is vital to promote sustainability, healthy eating habits, and community engagement.\nHowever, several challenges must be addressed to ensure urban farms’ success and contribution to sustainable food production. Some of the key problems and challenges in urban farming include limited space [\n30\n,\n31\n], soil quality and contamination [\n32\n], access to water, land tenure [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n] and regulations [\n36\n], labor and skill shortages, pest and disease management, perception and social acceptance, seasonal limitations, distribution, and marketing. Addressing these challenges can contribute to the growth and sustainability of urban farming, which is an integral part of future food systems.\nDespite these challenges, urban agriculture continues to gain attention and support because it addresses food security, reduces food miles, promotes local economies, and improves urban environments. Various government initiatives, community organizations, and non-profits are working to overcome these challenges and promote the growth of urban agriculture for a more sustainable and resilient urban future.\nUrban attitudes and perceptions play crucial roles in the development of urban farming for several reasons. Urban farming requires the availability of land and space in a city. If urban residents perceive urban agriculture negatively, they may resist allocating valuable urban land for farming. However, positive attitudes can increase the support for converting vacant lots or rooftops into urban farms. Local policies and regulations influence urban farming development. The attitudes and perceptions of urbanites can influence policymakers and lawmakers by encouraging them to create supportive policies for urban agriculture or discouraging them from doing so. Urban farming depends on the community’s participation and support. Suppose urbanites have a positive attitude toward farming in a city. In that case, they may be more willing to actively participate in urban farming initiatives, volunteer their time and resources, or even become urban farmers. The success of urban farming depends on economic viability. If urbanites view urban agriculture as a valuable contributor to the local economy, they may be inclined to support and invest in it. Conversely, negative perceptions can hinder financial support and investments.\nSeveral knowledge gaps exist in the literature pertinent to urban farming. First, the current literature focuses on the effects of gardening on mental and physical health and the challenges of sustaining an urban garden [\n10\n,\n24\n,\n25\n,\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n,\n40\n]. However, mental and social benefits have largely lagged behind physical benefits. Second, there are several studies on the motivations of urban gardeners [\n22\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n] and non-gardeners [\n47\n,\n48\n]. Most studies consider the benefits and motivations of the gardener population while ignoring the willingness to instate urban farming practices among the entire population of urbanites. Most studies surveyed urban gardeners, while other functions of urban gardening, motivation, and interest in urban farming among the total urban population were neglected. Analyzing the differences in urban farming perceptions can provide useful information for effective urban farming and planning policies. Third, the current studies are geographically unbalanced and focus on North American and European countries. In contrast, studies from other industrialized countries are still lacking. Two recent studies in Japan detailed self-reported health improvements in allotment gardeners [\n24\n,\n25\n] and retired home gardeners aged 60–69 [\n26\n].\nTo illustrate the abovementioned research in the fields of mental benefits, attitudes of the total population of urbanites toward urban farming, and case studies in Asian countries, we designed a questionnaire survey on Okinawa Island, Japan. This study aimed to clarify the motivations for urban gardening, features of urban farming, and challenges of urban farming promotions, explore the differences between urban farmers and non-farmers, and predict the effects of motivations and respondents’ characteristics on their experiences of urban farming. Specifically, we aimed to clarify the differences in motivations between those who farm and those who plan to farm and the features of urban farmers, and predict the effects of motivations and respondents’ characteristics on their experiences of urban farming.\nWe took Japan as a case study to add to the knowledge of urban farming practices in an industrial country in Asia owing to several demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental challenges that Japanese society is facing, such as a super-aging society, an aging farming population, shrinking rural regions, limited agricultural land, and a low food self-sufficiency rate. This research is the first report on the motivations of urbanites in Japan and will fill the gap in pertinent knowledge of highly urbanized and super-aging societies worldwide.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Data Collection and Survey Site\nA self-administered questionnaire was used to survey residents’ motivation and knowledge pertinent to urban farming. A pilot survey was conducted in February 2020 to select motivation indicators. For the motivation for gardening, we referred to previous literature [\n24\n,\n49\n] to include a few topics, including growing vegetables to eat, relaxing, interacting with nature, learning farming skills, and enjoying social interactions. A few questions dealing with isolation during the pandemic were added to the measurement.\nThe questionnaire comprised four parts. The first part concerned participants’ experience related to urban farming and whether they planned to conduct urban farming even if they were not currently farming. Second, the motivations for conducting urban farming included 13 questions on food security, food safety, health benefits, social well-being, environmental protection, and the effects of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Thirteen motivations were identified, which included consuming fresh vegetables, insecticide-free vegetables, interaction with green spaces, physical and mental health, and time spent with family and friends. We used a 5-point Likert rating scale for questions on motivation. The third part asked about sociodemographic features, such as gender, age, education level, occupation, and household income. The last part consisted of optional and open-ended questions requesting that respondents leave their comments or suggestions on urban farming.\nApproximately 80% of the population is concentrated in urban areas, with 101.43 million living in urban areas in Japan. Japan is also a super-aging society, with 10% of its population aged over 80 years. Agricultural and rural areas in Japan have been declining. This survey was conducted among the urban residents of Okinawa Prefecture, a remote island region in Japan. Okinawa, a typical archipelago, consists of 160 islands of various sizes scattered across a vast ocean (\nFigure 1\n). The remoteness and small size of the islands have resulted in numerous social and economic challenges, population aging, low productivity in agricultural farming, low income levels, and high poverty levels. Traditionally, vegetable gardens are compound (\nFigure 2\n) and produce radishes, carrots, or sweet potatoes for self-consumption [\n50\n]. Community gardens (\nFigure 3\n) were introduced to Japanese society in 1992 and have been promoted since 1999 [\n51\n].\nThe data were collected online and in person. Data were collected in March 2020, April 2020, November 2021, 2022, 2023, and March 2023. Data collection was first conducted in person in March 2020. It was then interrupted by the pandemic and changed to an online survey in April, followed by online surveys among students at the University of Ryukyus in Okinawa in November 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. After the pandemic, the survey resumed in person in February and March 2023.\nThe first author and five research assistants conducted the personal surveys. Research assistants were recruited from among university students and received training by attending lectures during face-to-face interviews. They stood at the front doors of supermarkets and approached every shopper when they finished shopping. First, the shoppers were asked whether they were willing to participate. Participants were fully informed about the purpose of the survey and how their data would be used. Seven hundred and seventy-four responses (124 online and 650 in-person) were collected. The in-person surveys were conducted on both weekdays and weekends to avoid bias.\nTable 1\npresents the respondents’ profiles. Approximately 244 people refused to answer the questionnaire; the major reason for rejection was that they were busy and in a hurry to leave.\n2.2. Data Analysis\nA binary logistic regression model predicted correlations between motivation and respondents’ socioeconomic and demographic features. Data were analyzed using Stata Version 15.1. The open-ended comments in the previous section were translated into English and analyzed using KH Coder software (Version: 3.Beta.08a) [\n52\n].\n2.3. Binary Logistic Regression and Variables\nThe respondents’ socioeconomic characteristics and motivations for urban farming practices were assumed to significantly influence their participation. To test this hypothesis, a binary logistic model was used, in which the dependent variable, participation in urban farming, was a dichotomous variable with two possible options: whether a resident did or did not practice urban farming. The dependent variable was coded 0 for those who did not engage in urban farming and 1 for those with experience with urban farming.\nA binary logistic regression model was applied to predict the effects of differences in motivation and respondents’ economic and demographic characteristics on their experiences of urban farming practices.\np\ny\n=\n1\n1\n+\ne\n1\n(\nb\n0\n+\nb\n1\nx\n1\n+\nb\n2\nx\n2\n+\n…\nb\ni\nx\ni\n)\n(1)\nIn Equation (1), p(y) represents the probability of urban farming for dependent variable y,\nb\nis the coefficient of the independent variables or predictors, and\nx\nis the independent variable, as listed in\nTable 2\n. The\nx\ns include motivations expressed according to the 5-point Likert scale and respondents’ social, economic, and demographic features.\n3. Results\n3.1. Profiles of Respondents\nThe respondents’ age profiles (\nTable 1\n) differed somewhat from their respective profiles in the Okinawa population. However, the number of female respondents exceeded that of male respondents. Most of the 774 respondents (81%) had household incomes lower than JPY six million. Almost one-third (30.6%) of the respondents had stable jobs as teachers or public servants. Approximately one-third of respondents had a bachelor’s degree.\n3.2. Knowledge of Respondents on Urban Farming\nRespondents’ experiences and knowledge pertinent to urban farming are presented in\nTable 3\n. Regarding the question, ‘Have you known about urban farming before?’, only 12% said that they knew about it, over half (53.2%) answered that they had never heard about it, and one-third (35%) said they had just heard the word but had not understood it.\nApproximately one-third (36.8%) of the 747 respondents had relevant experience in urban farming, whereas two-thirds (63.2%) did not have the relevant experience. Those who had not experienced urban farming (472 respondents) were asked whether they planned to do so soon after. Most (77.2%) respondents did not plan to conduct urban farming, whereas only 22.6% said that they planned to do so.\nRespondents were asked about their urban farming style (vacant land in urban areas, allotment gardens, gardens around houses, and apartment balconies). Most (265 respondents, 94.3%) said that they used the gardens around their houses or the apartments’ balconies. Among those who did not engage in farming but planned to do so soon (122 responses), approximately 96% of the respondents said they wanted to try farming in the garden or the apartment balcony.\n3.3. Motivations toward Urban Farming\nRespondents were asked to report their motivations for engaging in urban farming on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly disagree” (1) to “Strongly agree” (5) (\nTable 4\n).\nRegarding the motivations for urban farming, the descending order of the mean Likert scale for each motivation was as follows: eating fresh vegetables (4.5), eating pesticide-free vegetables (4.3), improving health and physical fitness (4.1), interacting with green spaces (4.0), growing local vegetables (3.8), feeling at ease through farming (3.5), spending time with friends and family members (3.4), love of farming (3.3), farming with family (3.2), creating shade to cool the house (2.9), managing vacant land in urban areas (2.7), feeling safer outside because of COVID-19 (2.6), and nowhere to go because of COVID-19 (2.5) (\nFigure 4\n).\nRegarding the relationship between COVID-19 and home garden practices, most respondents held a negative attitude toward the effectiveness of outside gardening during the pandemic. Of all motivation responses, “feeling safer outside because of COVID-19” and “nowhere to go because of COVID-19” ranked at the bottom of all responses, which implied that societal changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic had not changed the motivations of surveyed urbanites for urban gardening/farming.\n3.4. Binary Logistic Regression Results\nLogistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of motivations for urban farming (food safety, physical fitness, mental health, and interactions with family and friends) on the urban farming experience and future planning. The logistic regression model showed statistical significance (\np\n< 0.0005). The model explained 20.6% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in urban farming practices and correctly classified 62.5% of the cases (\nTable 5\n). The results of the logistic regression analysis are presented in\nTable 6\n. Increasing age was associated with an increased likelihood of urban farming experience; respondents older than 60 were 1.7 times more likely to practice urban farming. A higher motivation to “grow local vegetables” or “interact with green space” or based on “loving farming” was associated with a higher possibility of urban farming practice. The respondents with a higher motivation to “grow local vegetables” or “interact with green space” or due to “loving farming” were 1.36, 1.29, and 1.46 times more likely to practice urban farming, respectively.\nA cross-table analysis (\nTable 7\n) of the respondents’ age and experience in urban farming showed that those over 40 years old were more likely to have urban farming experience. More than half of the respondents aged >70 years were engaged in urban farming.\nRegarding the relationship of age with their plan to engage in urban farming in the future, respondents of 40–49 years had the highest rate, accounting for one-fourth (25.3%), followed by those aged 60–69 years old (22.6%) (see\nTable 8\n).\n3.5. Perceptions and Attitudes toward Urban Farming\nAn analysis of respondents’ suggestions and comments on urban farming is presented in\nTable 9\n. We received informative comments from 141 respondents. Approximately 20% of the respondents desired to practice farming if they could find a small piece of vacant land to produce safe and sweet vegetables in their living areas. Two participants said they might try the planter and grow vegetables on the balcony. One of the respondents wanted to engage in farming after retirement. Another six respondents (4.3%) mentioned that they would actively participate in urban farming if they could find a piece of land close to them. Thirteen respondents (9.2%) said they did not know how to grow vegetables, and another nine (6.4%) said that farming was difficult; this may suggest easy-to-grow crops as a suitable beginning.\nSix respondents (4.3%) noted challenges; for example, disposal of used land and control of the smell of the fertilizer did not affect their neighborhood. Eighteen respondents (12.8%) said it was the first time they had heard about “urban farming” terminology or did not understand its meaning. Concerning the function of urban farming, 18 respondents (12.8%) said that urban farming is significant and necessary in the future of Japan, and another 20 respondents (14.2%) stated that urban farming can enhance the crop self-sufficiency rate in the social context of high living costs and expensive fresh vegetables. Many respondents stated that urban farming could provide environmental benefits, improve health, and increase green spaces. Ten respondents said that the development of urban farming could effectively utilize abandoned land and vacant land in urban areas and revitalize the region. Eleven respondents (7.8%) said that urban agriculture, such as community gardens, could provide a place of exchange for the elderly. Another ten respondents (7.1%) expressed that urban farming could be utilized as food education for kids and prevent aging-related diseases.\nCrop cultivation methods, technologies, and institutional support were also mentioned. Many were interested in local crops like bitter melon and wished to grow vegetables without pesticides. However, many (13 respondents, 9.2%) said that they did not have farming knowledge and needed seminars or workshops to learn about farming. Another nine respondents (6.4%) said that they wanted more information related to urban farming. One respondent looked at allotment gardens or community gardens as a tool for regional revitalization, stating that support from the private sector and local governments is needed. Six respondents (4.3%) stated that applications for allotment gardens were too competitive.\n4. Discussion\nApproximately one-third of the respondents practiced urban farming; the majority of these practiced farming surrounding their houses or apartment buildings, and the area was comparatively small, revealing that the most popular urban farming in Okinawa was the home garden type. A small number (6%) of respondents farming in allotment gardens revealed the underdevelopment of allotment gardens or other types of community gardens in Okinawa. It is estimated that there will be 4235 allotment gardens open by 2022 and 3.5 million urban gardeners [\n53\n]. Okinawa has only 19 allotment gardens, with a total area of 8 ha and 1014 plots. Challenges to promoting urban farming included the unavailability of urban farming knowledge and of allotment gardens, and potential negative environmental influences on neighborhoods. Land competition is a common issue in other regions [\n31\n,\n32\n], involving land tenure [\n33\n,\n34\n,\n35\n], soil quality, and contamination [\n32\n].\nIn contrast, many community gardens have been developed and promoted in the United States [\n54\n], the Netherlands [\n55\n], the United Kingdom [\n56\n], Portugal [\n57\n], and Singapore [\n27\n]. Urban farms supported by agricultural organizations can attract young users because of their easy access to relevant educational programs for new users [\n58\n]. Despite the benefits generated by community gardens, the number of community gardens is much lower in Japan than in other developed countries, and academic research in this field is largely lacking, except for a few case studies [\n24\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n58\n]. The American Community Gardening Association estimates 18,000 community gardens in the United States and Canada. The number of Americans growing their food at home and in community gardens has increased from 36 million in 2008 to 42 million in 2013. Young people, particularly millennials (aged 18–34 years), are the fastest-growing population of food gardeners [\n59\n,\n60\n].\nThe benefits of urban farming considered by Okinawan urbanites were safe and fresh food, improved health, and enjoyment of green spaces; they did not differ much from those in other regions of the world [\n14\n,\n22\n,\n29\n,\n49\n]. Japanese urbanites are highly concerned about pesticide use in vegetable cultivation and prefer to eat fresh and pesticide-free vegetables. Few studies in the United States have quantified the impact of community gardens on low-income gardeners’ food and nutrient intake. It was found that community gardeners consumed cruciferous vegetables and dark green leafy vegetables and consumed fewer baked goods and soft drinks than their non-gardening counterparts [\n4\n]. Additionally, urban gardeners are more likely to be motivated to plant local crops, interact with green spaces, and love farming. Local crops that are not commonly accessible in the market have motivated the growth of urban farming. Participants’ enthusiasm for farming and farming skills motivated them to engage in it.\nExcept for age, respondents’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were not significantly correlated with their willingness to engage in urban farming practices. This case study in Okinawa found that more than one-third of respondents over 40 were engaged in urban farming. A recent survey in Nagoya City, a major city in Japan, reported that over 80% of allotment gardeners were older than 60 [\n51\n]. The difference between this case study and others in the big cities of Japan lies in the tradition of home gardening in Okinawan history and the accessibility of home gardening surrounding people’s houses or apartments. One-sixth of the respondents stated that they wanted to engage in urban farming. One-fourth of potential future urban farmers were in their 40s (25.3%) or 60s (22.6%). Both of these groups had more free time, either because their children had grown up or they were retired.\nThe finding that the respondents did not appreciate the social benefits of urban farming is inconsistent with results from other regions worldwide. The motivations of “farm with family” and “spend time with friends and family” were ranked seventh and eighth most important on average. This may be because most participants were home gardeners, and only a few allotment gardeners participated in the research. Recent studies from 2020–2022 revealed that social benefits were most appreciated [\n49\n,\n61\n]. In this study, the two motivations pertinent to COVID-19, “feel safer outside because of COVID-19” and “nowhere to go because of COVID-19”, were ranked lowest among all the motivations, revealing that the respondents did not consider urban farming as an escape from social isolation and lockdown. This inconsistency may be due to two reasons: one is the characteristics of urban farmers, particularly allotment gardeners, who reported that the users did not actively communicate, and the other is that the major style of urban farming is to use the land surrounding one’s residence. The Japanese researchers argued that the allotment garden is not a “place for exchange” or “emotional education for children”, and that the facilities and equipment of the garden should be improved from the citizens’ viewpoint. Kataoka [\n62\n], based on a survey in Machida City, argued that, unlike the German Klein Garten, Japanese allotment gardens do not function as places for citizen interaction. The main purpose of most citizen farm users was to grow safe vegetables for the elderly, with only a few families participating. Allotment gardens in Japan are not places of exchange “or children’s emotional education” [\n63\n]. Most allotment garden users do not seek to interact with other users. However, the gradual relationship between acquaintances and the extending of greetings as people share the same place are widely fostered among users. Although there are only a few, some take the opportunity to participate in activities in public gardens to develop friendships. A survey on the community garden established by the non farming enterprises flourished in Tokyo to satisfy the growing urban residents’ needs for convenient location in the city center and sufficient services and infrastructure [\n59\n].\nThe finding that respondents had low concern regarding environmental benefits and urban regeneration in terms of managing vacant urban land and providing shade to houses was highly different from the results for their Western counterparts. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) defines an urban farm as providing fresh food, farmland to experience agriculture, open spaces in case of disasters, and green spaces that regulate microclimate and recreational opportunities. However, the finding that citizens do not fully understand the official concepts of urban farming reveals that the Ministry can play a pivotal role in promoting urban farming, for example, by developing and implementing supportive policies and regulations. The MAFF can provide grants and subsidies for urban farming initiatives, making it financially feasible for individuals and communities to start and maintain urban gardens. Additionally, the Ministry can offer educational programs and resources to increase public awareness and knowledge of the benefits of urban farming. By collaborating with local governments and community organizations, the MAFF can help create a robust support network that encourages urban agriculture and integrates it into city planning and development.\n5. Conclusions\nThe goal of maximizing the social functions of urban farming, allotments, and community gardens should be promoted in Japan. Community gardens are exchange spaces for the elderly, particularly important in the super-aging world. However, increasing competition for space and environmental constraints often limit the capacity to establish urban agriculture systems in city areas, and the negative aspects of urban agriculture can create hazards to the natural environment and local communities. Further expansion and development of urban agriculture as productive green infrastructure will require cautious planning strategies that maximize environmental and social benefits while taking advantage of vacant or underutilized pockets of urban land. Urban planning will incorporate urban agriculture more widely as another land-use type in urban space economies. This study suggests that urban gardens deserve a position in urban green space management, as they may help address societal challenges such as urbanization, health and well-being in aging populations, and climate adaptation.\nHowever, community gardens do not automatically create communities. The social networks established by gardens may contribute to health-enabling cohesive communities. To maximize the health benefits, it is useful to make urban gardens accessible to many people, including the elderly and young. Building a strong and vibrant community in a garden involves creating a welcoming and inclusive environment where people can connect, learn, and collaborate. Many respondents found it difficult to engage in farming with related knowledge; hence, host workshops and educational sessions on gardening techniques, composting, and sustainable practices were conducted to promote learning and skill sharing. Ensure that your community garden welcomes people of all backgrounds, ages, and skill levels. Diversity and inclusivity should be encouraged to create a rich tapestry for gardeners with different perspectives and experiences. Encourage members to share excess produce or donate it to local food banks and shelters; this reduces food waste and fosters a sense of community generosity. Designate a communal space within the garden where members can relax, socialize, or hold gatherings. A picnic area or a shared seating space can be a focal point for community interaction. Collaborate with local community organizations, schools, or businesses to garner community garden support, resources, and volunteers.\nThis case study had several limitations. This survey used a combination of online and in-person approaches. It should be noted that university students, comprising one-third of the surveyed respondents, may have introduced bias. This survey of urban residents revealed that most farmers planted vegetables or fruit trees around their houses. There are 19 allotment gardens and 1014 plots in Okinawa [\n53\n]. However, knowledge of urban gardening in Japan is lacking. Hence, more case studies are required to understand the challenges and societal problems of extending allotment gardens to other urban farms. In our next study, we will survey allotment gardeners to reveal the perceived benefits of and motivations for urban farming.\nFuture research should investigate the sociocultural factors influencing urban farming motivations and practices across different age groups and demographics. Longitudinal studies examining the long-term benefits and challenges of urban farming in super-aging societies such as Japan would provide valuable insights into sustainable urban agriculture practices. Comparative studies of urban farming practices in Japan and other industrialized Asian countries highlight unique regional challenges and effective strategies. Exploring the impact of technological innovations such as vertical farming and IoT-based agriculture on urban farming efficiency and productivity is also essential. Finally, future research should investigate the role of policy frameworks and community engagement initiatives in fostering a supportive environment for urban farming, thereby addressing knowledge gaps and promoting broader participation among urban residents.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: B.C.; data curation, formal analysis, funding acquisition: B.C., K.M., T.N., D.K. and M.A.; investigation: B.C., K.M. and M.A.; methodology: B.C.; project administration: B.C., K.M. and T.N.; resources: B.C. and D.K.; software: B.C.; supervision: B.C., K.M. and T.N.; validation: B.C.; visualization: B.C.; roles/writing—original draft: B.C.; and writing—review and editing: B.C., K.M., T.N., M.A., D.K. and S.S.

        "abstract": "Background: A large body of evidence connects access to greenspace with substantial benefits to physical and mental health. In urban settings where access to greenspace can be limited, park access and use have been associated with higher levels of physical activity, improved physical health, and lower levels of markers of mental distress. Despite the potential health benefits of urban parks, little is known about how park usage varies across locations (between or within cities) or over time. Methods: We estimated park usage among urban residents (identified as residents of urban census tracts) in 498 US cities from 2019 to 2021 from aggregated and anonymised opted-in smartphone location history data. We used descriptive statistics to quantify differences in park usage over time, between cities, and across census tracts within cities, and used generalised linear models to estimate the associations between park usage and census tract level descriptors. Findings: In spring (March 1 to May 31) 2019, 18·9% of urban residents visited a park at least once per week, with average use higher in northwest and southwest USA, and lowest in the southeast. Park usage varied substantially both within and between cities; was unequally distributed across census tract-level markers of race, ethnicity, income, and social vulnerability; and was only moderately correlated with established markers of census tract greenspace. In spring 2019, a doubling of walking time to parks was associated with a 10·1% (95% CI 5·6–14·3) lower average weekly park usage, adjusting for city and social vulnerability index. The median decline in park usage from spring 2019 to spring 2020 was 38·0% (IQR 28·4–46·5), coincident with the onset of physical distancing policies across much of the country. We estimated that the COVID-19-related decline in park usage was more pronounced for those living further from a park and those living in areas of higher social vulnerability. Interpretation: These estimates provide novel insights into the patterns and correlates of park use and could enable new studies of the health benefits of urban greenspace. In addition, the availability of an empirical park usage metric that varies over time could be a useful tool for assessing the effectiveness of policies intended to increase such activities.

UP is the largest component of urban green space (UGS) however other components are all green areas like gardens, greenery, woodland, lawns, trees, and parks (Adinolfi et al.,\n2014\n; Ki & Lee,\n2021\n). It is a kind of public open space in the urban ecosystems (Rakhshandehroo et al.,\n2017\n). It is an indicator of the quality of urban life and plays a crucial role in preserving the natural environment (Xing et al.,\n2018\n). It is an integral part of urban life and offers multiple benefits for the improvement of the quality of life such as physical and psychological health, social cohesion, and the environmental, economic, and aesthetic aspects of urban living (Lee et al.,\n2015\n). It also mitigates the urban heat island problem (Huang et al.,\n2018\n) and purifies the air (Jaafari et al.,\n2020\n). Moreover, urban dwellers enjoy various types of cultural ecosystem services such as relaxation and restoration, visual appreciation, and education (Surya et al.,\n2020\n). For these reasons, urban greenery is popularly known as the green lungs of the city (Claudiu,\n2013\n; Jennings et al.,\n2012\n; Jones,\n2018\n; Lahoti et al.,\n2020\n). UP promotes better health and well-being by minimizing the health risk of chronic diseases, and improving self-esteem temperament (Ward Thompson et al.,\n2012\n).\nWHO estimates that 17 million people (30%) died in 2005 due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and nearly 80% of these deaths occurred in low and middle-income nations like India (Upadhyay,\n2012\n). In addition, 60 percent of all deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in India (National Health Mission,\n2018\n). Many studies argued that the health risks of lifestyle-related NCDs (such as CVD, psychological disorders, coronary heart disease (CHD), obesity, chronic disease, diabetes, breast and colon cancer, and shortened life expectancy) get reduced through regular PA (Lee et al.,\n2013\n; Sallis et al.,\n2012\n; Tamosiunas et al.,\n2014\n). The World Health Organization (WHO,\n2016\n) published a report on promoting physical activity, greater social interaction, and relaxation using green spaces. The World Health Organization (WHO,\n2010\n) stated that physical inactivity is the fourth leading health risk in the world. PA significantly maintains human health and well-being (Akpinar,\n2016\n) by enhancing mental temperament (Barton & Pretty,\n2010\n). Several studies identified four significant elements that determine the impact of UGS on PA, such as availability, accessibility, attractiveness, and attachment (Du et al.,\n2021\n; WHO,\n2021\n; Zhang et al.,\n2021\n). According to Stessens et al. (\n2020\n), some attractive elements of urban parks like peacefulness, cleanliness, well-maintained facilities, and safety are associated with health and well-being. The PA level is high where multiple amenities and facilities are available, including playgrounds, tennis courts, foot tracks, sitting arrangements, shadows, toilets, bathrooms, water bodies, sports grounds, foot-track, and fitness equipment (Kaczynski et al.,\n2008\n; Kothencz et al.,\n2017\n). The quality of greenery attracts people to maintain a quality of life (van Dillen et al.,\n2012\n). Therefore, the characteristics of UPs promote PA. Despite having a promising role, the potential of UPs is deteriorating due to an over-increased as well as unplanned urbanization, and improper planning (Ahmadi et al.,\n2017\n; Gelan,\n2021\n).\nOne of the greatest challenges in the twenty-first century is to supply appropriate amenities and facilities to the urban residents to lead a healthy urban life. Hence, well-planned and well-designed attractive urban parks are compulsory to bring proper value to urban residents in a sustainable manner (Giles-Corti et al.,\n2005\n). Meanwhile, the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) has set a target to provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces (UN General Assembly,\n2015\n). According to the United Nations, the population of cities is expected to increase to 68.4% by 2050 (United Nations,\n2017\n). Therefore, urbanization without proper planning will lead a land scarcity, urban green scarcity, and blue scarcity, declining park quality and quantity in highly dense cities like Kolkata. The study argues on whether or not all parks do have equal potential to attract the city residents? What are the important characteristics of a park to make it an enough potential for healthy city living of community residents? The study analyses the relative rank of the infrastructure of UPs and demarcates the zone of potential level of UPs in Kolkata, in perspective of physical activity and human health.\nLiterature review\nParks have a significant role in promoting physical activity, human health, and well-being, though the levels of PA depend on its multiple factors, namely the presence of attractive amenities and facilities, well-designed landscapes, proper maintenance, largeness, availability, and accessibility (Akpinar,\n2016\n; Biernacka et al.,\n2019\n; Comber et al.,\n2008\n; Hanna et al.,\n2021\n; Kim et al.,\n2019\n). Earlier research studies have focused on quantitative variables in terms of availability, accessibility, and per capita parks (Jarvis et al.,\n2020\n; Veitch et al.,\n2016\n), spatial distribution patterns, and ecological benefits (Du et al.,\n2020\n; Huang et al.,\n2021\n; Ji et al.,\n2020\n; Pan et al.,\n2021\n; Wei et al.,\n2022\n). However, most of the research studies have overlooked the qualitative assessment, particularly the park infrastructures for promoting physical activity using geospatial tools such as park size, sports ground, foot track, jogging instruments, toilet and bathroom, drinking water, multiple types of trees, accessibility and connectivity, and presence of tree shade.\nSeveral studies have already been conducted on qualitative attributes, such as park area, safety, maintenance, aesthetic features, distance, and associated benefits (Akpinar,\n2016\n; Ayala-Azcárraga et al.,\n2019\n; Francis et al.,\n2012\n; Kaczynski et al.,\n2008\n; McCormack et al.,\n2010\n; Van Herzele & Wiedemann,\n2003\n; Zhang et al.,\n2017\n), although these studies have some limitations, which are to be discussed systematically. Akpinar (\n2016\n) investigated the association between quality of infrastructure and self-reported PA using multivariate linear regression through a survey method. This study suggests that well-maintained, large-sized, and high-quality parks motivate individuals to engage in PA. The study observed that the quality of parks promotes PA to improve health. Ayala-Azcárraga et al., (\n2019\n) investigated the association between the characteristics of green spaces and users' well-being using a questionnaire method. The study found that the quality, cleanliness, distance, safety, plenty of trees, and playgrounds are associated with better well-being. However, the study did not identify the area as potentially attractive using geospatial tools. Another study highlighted that the quality, accessibility, and usability of greenery enhance the neighbourhood's satisfaction. However, the study did not determine the potential zones of parks (Zhang et al.,\n2017\n). Zhang et al., (\n2021\n), conducted a study in Singapore to measure the quantitative elements of UGS (vegetation cover, canopy cover, and park area) using GIS and quantified the greenness quality based on Google Street view panoramic images. However, this study overlooked the qualitative aspects of UGS, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. Kaczynski et al. (\n2008\n) investigated the physical activity level of 33 selected parks based on park size, distance, and various features using environmental assessment for public recreation space instruments. The study used logistic regression to examine the relative importance of the variables. This study found that attractive features are more crucial than distance and size for physical activity purposes. However, the study did not employ any tools to determine the quality of parks. Another study was conducted in Kolkata to investigate the suitability of parks based on a rating scale for the seven attributes of sanitation, safety, security, noise, blue space, children’s playground, and historical importance (Dinda & Ghosh,\n2021\n). This study found 65 major parks and considered only six parks to measure their suitability. However, the study overlooked all existing parks in the analysis.\nExtensive research studies have established a positive association between park infrastructures and users’ health and well-being (Akpınar,\n2019\n; Kondo et al.,\n2018\n; Mytton et al.,\n2012\n). However, no prior studies have assessed the quality of park infrastructures and identified their potential zones using a GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. Hence, this study aims to bridge this gap by enriching additional information on this particular topic.\nStudy area\nThe Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has been selected as the study area because it is one of the most densely urbanized cities in India. It covers an area of 185 km\n2\nand comprises 141 wards (Fig.\n1\n) and 16 boroughs (Census of India\n2011\n). It is situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River in the famous deltaic Bengal basin. As per the census records, the city accommodates 4,496,694 persons, a population density of 24,306 persons per km\n2\n(Census of India\n2011\n). It is highly urbanized and one of the oldest cities in India. The present study has 752 urban parks, and open space is rarely available to develop new urban parks. Dinda et al., (\n2021\n) found the urban built-up increased from 92.71 km\n2\nin 1980 to 148.30 km\n2\nin 2018 in Kolkata. Hence, increasing built-up and decreasing vegetation may create a space crisis to develop new parks shortly.\nFig. 1\nLocation map of the study area\nFull size image\nMaterials and methods\nData sources\nThe present study has identified 752 urban parks that are publicly accessible, managed, and covered by a variety of colorful trees, canopy trees, and grass and shrubs, where people perform physical activities. The geographical location of these parks, and their size (in hectare), were gathered using GPS (Garmin GPS Etrex 10). Information related to the park amenities and facilities was obtained through a field investigation in all parks with a purposively designed survey schedule. The responses have been recorded in a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with park-users in all parks in the study. In absence of park-user in the survey-time, local people were involved to provide the information as well as their opinion on selected criteria. Responses have been measured on a 3-point Likert scale as \"poor/not available,\" \"moderate,\" and \"high,” (Table\n1\n).\nTable 1 Criteria, sub-criteria and their rank with descriptions\nFull size table\nAn assessment of the park quality and demarcation of zone of potential levels has been performed based on 13 criteria are park size (PS), maintenance of sports ground (MSG), maintenance of foot track (MFT), availability of vegetation (AV), accessibility and connectivity (AC), toilet and bathroom (TB), drinking water (DW), presence of dustbin (PD), fitness equipment (FE), per day average number of users (PAU), beautification of aesthetic features (BAF), degree of safety and maintenance (DSM), and shadow of trees (ST) (Table\n1\nand Fig.\n2\n).\nFig. 2\nFlowchart of research design of the study\nFull size image\nThe geographical boundary in terms of ward and borough unit of KMC has been obtained from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation website (\nhttps://www.kmcgov.idegreeortal/downloads/Final_Notification_v4_Corrected_with_MC_SIG_12-10-11.pdf\n). To evaluate the existing characteristics of UPs, this study employed a GIS-based MCDM and AHP model to demarcate the potential zones of urban parks. This technique has been adopted by various researchers for the same purpose (Anteneh et al.,\n2023\n; Jabir and Arun,\n2014\n; Abebe & Megento,\n2017\n; Chandio et al.,\n2011\n; Dagıstanlı et al.,\n2018\n; Elahe et al.,\n2014\n; Gelan,\n2021\n; Li et al.,\n2018\n). The details procedure of the study is represented in Fig.\n2\n.\nWeight determining criteria using Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)\nAHP is most important method of identifying most influential factors (Berhanu & Hatiye,\n2020\n). The GIS-based MCDM is an admirable evaluation tool that analyses multiple criteria using GIS tools (Mahmoud,\n2014\n). This study adopted the AHP model as developed by Thomas Saaty (Ali & Ahmad,\n2019\n; Saaty,\n1977\n,\n1987\n). The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is extensively used in the MCDM method, which enables researchers to systematically evaluate the multiple criteria and sub-criteria. It analyzes both qualitative and quantitative data in a complex system (Li et al.,\n2018\n). In AHP, the selection of criteria and sub-criteria is a pivotal stage, since the criteria affect the judgement process by distinguishing one from other and assigning more weight to the criteria used. There are no universally accepted criteria in the context of urban green space planning. Therefore, to determine the criteria, this study explored long range of literature reviews, field observations (Table\n2\n). In the MCDM pairwise comparison matrix process, some essential steps are required to identify the potential zones of the UP.\nTable 2 Random index (RI) corresponding to the number of evaluation criteria\nFull size table\nThe first step was to set a goal (Table\n3\n). The main aim of this study was to identify the potential zones of UP. The second step was to determine the relative weights of the criteria crucial for identifying the potential zones of urban parks. Thirteen criteria were considered for this analysis (Table\n4\n). The third step was to define the weights for each criterion based on their importance, using the Saaty 1 – 9 scale (Table\n3\n). The study adopted GIS-based MCDM and AHP techniques to assign weights for each criterion. This technique is the most powerful for the selection of criteria, evaluating their significance, comparing the alternative choices for each criterion, and ultimately determining a comprehensive ranking of alternatives. A pairwise comparison matrix was formulated, wherein each criterion was systematically assessed for its relative importance using a scale ranging from 1 to 9 (Ali & Ahmad,\n2019\n) (Table\n4\n). A relative weight must be assigned to each selected criterion because they may not have the same weight or significance in a particular case. These priorities are considered relative because they are assessed according to their importance within a given context. To quantify the weights of the criteria, pairwise comparisons were performed to create a comparison matrix. The pairs of criteria Ci (in the row) and Cj (in the column) were analyzed based on; 1) which criterion was more important—Ci or Cj, and 2) how much it was more important than the less important criterion. A normalized weight was calculated by dividing each Ci (row value) by the total value for each column. The pairwise comparison matrix provides criteria weights using the average of each criterion in comparison with all others (Table\n5\n). Once the comparison ranks were established, the weighting of each alternative was calculated to assess the consistency of inclusion in the decision-making process. After then, the lamda (\n\\(\\uplambda\\)\n) was calculated using AW/W, where the weighted sum is denoted by ‘Aw’, and Criteria Weight is denoted by ‘W’. The Lamda Max was calculated using the average of lamda (\n\\(\\uplambda\\)\n) as shown in Eq.\n1\n:\nTable 3 The Fundamental rating scale of Saaty\nFull size table\nTable 4 Pair-wise comparison matrix (Weights and scores of criteria)\nFull size table\nTable 5 Normalized pair-wise comparison matrix and criteria weights\nFull size table\n$$\\mathrm{\\lambda Lamda}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{AW}}{\\mathrm W}\\\\$$\n(1)\nIt is necessary to check whether the result is consistent. Since all the ranks were derived through subjective preferences, there is a high chance of having some partiality in making the final judgment of the matrix. However, the question is how much consistency is acceptable in this matrix. The consistency ratio (CR) was introduced by Saaty in 1980 to measure the level of weight of the parameters (Saaty,\n1980\n).\nFor this purpose, the AHP provides a measure of the consistency ratio of the pairwise comparison matrix. This is achieved by computing the Consistency Ratio (CR), which compares the Consistency Index (CI) of the matrix (Eq.\n2\n). It provides the calculated Random Index (RI) values for matrices of various alternative sizes (T. L. Saaty,\n1977\n,\n1980\n,\n1988\n).\n$$\\mathrm{CI}=\\frac{\\lambda \\mathrm{max}-\\mathrm{n}} {\\mathrm{n}-1}$$\n(2)\nMaximum Eigen value (\n\\(\\uplambda\\)\nmax) = 14.5642,\nn\n= 13, and Consistency index (CI) = 0.1304.\nConsistency is the ratio between the consistency index (CI) and random index (RI) (T. L. Saaty,\n1977\n,\n1988\n). In this method, if the ratio value exceeds 0.10, then it is considered inconsistent for judgment and the value 0 is considered as perfectly consistent. In the present study, the consistency ratio (CR) stands at 0.084, falling below the 0.10 threshold, indicating its acceptability. Therefore, the pairwise comparison matrix was consistent.\n$$\\mathrm{CR}=\\frac{\\mathrm{CI}}{\\mathrm{RI}}$$\n(3)\nConsistency ratio (CR) = 0.0835.\nPreparation of thematic map and Weighted overlay analysis (WOA) using geospatial techniques\nPrimary survey-based data of 13 criteria of 752 UP were input in the ArcGIS. Along with the GPS survey-based geographical location, the UP was prepared in a point-shaped file. By combining two files in ArcGIS, all thematic maps were prepared separately using inverse distance weighted interpolation techniques (IDW) of GIS. The 13 thematic maps of each criterion were prepared based on the primary data (Table\n1\nand Fig.\n3\n). Keeping this in mind, each criterion was categorized into three levels based on the ratings of existing UP infrastructures. For the standardization and maintaining the rank order of the existing condition of UP, all the prepared IDW maps were reclassified into three levels i.e., ‘poor/not available,’ ‘moderate,’ and ‘high’. Thus, 13 separate thematic maps were prepared. The weighted overlay analysis tool allows the calculation of multiple criteria analysis among several raster maps and combines the different layers for the final result. In the weighted overlay dialogue box, all the raster maps were added one by one, along with the criteria weights added in their respective influence dialogue box (Fig.\n4\n). Finally, a three-layer potential zones map was prepared for the study to call poor potential, moderate potential, and high potential zones. In addition, the study identified the location of the potential park based on the three potential zones, which were identified using the ‘clip’ function of the geo-processing tool of GIS (Fig.\n5\n).\nFig. 3\nReclassified maps of Urban Parks in KMC based on geospatial tool\nFull size image\nFig. 4\nPhoto plates of existing amenities and facilities in the parks of KMC\nFull size image\nFig. 5\nZone of Potential levels of Urban Parks in KMC based on MCDM-AHP Criteria\nFull size image\nResult\nMCDM-AHP criteria\nAHP findings reveal a relative importance of different criteria and their role in potential zone delineation of UPs. Table\n4\ndisplays a pair-wise comparison matrix of 13 selected criteria of UP. The matrix compares the relative importance of each criterion with every other criterion using Saaty’s scale of relative importance. The value in the matrix indicates the importance of one criterion over another, with higher values indicating a greater preference. Table\n5\nrepresents the relative weights of these criteria. Keeping this in mind, the value of each criterion of the normalized comparison pairwise matrix must be equal to 1.00, and the effect value must be 100. Suppose the criteria weight of the park size is 0.17, indicating a 17% influence on the park-potential. It is evident from Table\n5\nthat park size is a most prioritized and dominant criterion (0.17) in measuring potential of parks, followed by availability of vegetation (0.13), maintenance of sports ground (0.12), foot track (0.12), fitness equipment (0.10), degree of safety and maintenance (0.09), and beautification of aesthetic features (0.07). In contrast, toilets and bathrooms, drinking water, and the presence of dustbin has similar weights (0.2). However, both criteria ‘accessibility and connectivity’ and ‘magnitude of park use’ obtained 0.04 weight, and the criteria ‘shadow of trees’ obtained 0.06 weight. It was observed that park facilities were the most dominant criteria for measuring the potential of parks. In this study, park size, sports grounds, foot tracks, and jogging instruments were the most attractive as well as essential facilities of the park, and the rest of the attributes were amenities. This analysis is effective for planners and policymakers to identify potential parks in urban areas.\nWeight and rank to the criteria and sub-criteria\nThis section analyses the criteria and sub-criteria, along with the relative weights of each criterion (Table\n6\n). This study also explains the areas occupied by each sub-criterion. In addition, the study identifies the number of parks that fall under each sub-criterion. This section presents results of criteria weights for measurement of park-potential.\nTable 6 Summary of weights, and ranks\nFull size table\nPark Size (Area in Ha)\nPark size (ha) is recognised as the most influential and predominant criterion with 17% criteria-effect among the all-selected infrastructure criteria of UP (Table\n6\nand\n3\na). It was found that the moderate size of parks covers the maximum area (48.11%) and share of parks (44.41%) (Table\n6\nand Fig.\n3\na). The park sizes of more than 0.500 ha size of parks are distributed over only 15.77% of KMC’s areas; therefore, it is evident that a higher number of parks are distributed within a limited area. The WHO recommends that there should be accessible green spaces of at least 0.500 ha within 300 m (linear distance) from residential areas (WHO Regional Office for Europe,\n2017\n). A Park size of less than 0.099 ha occupies 36.12% of the city area, although the number of parks in this region is 318. The overall results highlight that large-size parks are few in KMC. Rabindra Sarovar, Victoria Memorial, Subhas Sarovar, Deshapriya Park, and Deshbondhu Park are large size parks (Fig.\n4\na).\nMaintenance of sports ground\nThe existence of sports fields is used for playing football, and cricket. This section assesses the availability and maintenance of sports grounds in the parks. Its criteria weight is 0.12 with 12% criteria-effect, and ranks third among the 13 criteria. The study reveals that approximately 41 percent of the parks do not have available sports grounds. In contrast, only 19.66% of parks had well-maintained sports grounds. Figure\n3\nb shows that sports facilities are unavailable in the outer portion of KMC, and well-maintained sports grounds are found mostly in the central and southeastern parts of the KMC, namely Deshbondhu and Rabindra Sarovar, respectively (Fig.\n4\nb and c).\nMaintenance of foot tracks\nFootpaths and tracks are being used for the running, walking, and cycling. PA and attractiveness are associated with the foot-tracks and walking paths in parks (Zhai & Baran,\n2017\n). The presence of a maintained foot track promotes PA and utilization of parks. This section evaluates the availability and maintenance of foot tracks of UP. The criteria weight of it is 0.12 (Table\n6\n), which is similar to the sports ground. It ranks 3rd among all criteria. The study observed that the not well-maintained parks (Fig.\n4\ne) are large number (46.72%) than not demarcated at all, and demarcated with well-maintained parks (Fig.\n4\nd). It is observed that a large number of park either don’t have this facility or have unmaintained which discourage PA on it (Table\n6\nand Fig.\n3\nc). Most of the high-quality parks are located in the middle to western part of the KMC, while western part of KMC has no foot track (Fig.\n3\nc).\nAvailability of vegetation\nThis section analyzes the presence of various types of vegetation in parks. The weight of this criterion is 0.13, rank 2 among all infrastructures (Table\n6\n). The quality of parks depends on the availability of vegetation type like grass, shrubs/variety of trees/colourful plants/colourful flowers/canopy trees. The study observed that only 80 parks have outstanding quality in terms of grass, colorful trees, and flowers (Fig.\n3\nd). Most of the high availability of grass and trees was observed in the middle of the study area (Fig.\n4\nf), and a low quality in outer side of the KMC (Fig.\n4\ng).\nAccessibility and connectivity\nThis criterion assesses the availability of transportation facilities to access the parks. The criteria weight of Accessibility and connectivity is 0.04, and the rank is 08 among 13 criteria. The study found that 35.84 per cent of UP had no transport facilities to access parks, while 20.92 percent had insufficient transport facilities. However, 43.25 percent of the park areas had sufficient transport facilities; conversely, 48.40% of the park areas had no transport connectivity (Table\n6\n). It is observed that most of the sufficient transport facilities are available in the central part, whereas the outer part of the KMC has no transport facility (Fig.\n3\ne).\nToilet and bathroom\nThis section highlights the availability of toilets and bathroom facilities in the urban parks. This reveals that the minimum influence with a criteria weight is 0.02, which highlights less attractiveness to the users. It is observed that only 9.02% of the area and 15.16 percent of the parks have sufficient toilets and bathrooms, occupying the central part of KMC. The study also found that 25.53 percent of park areas had insufficient availability, and 65.45 percent had no toilet and bathroom facilities (Table\n6\n). The available toilets and bathrooms were mostly concentrated in the mid-west of the KMC (Fig.\n3\nf).\nDrinking water\nThis part evaluates the availability of drinking water in parks. The criteria weight of drinking water is 0.02, and the rank is nine among all 13 criteria. It is observed from Table\n6\nand Fig.\n3\ng. that 88.83% of parks don’t have drinking water facility in the park, although this is necessary for UP users. Drinking water is necessary during or after the physical activity. In the KMC, only a few parks have sufficiently drunk water; therefore, a huge improvement is required to encourage visitors’ access and use of urban parks.\nPresence of dustbin\nThis segment assesses the availability of dustbins in the parks. The criteria weight is 0.02, and the rank is nine among the 13 criteria. This reveals a lower attraction to the users. It is observed from Table\n6\nthat only 57.47% of parks do not have a dustbin, 25.66% have insufficient and only 16.86% have sufficient dustbin. Most dustbins were available in the central part of the KMC (Fig.\n4\ni), and the outer areas of the parks did not have sufficient (Fig.\n3\nh). Dustbin plays a key role in maintaining attractiveness to ensure the cleanliness and beautification of the park.\nFitness equipment\nThis section evaluates the availability of jogging instruments in the parks. The AHP criteria weight is 0.10, and the rank is 4 based on the influence of all criteria (Table\n6\n), revealing higher attractiveness than others. Jogging instruments are unavailable in almost 88.74 per cent of the overall area and 95.35 per cent of the parks, followed by 9.60 per cent is occupied by insufficient jogging instruments with paid to use, while 1.66 per cent of the area is occupied by sufficient jogging instruments and no charge to use (Fig.\n3\ni and Fig.\n4\nj and k). Figure\n4\nl shows that some people perform free-hand exercises due to the unavailability of jogging instruments. The overall result is disappointing in this criterion.\nPer day average no. of users\nThis unit assesses the magnitude of park use, which emphasizes the level of utilization of parks by urban dwellers. The criteria weight was 0.04, and the rank was 8th based on the influence of the 13 criteria. About 63.16% of the parks record an intense use, which covers 42.57% of the KMC (Table\n6\n). The intensely used parks reflect better conditions from a utilization perspective. It is observed from the Fig.\n3\nj that regular with intense use parks are located in the central part of KMC.\nBeautification of aesthetic features\nThis part evaluates the presence of aesthetic features in parks and their level of beautification. As shown in Table\n6\n, 48.14% of the area and 35.51% of the park were occupied by regular beautification (Fig.\n4\nq). About 57.45 per cent of the total parks are being beautified on irregular basis (Fig.\n4\nn). Beautification was not available in 27.84% of cent spatial area (Fig.\n3\nk). Although the Fig.\n4\np represents a water body inside the park, which enhances the attractiveness of the user’s perspective. This finding is satisfactory in terms of beautification of aesthetic features.\nDegree of safety and maintenance\nThis section evaluates the degree of safety and maintenance of urban parks in terms of the presence of CCTV, fence boundaries, cleanliness, and security. The criteria weight is 0.09 and the rank is five based on the influence of all criteria (Table\n6\n). A high degree of safety and maintenance of urban parks is occupied by 26.75% of the city area, and 36.44 per cent of the parks are in this category (Fig.\n4\nm). The moderate level of safety and maintenance comprises 53.67 per cent area and 40.43 per cent park. The low level of safety and maintenance is occupied in 19.58 per cent area and 23.14 per cent park (Fig.\n3\nl and Fig.\n4\nn and o). It was observed that the area of parks was minimal in the case of the safety and maintenance of both low- and high-quality parks.\nShadow of trees\nThis section highlights the presence of shadow of trees in the parks. The criteria weight was 0.06, and the rank was seven based on the influence of all criteria. Table\n6\nshows that 17.13% of the area is occupied under the shadow of trees over a wider area, followed by 51.24 per the area occupied by the shadow of trees at negligible locations (Fig.\n3\nm). It is notable that there is an inverse relationship between the availability of shadows in the park and no. of parks having the shadow-making trees.\nZones of potential level of urban parks\nThe study has demarcated three potential zones i.e., low, moderate, and high potential zones (Table\n7\nand Fig.\n5\n). The data in Table\n7\nreveal that the low potential zone has occupied 45.05 sq.km areas of KMC, representing 24.35 per cent of KMC area and 33 per cent of the total parks of the city (Fig.\n5\nd). The moderate potential zone encompasses 129.5 sq.km, accounting for 70 per cent area, representing 62 per cent of total parks falling in this zone (Fig.\n5\nc). The high potential zone covers only 10.45 sq.km, representing 5.65 per cent area, and occupied 5 per cent (37) of the total number of parks (Fig.\n5\nb).\nTable 7 Zone of potential level of urban parks in KMC, 2021\nFull size table\nA high-potential UP ensures the presence of all types of infrastructure. Based on the analysis, high-potential parks are the most attractive having potential to maintain health of the city dwellers. Such parks form a potential zone for urban dweller. In this zone, the community residents get the opportunity to perform physical exercise in this park. Moderate-potential UP have relatively less attractive infrastructure than high-potential parks. It covers a significantly larger area and has the highest number of urban parks (464). Hypothetically, the residents of these regions do not have opportunities for all types of amenities and facilities. Therefore, people may be discouraged from engaging in physical activity. In contrast, low-potential parks offer few amenities and facilities to dwellers. Hence, people are less attracted to this park for PA purposes. Keeping in mind that low and moderate potential parks have a probability of enhancing attractiveness through the installation of infrastructure, therefore, the quality of UP may increase.\nThe park users have narrated a variety of reasons for choosing a park of high potential such as large spatial area, variety of attractiveness, proper safety & security, well management, and available various opportunities for multiple physical activities. Consequently, users feel comfortable to utilize the park and perceives benefits of physical activities. As per users’ perception, the three most popular parks within these zones are Victoria Memorial, Rabindra Sarovar, and Deshbondhu Park. These are lungs of the city. As per the opinion of the users such a high potential park automatically attract them to be in the nature and feels to stay as much time as possible. Spending few time at morning in the park feel happy entire the day. On the contrary, moderate and low-potential parks suffer from low attractiveness due to the inadequate infrastructure. The quality of parks reflects users’ behaviours. These parks provide limited opportunities for physical, psychological, and social interactions. Mainly the community residents of close location. Most of the users come from within 1000 m in moderate potential parks and from within 500 m in low potential parks. Infrastructure don’t attract them nor satisfy them for feeling pleasure. As per their opinion they less frequently visit the park and whenever visit they walk or free-hand exercise for few minutes with a range of 30–60 min.\nDiscussions\nThere are no thumb rules to represent the potential zones using the aforementioned 13 infrastructures. The primary purpose of the study was to analyze the quality of park infrastructures, determine their hierarchical rank, and potential levels. Finally, it aims to enhance the quality where is necessary to promote PA. The study demarcated three potential zones of urban parks in KMC, such as high, moderate, and low. The study found a disproportionate distribution of potential zones for urban parks. Furthermore, the relative importance of the 13 aforementioned infrastructures varies in identifying potential zones based on the pair-wise assessment. The evaluated infrastructures were mainly of two types: amenities and facilities, among them facilities were more important than amenities in the context of PA and human health. This study investigated each attribute to identify the actual status of the parks. The identified three zones of park and their locations may guide local people to participate in PA. In addition, the findings can guide urban planners and policymakers in identifying the area of deficiencies that need to be improved in the future. The KMC authority should take the initiative to enhance the quality of parks as per the findings of the study. This research contributes to the broader perspective of urban park planning and supports efforts to create more sustainable and livable urban environments. Therefore, the United Nations 2030 SDG goals will also be achieved by adopting the present study’s methods and findings.\nThe findings of the present work are similar to the study of Blacksburg, where found a higher level of green infrastructure encourages people to perceive better health and well-being (Kim & Miller,\n2019\n). Akpinar, (\n2016\n) found various significant features, such as sports grounds, basketball courts, running and walking foot tracks, swimming pools, light, shadow of trees, and drinking water are correlated with PA and improve human health. Another study identified key features, like size, design, water bodies, accessibility, connectivity, and maintenance as the determinant factors in achieving quality of life (Ahmad et al.,\n2016\n). Zhan et al., (\n2022\n) found that the overall self-reported health status of urban dwellers in Beijing is relatively higher than others who have access the high-quality urban parks. In addition, the past studies indicated that the quality of green spaces is linked to well-being, overall health and psychological health of the people (Francis et al.,\n2012\n). These studies also suggest that the health benefits depend on the quality of the green spaces (Paquet et al.,\n2013\n). Many studies have noted that attractive urban greenery promotes physical activity, encourages physical exercise, and provides multiple benefits (Zhai & Baran,\n2017\n). Therefore, the high potential attractive zones of urban parks are essential for encouraging people in PA (McCormack et al.,\n2010\n). In this context, the identified high potential parks are meaningful for greater PA and health improvement. In the study, parks with moderate to low quality zones having deficiencies in infrastructures, which discourage city dwellers to engage in PA.\nThe Global estimation of PA for health revealed that 27.5 per cent of adults (Guthold et al.,\n2018\n) and 81 per cent of adolescents (Guthold et al.,\n2020\n) do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity. Moreover, the World Health Organization recommends that every adult should engage in 150 – 300 min per week of moderate-to-intense physical activity and 75 – 150 min of vigorous physical activity to sustain physical fitness (WHO,\n2010\n). It is time to enhance the quality of attractiveness of the study parks infrastructure, especially in moderate and low potential zones to encourage people and meet the WHO recommendations.\nThe entire section discusses various infrastructures, and their significant role in promoting the PA and maintaining health. Several previous studies emphasized the larger park size is a significant attractive attribute for PA (Giles-Corti et al.,\n2005\n). Ekkel and de Vries (\n2017\n) stated that a minimum size (0.5 ha) of park is required to accommodate all types of amenities and facilities, and a larger size allows for the provision of multiple attributes. Therefore, the size of green spaces is a significant attribute and plays a crucial role in the utilization, attraction, and maintenance of physical health (McCormack et al.,\n2010\n). It is surprising to know that the study has only 100 parks of 0.5 ha in size, while remaining parks are less than the 0.5 ha, making them unsuitable for the provision of multiple attributes.\nOne study noted that the intensity levels of physical activities are high where multiple playgrounds and tennis courts are available (Zhai & Baran,\n2017\n). According to Ahmad and Matori (\n2016\n), well-maintained parks with multiple sports grounds provide opportunities to engage in PA. Another study found that close proximity to multifunction, that is, playgrounds, basketball courts, walking paths, and swimming areas was highly associated with PA (Kaczynski et al.,\n2008\n), though only 173 parks are having available quality of sports ground in KMC. Another significant attribute of the park is the foot track, which is also used for running, walking (Reed et al.,\n2008\n), and cycling. A study conducted in Australia revealed that engaging in physical activities, such as walking and running on a foot track, significantly contributes to reducing calories and maintaining healthy fitness (Wolf & Wohlfart,\n2014\n). Therefore, a close relationship observed between the foot track and physical activity of users. The present study result indicates quiet satisfaction regarding foot track distribution especially in high quality parks. Many previous studies have discussed various equipment are necessary for jogging and encouraging in PA (Hunter et al.,\n2015\n). Regular physical activity, like jogging in the UP, is positively associated with lower levels of obesity and has a positive influence on overall health through both formal and informal activities (Garcia et al.,\n2021\n). In the study, only 10 parks have sufficient and 15 parks have insufficient jogging instruments; however, 717 parks don’t have this facility. These findings are disappointing in encouraging people for PA. Along with these facilities, the aesthetic features of parks also play a significant role in attracting people. Another essential attractive element is the toilet and bathroom, which are used to maintain hygienic conditions to ensure universal access for women, children, the elderly, transgender people, and disabled people (Moreira et al.,\n2021\n). The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October 2014 intending to create 'Swachh Parks,' which provide detailed guidelines for maintaining a cleanliness, sanitized and hygienic environment within the parks (Ministry of Urban Development,\n2006\n). According to this report, sufficient toilets, bathrooms, and drinking water should be available within the parks. However, the present study observed that more than 65 per cent of the parks have no toilets or bathrooms. This 'Swachh Parks’ mission also emphasized color-segregated dust bins (Fig.\n4\nh). The degree of safety and maintenance of all types of infrastructure within a park is another important issue for parks that should be maintained properly (Ministry of Urban Development,\n2006\n). Safety is a significant self-secure attractive element of parks, where residents feel safe and secure from crime and sexual harassment (Cohen et al.,\n2010\n). Many studies have highlighted the importance of maintaining cleanliness and well-maintained parks (Stessens et al.,\n2020\n). However, other studies have suggested that adequate park management, sufficient funding, and good user behavior are essential for maintaining cleanliness (Stessens et al.,\n2020\n). One study identified that the accessibility and connectivity of parks is a key determinant of reaching the park and engaging in PA (McCormack et al.,\n2010\n). Another study revealed that walking was the predominant mode for residents in proximity to the UP (Su et al.,\n2019\n). Moreover, residents who access the green space by walking or cycling have a greater sense of happiness and satisfaction than those who use public transport or cars (Ta et al.,\n2021\n). Many studies have highlighted that higher accessibility means higher connectivity, and a cost-effective strategy for fostering the connection between inhabitants and attractive parks (Chen & Chang,\n2015\n). The discussion connects the present study of park infrastructure to other studies. The attributes of the study parks were strongly correlated with physical activity and maintaining healthy lives. Therefore, planners and policymakers should emphasize the improvement of attractive elements so that dwellers may attract parks for physical activity purposes.\nPlanning model of achieving potential attractiveness of urban parks for residents’ healthy city living\nThe main aim of the diagnostic planning model (Fig.\n6\n) is to enhance the potential attractiveness of urban parks, thereby promoting healthy living and well-being for individuals at all ages. This approach enables the enhancement of the infrastructure quality through renovating and installing parks elements as per requirements. As outlined in the introductory section about the various infrastructures, including park size, sports ground, foot track, abundance of trees, grass, color full plants, fitness equipment, beautification of aesthetic features, safety, and maintenance. These infrastructures fall under the categories of amenities, facilities, and others.\nFig. 6\nDiagnostic planning model for healthy city living\nFull size image\nTo ensure healthy lives and well-being, the authors prepared step-by-step procedures presented in the diagnostic model (Fig.\n6\n). Step – 1: The target of this planning model is to enhance the potential attractiveness of urban parks. Step – 2: Conduct a GPS survey to obtain geographical coordinates of parks. Step – 3: identify park’s infrastructures, and conduct a field survey to gather present conditions of the identified variables. Step – 4: Based on the field data, generate multiple thematic maps, and reclassify them for standardization using any standard GIS tools. Step – 5: Prepare separate sheet for weight and score determination using pair-wise comparison matrix based on present condition of the selected infrastructure, past literature, and expert opinion. Step – 6: Finally input the criteria weights using weighted overlay analysis of ArcGIS, ensure the sum of the weight must be equal to 1. After completed the entire procedure, three potential zones are identified as high, moderate, and low potential zone. To achieve the potential attractiveness, design and install the amenities, and facilities as per requirements. Ultimately, an attractive urban park developed for promoting physical activity for people of all ages ensuring safe, healthy lives and well-being.\nIn the study, among all parks of three potential zones, the most attractive and suggestive model park is Rabindra Sarovar based on the potential quality (Fig.\n4\na). This model park stands as one of the top most attractive according to both users’ opinion and data collected. It has a wide variety of amenities and facilities, which differs and make unique from others. Various key features have been identified and included here for helping the planners and policy makers. A wide variety of features such as park size of 77.88 ha (192.44 acres); sports ground available for children and common people; wide and well maintained foot tracks demarcated for walking, running, and cycling; available large blue space (one third of the total area); abundance of grass and shrubs, canopy trees with shadow, variety of colorful plants and flowers; diversity of wildlife population, accessibility and connectivity by transport like railway, metro, bus and auto stop; availability of vehicle parking lots, toilet and bathroom for ladies and gents separately, drinking water, dustbin, fitness equipment, fenced outer boundary, light and CCTV, signage board, along with open air theatre (Nazrul Mancha), and a stadium. All these features attract a large number of people of all age even from a longer distance. Most of the users visit the park on regular basis for various purposes i.e., physical exercise, psychological enchantment, recreational, social cohesion, and enjoying fresh air. As per the self-reported information, users mostly stay in the park for 45—180 min, some of the users access from 10 km. distance. Overall, users of Rabindra Sarovar are satisfied, feel pleasure and find themselves connected with the nature. Keeping in mind the impact of urban green spaces on the human health and well-being, parks in the KMC or in any cities may be planned considering Rabindra Sarovar as a model park.\nThis novel approach introduces new idea to the entire global community, particularly to urban planners and policymakers, who may adopt this idea in core urban areas. This model helps to enhance the attractiveness of UP by renovating existing parks infrastructures and installing new as per requirements in the old densed city like Kolkata where space is limited. This thought also be applicable where space is limited and the creation of new urban parks is not a viable option. Instead, the only practical solution is to enhance the quality of existing infrastructure by renovating various new amenities and facilities as per requirements.\nThis diagnostic model has potential to contribute to the achievement of the United Nations 2030, Sustainable Development Goals, especially goal 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and encouraging universal and safe access in green spaces (Advocates for International Development,\n2019\n). Many past studies found positive association of physical activity with proximity of urban parks, size, walking path, blue space, aesthetic view, light facility, parking zone, playground and overall quality (Hunter, et al.,\n2015\n). Physical activity also contributes to controlling different health-related risks, including premature death, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, overweight, psychological health, and well-being (Wang et al.,\n2019\n). Therefore, the potential attractiveness of urban parks plays a key role in promoting physical activity and maintaining physical health and well-being. Another study reported that the urban population is projected to increase from 53.9 per cent to 68.4 per cent by 2050 (Sugawara & Nikaido,\n2014\n). This projection implies new challenges for policymakers and planners in terms of managing this additional burden with proper management of the physical activity space. Hence, enhancing the attractiveness of urban parks is a crucial and sustainable solutions to accommodate future population growth. The idea of Ebenezer Howards ‘Garden City’ emerges as a new reaction to early industrialization, overpopulation (Olsson,\n2023\n). The central idea of planning model is to create a healthier environment within the urban parks for recreational purposes (Barton et al.,\n2018\n). The proposed planning model aims to achieve a healthy life, and healthier environment, for ensuring safe, and universal access for promoting physical activity for all at all ages.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the study found that 5.67 per cent area (10.58 sq. km) has high potential, 70 per cent (130.65 sq. km) has moderate potential, and the remaining 24.33 per cent area (45.40 sq. km) has low potential in KMC. Moreover, the relative ranks of these criteria are dissimilar, and facilities obtained a higher rank than amenities from the perspective of PA and human health. Previous studies have already proven that high-quality urban parks are significantly associated with higher levels of physical activity, human health, and well-being. The small area under the zones of high potential parks is intended to provide health benefits of urban green to the huge number of populations of an old metropolitan and populous city like Kolkata. Consequently, only a few people who reside near these parks can access and utilize them. It is surprising to look at the result, more than 464 (61.70%) and 251 (33.38%) urban parks fall under the categories of moderate and poor potential zones, respectively. A significant portion of the study exhibited relatively lower attractiveness, which is disappointing. Consequently, communities in these regions are less attracted to the UP. The results highlight that the park’s quality is unsatisfactory and fails to provide equal opportunities to the city dwellers. As a result, it does not fulfil the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for Universal Access. Hence, this study introduced a diagnostic planning model to enhance the attractiveness and quality, ensuring universal access for all policymakers and planners in any relevant area. Furthermore, the results suggest that planners and policymakers should consider variables and techniques to identify the potential zones of urban parks. Remember that the number of urban parks is just a number if they have no quality in terms of attractive amenities and facilities. This is why well-maintained and attractive amenities and facilities within parks are an urgent need for users.\nReferences\nAbebe, M. T., & Megento, T. L. (2017).

        "abstract": "Urban heat poses significant challenges to public health, as exposure to high temperatures is associated to heat stress, resulting in heat strain, sleep deprivation, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As the frequency of heat waves is increasing due to global warming, urban green spaces are often proposed as a nature-based solution to mitigate urban heat stress. This study investigated the impact of urban green space on perceived heat stress and sleep quality, using questionnaires and detailed land cover data. We surveyed 584 respondents during four heat and four control events in the summers of 2021 and 2022, assessing perceived heat stress, sleep quality, and mental health. Using structural equation models, this study analysed the influence of both tree cover and grass and shrub cover on perceived heat stress and sleep quality, while controlling for risk and vulnerability factors. The outcomes revealed that during heat events, enhanced tree cover was associated with reduced heat stress (B = -0.484, 95% CI [-0.693, -0.275], p = 0.001), while increased grass and shrub cover was associated with both reduced heat stress (B = -0.361 [-0.529, -0.193], p = 0.000) and improved sleep quality (B = -0. 241 [-0.399, -0.083], p = 0.003). Conversely, during control events, stress indicators were more strongly associated with individual vulnerability factors rather than surrounding green space. These results emphasize the importance of combining trees with lower vegetation in urban planning to mitigate heat-related stress and enhance sleep quality, thereby improving overall well-being during heat events.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Evidence suggests that access to urban green spaces (UGS) may encourage physical exercise and impact nutritional status and health. Nevertheless, the quality of UGS is an understudied area. Novel digital tools allow the analysis of urban environments. This study aims to explore the quality of UGS and its association with obesity in Córdoba, Argentina, using Google Street View (GSV) images. Study design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Methods: Lifestyle and sociodemographic data were collected in Córdoba, Argentina (n = 1322 adults) during 2020–2022. Anthropometric measurements were obtained. Buffers of 500m were established around dwellings to identify the presence of large-area UGS (≥1ha). The quality of 226 UGS was evaluated across specific dimensions using a multi-dimensional assessment tool adapted for remote monitoring through GSV. Two-level logistic regression models for obesity outcome (yes/no) were fitted using a random intercept to account for spatial variability. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated as measures of association. Results: Obesity was present in 25.9 % of participants. The UGS quality dimensions that showed an inverse association with obesity were safety (OR = 0.33; 95 % CI 0.32–0.82), potential usage (OR = 0.42; 95 % CI 0.21–0.81), surroundings (OR = 0.54; 95 % CI 0.31–0.93), access (OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.31–0.97), aesthetics (OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.34–0.87) and amenities (OR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.42–0.91). Proximity to UGS was not significantly associated with obesity. Conclusions: Rather than their proximity, the quality of the UGS might play a key role as a determinant of obesity. In urban areas, digital tools such as GSV are useful to explore these topics.",

These issues negatively impact the sustainability of cities and human well-being. Urban life also causes physical diseases and chronic stress, leading to diseases and cancer (Kim and Jin\n2018\n). Urbanized citizens expect a high quality of life, including good public health, an unpolluted environment, good food, safe drinking water, and recreational opportunities in green spaces (Botkin and Beveridge\n1997\n). A liveable city must have green spaces to provide healthier surroundings and various benefits to urban dwellers. Studies show that living close to urban green spaces (UGS) leads to increased happiness and health, as they provide an ideal setting for unwinding from daily stress (Addas,\n2023\n). Urban planning and design face the challenge of meeting residents’ expectations, and UGS such as parks, gardens, plazas, and trees are essential in addressing this (Reyes-Riveros et al.\n2021\n). These areas offer comfortable living environments (Takano et al.\n2002\n), physical and emotional benefits (Grahn and Stigsdotter\n2010\n), and a positive association with perceived general health (Maas et al.\n2006\n). Research conducted in metropolitan cities like New York (Sutton and Anderson\n2016\n), Singapore (Henderson\n2013\n), Tokyo (Kohsaka and Okumura\n2014\n) and Delhi (Paul and Nagendra\n2017\n) highlights the importance of green spaces in regulating urban health, supporting biodiversity, and enhancing livelihood opportunities.\nPublic health indicators primarily focus on physical health, including stress, obesity, respiratory diseases, mortality, and life expectancy. UGS is crucial for physical activity and urban health protection (Wolch et al.\n2014\n). Green spaces have positive effects on mortality, CVD morbidity, cardiometabolic factors, mental health, low birth weight, physical activity, sleep quality, and urban crime (Yang et al.\n2021\n). Since the 1990s, there has been a rapid increase in public health and green space studies, with interdisciplinary categories emerging (Zhang et al.\n2020\n). However, studies on social health are sparse, despite the growing prominence of environmental disciplines.\nUrban planners, park administrators, and public health professionals can use green spaces to promote health equity (Rigolon et al.\n2021\n), but access to these spaces is often stratified based on income, ethnic-racial characteristics, age, gender, and disability. Research has shown links between green space accessibility indicators and positive health effects, such as a significant relation between the percentage of green space within a one-kilometer and three-kilometer radius and a protective effect against anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts (Maas et al.\n2006\n). Understanding these factors is crucial for achieving equality in urban spaces (Nutsford et al.\n2013\n).\nPolicymakers and researchers are working to address access issues in UGS to ensure environmental justice, public health, and physical activity. Three parameters of UGS development policies have been identified: proximity, park acres, and quality (Rigolon\n2016\n). Proximity refers to a geographic unit’s distance to the nearest parks (Talen\n2010\n), while park acres refer to the number or size of green space and recreational facilities that increase the total size of the UGS (Sister et al.\n2010\n). Quality encompasses the qualities, features, and fitness for purpose that impact how the populace uses and interacts with the UGS (Knobel et al.\n2021\n), aiming to improve the quality of UGS through improved service and maintenance levels (Rutt and Gulsrud\n2016\n).\nUGS management and planning in high-density urban areas require accurate information about these areas. Visitor perceptions are a common method used to measure UGS quality, which is crucial for effective management (Baur et al.\n2016\n). However, visitor perception of surrounding UGS is subjective and varies from person to person (Langemeyer et al.\n2015\n), influenced by factors like personality, location, socio-economic profile, scene composition, and complexity (Chen et al.\n2009\n). As a result, understanding the advantages and objective qualities of UGS is difficult, making it difficult to interpret perceptual data on UGS (Kothencz and Blaschke\n2017\n).\nAlthough a lot of studies have focused on many issues related to visitor perceptions (Basu and Nagendra\n2021\n; Chen et al.\n2009\n; Font et al.\n2021\n; Kothencz and Blaschke,\n2017\n; Paul and Nagendra,\n2017\n; Rupprecht et al.\n2015\n) of UGS, studies on visitor complaints are limited (Delshammar et al.\n2015\n). The handling of customer and visitor complaints can significantly impact satisfaction and loyalty levels, indicating the importance of evaluating organizational performance (Calin\n2012\n). Organizations can address complaints effectively by finding effective solutions and taking corrective action if necessary. Management should also prepare for positive feedback to boost visitor numbers (Fang et al.\n2016\n). Satisfaction can transform dissatisfied customers into satisfied and loyal ones, leading to revisiting, highlighting superior features, positive word-of-mouth, recommendations, and longer stays, particularly in UGS (Çevik\n2020\n). A satisfied park visitor is thought to increase the frequency of UGS visits and the time spent in these areas. In this context, the increase in the use of UGS in communities can make positive contributions to both individual and public health.\nDespite being the most densely populated metropolis in Türkiye, Istanbul has far less green space per person (7.6 m2) (İBBF\n2019\n) than the minimum level (9 m2) that the World Health Organization (\n2012\n) recommends for healthy cities. Under these circumstances, it is even more crucial to conduct research for a more effective and efficient use of the city’s green spaces. As a result, it will be possible to help design public policies that will increase the health and well-being of UGS visitors by revealing the complaints of UGS visitors about these areas. Therefore, aiming to explore the visitors’ complaints about the UGS in Istanbul, the research question of this study is “Which aspects of the nation gardens in Istanbul do visitors complain about?”\nMethodology\nResearch context and data collection\nAccording to the Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change (\n2022\n), Istanbul has 12 completed nation gardens projects, which aim to increase green space and meet recreational demands. Using Google Maps reviews as the primary source of data, the study focused on analyzing visitor complaints regarding these 12 nation gardens. Compared to surveys and interviews, online reviews offer a novel and efficient method for investigating visitors’ perspectives (Ye et al.\n2014\n). Further, research shows that 63.6% of internet users are likely to check Google Reviews before deciding to visit a particular destination, which makes Google the leading review site (Review Tracker\n2022\n). This implies that Google Maps user reviews can be a valuable data source to explore visitors’ perceptions of the nation gardens.\nGoogle Maps allows users to control who sees their public contributions, including reviews, photos, and ratings, which are automatically found on their profile and can be restricted by updating profile settings (Google Maps\n2024a\n). It also enables users to view and edit their public profile, which includes the ability to change their Google name, profile photo, add a short bio, manage account settings and privacy controls, find past contributions and posts, and review topic stats (Google Maps\n2024b\n). In adherence to Google Maps’ privacy policy and terms of service, the publicly available data was utilized for this study. Nevertheless, user names and locations were not revealed, prioritizing ethical considerations, including user privacy and anonymity.\nData screening and selection criteria\nA comprehensive dataset comprising 38,965 Google Maps user reviews was initially screened to identify visitor complaints about the 12 nation gardens in Istanbul. Then, to ensure the relevance and precision of the reviews, the following exclusion criteria were implemented:\n(1) Reviews containing questions only (e.g.,\n“What time does it close?”\n);\n(2) Positive reviews (e.g.,\n“One of the most beautiful scenery in Istanbul!”\n);\n(3) Neutral reviews (e.g.,\n“Barbecues and samovars are prohibited.”\n);\n(4) Non-specific visitor complaints; (e.g.,\n“I gave one star because I wanted to.”\n);\n(5) Rating-only reviews.\nReviews with five-star ratings were not excluded a priori, as some discrepancies between certain reviews and corresponding ratings were noticed. For instance, a visitor, despite giving a five-star rating, stated\n“Nice service but no maintenance! Most playground equipment is broken and not repaired. There is a security but it’s not active.”\nSimilarly, another visitor giving a five-star rating stated\n“I gave it five stars to stand out, but this place is worthless.”\nGiven such discrepancies, all visitor reviews with complaints ranging from a one-star rating to a five-star rating were included in the analysis.\nThematic analysis process\nAccording to the predetermined “criteria for inclusion/exclusion of online comments,” three researchers identified the comments to be included in the analysis, and all identified comments were coded separately by the three researchers involved in the study in two stages (Saldaña\n2015\n). In the primary coding, the data set was allowed to generate codes, while in the secondary coding, the codes obtained from the first coding were structured. This was followed by steps aimed at identifying patterns, connections, and common themes among the final codes. To do this, literature on UGS/park recreation was also reviewed. The full consensus among all researchers ensured that the themes emerging from each researcher’s coding took their final form (Miles et al.\n2019\n).\nFollowing the data screening, the final dataset comprised 4143 reviews specifically addressing complaints, forming the basis for the subsequent thematic analysis of visitor complaints. Each review was transferred to Excel, and 4143 were gathered in an Excel spreadsheet, which was then imported into MAXQDA software. Data analysis was performed using Braun and Clarke’s (\n2006\n) six-phased thematic analysis approach (Braun and Clarke\n2006\n). First, users’ reviews were actively read to become familiar with the data, thereby identifying possible meanings and patterns in the codes. Second, by organizing the data into meaningful groups, initial codes were generated. Third, by gathering different codes with shared meanings, whether they could be grouped under a common theme was identified. Thus, a set of candidate themes was constructed. Fourth, considering both coded data extracts and the entire data set, the candidate themes were reviewed and refined. Fifth, each theme was defined and named. In this phase, each theme was handled in relation to the other themes to ensure that there was not too much overlap between the themes. Also, to give the reader an immediate idea of what the theme was about, it was taken into account that the name of the theme was short and concise. Last, selected vivid and compelling extracts that captured the essence of the stories about the data were reported. Further, to support the qualitative findings about the prevalence of the themes in the data, the percentages and frequencies of the codes under each theme were calculated.\nResults\nIn total, 6135 coded data were extracted from the 4143 visitor complaints. 91 codes were then generated and gathered under five themes: outdoor areas/physical characteristics (28.4%), facilities (27.5%), visitors’ interactions (23.3%), accessibility/entrance management (11.9%), and restrictions and security implications (8.9%) (see Figs.\n1\nand\n2\n). The generated codes and themes were organized under the code system in MAXQDA and then visualized as shown in Fig.\n3\n.\nFig. 1\nDistributions of visitor complaints.\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nCode clouds.\nFull size image\nFig. 3\nVisitor Complaints.\nFull size image\nOutdoor areas/physical characteristics\nOutdoor areas/physical characteristics were the most frequently referenced theme by visitors. 17 codes were generated for this theme. Visitors’ primary complaints in this theme related to a lack of shade trees, a lack of outdoor benches, and poorly maintained outdoor areas. Visitors expressed their complaints as follows:\n“I don’t recommend going before sunset. It’s very difficult to find tree shade.”\n“Seating areas, such as benches, are insufficient. Many families including us had to sit on the ground.”\n“The area was so dirty and neglected that I was very surprised, it was the first time I saw a nation garden so bad… It was full of garbage in the forest areas.”\nOther common complaints included sloping ground that impeded movement and activities, as well as proximity to contaminated water sources which raised health concerns. Visitors also complained about the lack of shaded seating areas to protect them from sunlight and the lack of green spaces that spoil the natural atmosphere. Insufficient cleaning services in outdoor areas contributed to a less pleasant visiting experience. Visitors further mentioned that surrounding buildings, narrow outdoor areas, and the proximity to busy highways reduce the attractiveness of the nation gardens. Visitors additionally reported dissatisfaction with the lack of recreational event opportunities. Concerns such as inadequate direction signs, poor ground conditions, inadequate accessibility for people with mobility difficulties, and irregular lawn watering schedules were stated by the visitors. Windy weather conditions, inadequate landscape design, and the lack of hand-washing sinks all contributed to visitor unpleasantness. In addition, inconveniently located seats and a lack of litter bins affected the usability of the gardens.\nFacilities\nThe second theme was facilities. 33 codes were generated for this theme. Then, the theme was divided into three sub-themes: general facilities (16 codes), children’s playgrounds (8 codes), and physical activity and sports (9 codes). The primary complaints in general facilities were a lack of food and beverage facilities, poor toilet hygiene, and a lack of toilets. For this sub-theme, examples of the statements most frequently complained about by visitors are given below:\n“It doesn’t even have a place to get water. At least there could have been a vending machine or something.”\n“It is a very beautiful place but the toilets are in a terrible condition, they need to be taken care of. Although it is paid, it is not hygienic.”\n“There is a WC problem, it’s not enough. Additional public toilets required.”\nIn addition, many of the visitors found the prices for products and services excessive. Besides, some visitors expressed their concerns about the absence and poor hygiene of prayer rooms around, since they could not fulfill their religious duties. Visitors also mentioned being disappointed by the absence of designated barbecue areas and the unavailability of some facilities. Limited food options and poor service quality in food and beverage facilities were the other issues that contributed to dissatisfaction. The working hours and locations of the facilities were also questioned by the visitors. Charging entry fees for essential services such as toilets was considered inappropriate. Inadequate and impolite personnel at the facilities further worsened the overall experience. The absence of baby care rooms was also noted as a drawback by families visiting the gardens.\nInsufficient playgrounds, a lack of equipment variety, and poorly maintained equipment were the most observed complaints in the playgrounds sub-theme. Poorly located playgrounds, unsafe equipment, dysfunctional flooring, and uncleanliness made nation gardens less appealing to families with children. Besides, although uncommon, several adults monopolized children’s equipment by using the playgrounds, which caused safety concerns and discomfort both for children and parents. Some examples of the most frequently addressed complaints by visitors are given below:\n“There is a tiny playground in the big area, there could be more. Children are waiting in line to play.”\n“The playground for children is insufficient. It has a huge area but there are two swings. More different equipment could have been put, instead of ordinary swings and slides…”\n“The swings are about to break and must be repaired before an accident occurs.”\nThe most commonly reported complaints in the physical activities and sports sub-theme were a lack of a sufficient number of sports fields, poor condition of running/cycling paths, and a lack of rental bikes. Lack of running/cycling paths, poorly maintained sports fields, lack of sports equipment, user-unfriendly bike rental systems, poorly maintained rental bikes, and unsafe sports fields were also expressed by visitors as contributors to dissatisfaction by limiting their opportunities for physical activity and sports. Some examples of the most frequently reported complaints by visitors for this sub-theme are as follows:\n“…there is a volleyball net in the middle of the basketball court and when there are people who want to play both basketball and volleyball, the atmosphere gets a little too complicated.”\n“The running and walking path should be a tartan track. This is the first time I have seen a gravel running track. It definitely needs to be fixed.”\n“…but I have a small request, the number of bicycles is very small considering the area. It would be better if there were a little more.”\nVisitors’ interactions\nThe third theme was visitors’ interactions. Six codes were generated for this theme. Complaints from the visitors were mostly about overcrowding, too many foreign visitors, and visitors’ littering. Some examples of the visitor reviews are given below:\n“The only downside is that it is extremely crowded, you have to wait in line for everything. It is possible to wait for half an hour in the cafeteria or WC queue. My advice, especially on weekends and public holidays, do not come.”\n“I was so upset that I was wandering around :(as if I was in another country). There were very few Turks. It was like a city of Arabia or Syria. I don’t judge anyone, but in this case, it’s not normal at all, we became foreigners in our own country.”\n“There are litter bins everywhere, but unfortunately, it is too beautiful park for local and foreign visitors who throw the sunflower seed shells they eat on the grass and leave food on the rocks…”\nAdditionally, many visitors expressed their discomfort with the overwhelming smell of barbecue and samovar smoke. Moreover, the visibility of people who appeared threatening or frightening elevated visitors’ concerns and impaired their sense of personal safety. As well, visitors became irritated when they encountered others ignoring park rules, such as jumping across pedestrian or bicycle paths or behaving inappropriately in designated seating areas. Vandalism, disruptive noise from other visitors, intimacy between couples, and socio-cultural heterogeneity in shared spaces contributed to interpersonal conflicts. Besides, the prevalence of cigarette and hookah smoke, along with the presence of drinkers, exacerbated discomfort and health concerns among non-smoking visitors. Lastly, the presence of fast cyclists on the pedestrian paths drew complaints from visitors.\nAccessibility/Entrance management\nThe fourth theme was entrance management. Six codes were generated for this theme. Under this theme, the visitors mainly mentioned the busy parking area, parking fees, lack of entrance gates, and visiting hours. Visitors voiced their concerns about accessibility and entrance management in the following statements:\n“It is very nice and clean but the parking lot is very small, especially on weekends. Last weekend we made preparations for a picnic, we couldn’t find a place for the car, and we turned back.”\n“The parking lot has become paid. The nation garden should be used for the benefit of the public. I think twice about going because of the parking fee.”\n“It’s ridiculous that it closes at 10\npm, what’s 10\npm on a summer day? Just when it’s getting cooler, you hear the announcement that the park will close.”\nBesides, visitors expressed their frustration with the limited public transportation options to reach the nation gardens. Since the gardens were mostly located far from the city center, they were also difficult to reach on foot. Thus, visitors had few alternatives to reach the gardens other than by automobile or motorcycle. Visitors traveling by automobile or motorcycle were also dissatisfied with the long travel time caused by frequent traffic jams along the route. One of the complaints voiced by visitors was that the nation gardens were closed to visitors on Mondays. They stated that they would prefer the gardens to be accessible to visitors every day of the week.\nRestrictions and security implications\nThe last theme was restrictions and security implications. The main points of the 14 codes generated under this theme were no lightning at night, not being allowed to barbecue/use a samovar, and inadequate security measures. Some examples of the main visitor complaints are as follows:\n“When it gets dark, the lights don’t turn on and it gets pitch dark. I think the authorities should find a solution to this.”\n“Barbecue samovar is forbidden, people come here to picnic, this is not a playground.”\n“It has large and useful areas, but security is low. It needs to be more secure. The camera system should be more intense.”\nVisitors further criticized the way of implementing security measures, loud public announcements, a lack of security personnel, and their indifferent and rude behaviors. Visitor complaints involving pedestrianization in nation gardens differed. Some visitors complained that nation gardens were not pedestrian-friendly, while those who visited there by car or motorcycle complained about the motorized vehicle restrictions. Some of the nation gardens do not allow visitors to sit on the grass, which is deemed ridiculous and pointless by several visitors. The presence of stray dogs, pests, and mosquitoes in the area also affected the visitors’ satisfaction adversely.\nDiscussions\nVisitor satisfaction is directly linked to the positive or negative experience, as it relates to meeting needs or motives (Tian-Cole and Cromption\n2003\n). Negative experiences often lead to complaints (Bitner et al.\n1994\n). The study revealed that more than three-quarters of visitor complaints about urban green areas examined were due to outdoor areas/physical characteristics, facilities and visitor interactions. The primary complaint of the visitors of the nation garden is related to outdoor areas/physical characteristics. In past studies, it is seen that factors such as enjoying/being in nature (Andriotis\n2011\n; Sreetheran,\n2017\n), getting fresh air (Gashu et al.\n2020\n; Sreetheran\n2017\n), resting and viewing the scenery (Chiesura\n2004\n) come at the beginning of the motivations of UGS visitors to visit these areas. In addition, citizens living in metropolitan areas prefer high levels of greenery, more seats and large UGS (Lo and Jim\n2012\n). The study highlights a deficiency in Istanbul’s gardens, indicating a lack of natural and physical features that align with the fundamental motivations for visiting green spaces. Consequently, this inadequacy may have heightened the demand for green areas and raised expectations among urban residents. Addressing common complaints such as insufficient tree shade and outdoor seating could significantly enhance the capacity of these spaces to fulfill visitor expectations. Managers could address these concerns by taking into account such feedback and implementing necessary improvements.\nFacilities are a significant complaint subject, with complaints categorized into general facilities, children’s playgrounds, and physical activity and sports opportunities. The primary issue is the lack of food and beverage facilities, as well as inadequate toilet facilities and lack of maintenance. Considering that the success of a park depends on both supply and maintenance (Jibril and Elfartas\n2018\n) and that basic park amenities are necessary for visitors of all age groups (McCormack et al.\n2010\n), park planning and administration must ensure proper facility maintenance and provide amenities that meet visitor needs to improve the quality of life for urban dwellers. Another complaint theme identified in the study is related to playgrounds. Prior studies on UGS usage have revealed that taking kids outside is one of the main motivations for visiting (Irvine et al.\n2013\n). Many families go to playgrounds to be with their children or to keep their children physically active (Refshauge et al.\n2012\n). And these facilities offer chances for socializing, playing, and carrying out physical fitness activities (Qazi\n2011\n). Therefore, the presence and maintenance of playgrounds is crucial, especially for urban dwellers with children. The current study also found that visitors complained about lack of physical activity and sports opportunities. UGS is an important component in promoting physical activity, and these areas are one of the important quality indicators of these areas (Zhang et al.\n2022\n). Many studies show a strong relationship between UGS and physical activity. In addition to having specially designed facilities for sports, exercise and other strenuous activities, it also offers areas where people can run or walk (Cohen et al.\n2007\n), and is one of the most important motivational factors for city residents to use parks (Bedimo-Rung et al.\n2005\n). UGS visitors could be influenced by the design and condition of the facilities (Bedimo-Rung et al.\n2005\n). If visitors are not satisfied, the UGS may go underutilized or be abandoned (Ali and Nawawi\n2006\n). For this reason, the facilities offered by UGS should favor the people’s needs, demands, and preferences.\nThe “visitor interactions” was identified as an important complaint, highlighting the potential problems arising from encounters with crowds. Crowding research highlights its significant social impact on outdoor recreation and reveals that high human density can cause visitor stress in UGS (Arnberger and Eder\n2015\n). UGS visitors are motivated by the experience of silence and peace (Shan\n2014\n), and often avoid crowds to achieve this state of tranquility (Wan and Shen,\n2015\n). The research confirms the common issue of crowding in densely populated cities such as Istanbul, highlighting the need for effective solutions to address this issue. Another theme identified within the scope of visitor interactions was that there were too many foreign visitors in the areas. UGS and city parks are crucial for social integration, providing temporary leisure spaces for various ethnic groups, and fostering a sense of belonging (Stodolska et al.\n2017\n) and attachment (Neal et al.\n2015\n). However, encounters between different ethnic groups in these areas can lead to negative consequences. Dines et al. (\n2006\n) noted conflicts in neighborhood public spaces, particularly neighborhood parks, due to racial tension (Dines et al.\n2006\n). Madanipour (\n2010\n) highlighted problematic incidents involving minorities in Rotterdam, Netherlands, due to the city’s heavy use of public spaces (Madanipour\n2010\n). Istanbul, Türkiye’s largest city, is home to the highest number of immigrants, causing negative attitudes among locals (Doğan et al.\n2020\n). This attitude is believed to be reflected in park areas and affects study results. In this context, park managers should tailor park design and event programing to embrace diverse communities and encourage positive interactions.\nIn the current study, another complaint issue identified is related to accessibility and entrance management. In particular, inequalities in the accessibility and distribution of parks and green spaces are an issue that is gaining increasing attention. Some of the main areas of research have focused on identifying access levels and areas that lack accessibility (Wei\n2017\n). This situation is also shown as one of the important constraints on individuals’ use of parks and green areas (Rushing et al.\n2019\n). In this context, it is recommended that urban park planners seek strategies to increase the accessibility of urban parks to ensure that socio-cultural benefits are shared equitably (Talal and Santelmann\n2021\n). The last complaint theme identified in this current study is restrictions and security implications. Along with its many advantages, UGS has several disadvantages that are frequently disregarded (Maruthaveeran and van den Bosch\n2014\n). Numerous empirical investigations have indicated a direct correlation between decreased utilization of UGS and fear of crime. However, fear of park use due to perceived safety has been reported, especially among children and women (McCormick and Holland\n2015\n). Apart from this, the literature also investigates the physical characteristics such as landscape design, vegetation density, maintenance, physical incivility, amount of light, way-finding and legibility, and visibility of UGSs that may affect perceived safety (Mahrous et al.\n2018\n).\nThis exploratory study contributes to the extensive literature by determining the complaints of visitors of Istanbul nation gardens in these areas. In this study, five complaint themes were identified for these areas, and it was reported that three of these themes named outdoor areas/physical characteristics, facilities and visitor interactions constituted three-quarters of the complaints made. Apart from these themes, other factors such as accessibility and entrance management and the limitations and security implications of nation gardens appear to be factors that generate fewer complaints. Examining the codes that comprise these themes demonstrates that complaints regarding the crowd are prominent. In this context, especially in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul, where the amount of green space is limited, park planners can integrate the suggestions, expectations and needs of visitors in improving existing parks and designing new ones. The investigation of park visitors’ complaints could add a new social- and people-oriented dimension to refine design and management. In this way, by ensuring more effective use of UGS, individual and social benefits, such as health outcomes obtained from these areas, can be maximised.\nImplications\nThe analysis of visitor grievances and the ensuing application of remedies are critical to improving UGS. The study’s conclusions have several useful ramifications that apply to this situation. These suggestions provide concrete actions to resolve visitor issues and improve UGS quality. The development and administration of parks and green spaces may improve visitor satisfaction and the general quality of life in cities by using such doable measures.\nSeveral management implications have been suggested to improve UGS in light of the study’s findings. In order to enhance the physical characteristics and operational efficiency of outdoor areas, it is advised to increase the selection of sitting opportunities, such as picnic tables and benches, and to strategically place these facilities around the park. Expanding the number of trees in sitting and rest spaces can improve comfort on bright days by providing the shade that is needed. A nice and friendly atmosphere may also be maintained by enhancing maintenance and repair services and increasing the frequency of cleaning and waste collection.\nFurther recommendations focus on enhancing the overall visitor experience and accessibility. Ensuring the availability of clean, accessible toilets and establishing more facilities that offer diverse food and beverage options are critical for visitor satisfaction. Designing dedicated areas for children’s play and sports activities can cater to a broader audience and enhance recreational opportunities. Managing the number of visitors, particularly during peak times like weekends and holidays, will help prevent overcrowding. Additionally, for visitor management, practices can be implemented to help different ethnic groups communicate and understand each other by planning activities that will encourage cultural diversity and participation. Security can be improved by enhancing lighting, installing security cameras, and increasing patrols, which will also create a safer environment for activities such as barbecuing and picnicking. Extending the working hours of services provided at UGSs and increasing public transportation options would make these spaces more accessible and user-friendly.\nTo ensure sustainability in UGSs, it is imperative to establish a framework that incorporates residents into the system, in addition to implementing practical applications informed by research findings. In the current study by Nguyen and Jones (\n2022\n), it is suggested that the development of natural areas can be contributed by developing an eco-surplus culture among residents. This concept is a set of environmentally friendly attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviors shared by a group of people, aimed at reducing negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and protecting and restoring nature. Encouraging the cultivation of an eco-surplus culture has the potential to enhance city residents’ awareness and appreciation of biodiversity, conservation endeavors, and initiatives aimed at addressing environmental challenges within UGSs. This approach also facilitates UGSs’ role in educating visitors about environmental issues and potential solutions. Thus, urban residents have the opportunity to engage actively in environmental conservation and sustainability endeavors through such initiatives. Given this information, a comprehensive approach can be developed to protect and enhance green spaces in densely populated areas like Istanbul, where green space is limited. This approach may include nature education workshops, awareness programs, volunteer opportunities for community-based nature conservation efforts, organization of ecologically oriented recreational activities integrated with nature, and the implementation of environmentally sustainable green space designs. The increasing efforts by authorities to encourage the utilization of these areas will also enhance city residents’ contact with nature. Considering that contact with nature is deemed an effective means for constructing eco-surplus culture (Vuong and Nguyen\n2023\n), this situation can generate a cycle by fostering interaction. In this context, UGSs are believed to play a key role in the formation of eco-surplus culture within societies.\nBeyond the traditional establishment of environmental conservation culture, reshaping cultural values as proposed by Vuong (\n2021\n) to incorporate the value of environmental conservation may lead to the creation of an eleventh cultural value, fostering a long-term understanding of environmental preservation. Furthermore, this newly created cultural value introduces a novel concept of profitability measured by the degree of benefits derived from nature restoration and enhancement of sustainability conditions. In his study advocating for sustainable practices within business sectors, Vuong (\n2021\n) defines profitability as the sum of net environmental value and net monetary profit. This novel perspective on profitability could benefit from the adoption of a model in the management of urban green spaces in Istanbul, one that integrates environmental and social values into operational frameworks.\nFor instance, complaints regarding inadequate facilities and physical attributes of green spaces (such as lack of maintenance or insufficient natural features) could be addressed through the implementation of a semiconductor principle model. This would entail assessing the net environmental value (NEV), which includes contributions such as enhancing public health, reducing urban heat, and increasing social well-being, thereby addressing these spaces’ roles.\nUrban planners can ensure that investments in UGSs, whether through increased funding or public support, align with both the tangible and intangible benefits they provide by capitalizing on these values. Such an approach would not only address immediate visitor complaints but also promote a broader cultural shift towards recognizing and enhancing the true value of green spaces in urban environments.\nMoreover, the integration of eco-surplus culture into UGS management could lead to more sustainable urban environments prioritizing public health and well-being. This cultural shift may encompass community engagement programs that educate and involve the public in green space improvements, thus creating a feedback loop where public interaction directly influences the continuous improvement and sustainability of these areas.\nLimitations and future research\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, the reliance on Google Maps visitor reviews introduces inherent biases, in that the sample is confined to visitors who actively use the platform. This selection bias excludes visitors who may be less technologically inclined or prefer alternative navigation tools, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the broader population. Future research could conduct face-to-face surveys or interview techniques to explore visitor complaints from individuals who are less familiar with technology. Alternative navigation platforms or online review platforms could also be used as data sources to improve the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the study is constrained by its limited geographical scope, as it focuses on nation gardens in Istanbul, an over-urbanized city. Therefore, the findings may not comprehensively represent the experiences and complaints of nation garden visitors in less urbanized cities. Future studies could focus on visitor complaints regarding urban green spaces in less urbanized cities.\nData availability\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nReferences\nAddas A (2023) The importance of urban green spaces in the development of smart cities.

The risk of encountering infected ticks is omnipresent during recreational activities in urban green spaces, highlighting the need for public health campaigns to reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases.\nPeer Review reports\nBackground\nGreen spaces in urban environments provide health benefits to residents and conserve biodiversity and ecosystem functions [\n1\n]. However, urban green spaces can also increase the risk for contact between humans and animal-associated pathogens [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Viable tick populations are increasing in many urban green spaces, and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in urban settings are even comparable to similar habitats in rural areas [\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n]. This not only presents a potential public health challenge but can also undermine the public health gain from urban green spaces [\n7\n].\nUrban green spaces include green infrastructures in and around cities used for recreational activities [\n8\n]. Urban green spaces can provide relief from the pressure of living in a city and are places where residents may be in touch with the natural cycle of the seasons and of wildlife [\n9\n]. Urban forests, parks, and open grasslands often form a network of dispersal corridors for wildlife migration [\n10\n,\n11\n]. Wild ungulates can serve as feeding hosts for ticks bringing them close to urban areas, and small vertebrates such as rodents are important tick-borne pathogen reservoirs [\n12\n]. From a public health perspective, risks regarding tick-borne diseases should be studied in urban green spaces, where contact between infected ticks and humans may be frequent, due to the high human activity [\n13\n]. Still, the rates of contact with infected ticks in urban green spaces used for recreation remains inadequately quantified [\n14\n,\n15\n].\nIn Europe, the geographical distribution of two medically important tick species,\nIxodes ricinus\nand\nI. persulcatus,\nhave expanded significantly during the last few decades [\n16\n,\n17\n]\n.\nLyme Borreliosis (LB), the most frequently reported tick-borne disease, is caused by spirochetes from the\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nsensu lato (s.l.) complex [\n18\n]. These spirochetes are susceptible to several classes of antibiotics, and treatment of patients in an early stage of the disease usually results in complete recovery [\n19\n]. Still, severe outcome and long-term symptoms occur, burdening patients and healthcare systems. To mitigate disease burden, vaccines against LB are in development [\n20\n].\nB. miyamotoi\n, which is clustered in the relapsing fever\nBorrelia\ngroup, is considered an emerging tick-borne disease [\n21\n].\nAnaplasma phagocytophilum,\nthe causative agent of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA), a febrile disease in humans, is the most widespread tick-borne disease in animals in the Northern Hemisphere causing significant economic losses [\n22\n]. In many European countries the bacterial tick-borne diseases are not notifiable, thus, it is difficult to determine the actual burden of these diseases [\n23\n].\nTick-borne disease risk has often been assessed by estimations of infected ticks in a certain area [\n24\n,\n25\n]. However, these studies only measure the acarological risk and do not consider the complexity of human behavior and movement patterns, which is required for human-tick contact to occur [\n26\n]. In addition, the popularity of outdoor recreational activities among Europeans has resulted in an increased risk of tick-borne diseases [\n27\n]. Quantifying visits to green spaces by residents, and to understand the factors influencing their visits, remains a daunting task [\n28\n]. Therefore, a fundamental challenge in understanding the public health risk of tick-borne diseases, is the high heterogeneity in visitor use intensity and behavior in urban green spaces [\n29\n].\nProper risk assessment for tick-borne diseases includes a combination of factors related to the identification of the tick hazard and the characterization of human exposure [\n30\n]. The hazard is the number of infected ticks in the environment determined by the habitat conditions allowing ticks, hosts, and pathogens to complete their life cycles and to overlap [\n31\n]. Exposure is the spatial overlap between the hazard and humans, specifically the degree to which individuals get into contact with tick-infected areas [\n32\n]. The absence of a human vaccine for bacterial tick-borne pathogens has led to a focus on individual preventative measures to reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases [\n33\n]. Common public health recommendations include avoiding tick habitats, regular tick checks when walking in tick endemic areas, and wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and tucking the pants into the socks [\n34\n]. Although these methods may be effective for preventing tick bites, the adoption of these behaviors varies [\n35\n,\n36\n,\n37\n,\n38\n,\n39\n]. To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of the first to simultaneously evaluate both tick hazards and visitor use intensity and behaviors to assess the risk of tick-borne diseases.\nThe aim of this study is to assess the public health risk of tick-borne diseases in an urban green space used for recreation. By using data on hazard and exposure, we evaluated how the risk of tick-borne diseases is affected by habitat characteristics, human usage, and individual behaviors. To assess the public health risk, data on hazard and exposure were combined into an index estimating the potential risk of tick-borne diseases. Our results can provide a basis for optimizing tick bite prevention and outreach measures to protect public health in urban green spaces.\nMethods\nField sites\nThe Nacka nature reserve (Fig.\n1\n) is located at the edge of the metropolitan area of Stockholm. It is one of Sweden’s most visited greenspace with more than 1,5 million visitors per year. The reserve is one of Stockholm’s largest, with approximately 730 hectares of forests, seminatural grasslands and lakes with several popular entry points, all close to the central parts of Stockholm. Forests and seminatural grasslands were previously used as pastures, fields, and meadows and the reserve is now a remnant of the old agricultural landscape. Several of the formerly open areas in the reserve are still kept open by mowing. During the last 70 years, this green space has mainly been used for recreational activities and offers opportunities for several outdoor activities such as walking, trail running, swimming, orienteering, biking, golf and picknick. The popular 1000 km long Sörmlands hiking trail starts at one of the entry points and runs through the southern part of the nature reserve.\nFig. 1\nLocation of the study area in Sweden (\na\n) and Stockholm (\nb\n), and positions of the 6 sampling sites in Nacka nature reserve (\nc\n)\nFull size image\nPublic health risk assessment design\nTo assess the public health risk of tick-borne diseases in urban greenspaces, we used a mixed model approach identifying both the tick hazard, and the human exposure to ticks and tick-borne pathogens. To keep track of the daily visitors to the nature reserve, the municipality of Stockholm has placed six public count boxes at the entry points: Sickla, Björkhagen, Kärrtorp, Bagarmissen, Klisätra and Hellas recreations center (Fig.\n1\n). The location of these public count boxes served as starting points for our data collection. Most entry points are easily reached, located close to the Stockholm subway system and public buses. Descriptions of all entry point is provided in Additional file\n1\n.\nTo collect hazard data, we sampled ticks at the six entry points to establish tick densities and prevalence of bacterial pathogens. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is also a public health problem in this area. However, the low prevalence of TBE-virus in ticks [\n40\n], makes TBEV a challenge to include in a risk assessment based on pathogen prevalence in ticks. Therefore, TBE was not included in this study. At all sampling sites, we documented microhabitat conditions that may support ticks and tick-borne bacterial pathogens. Large scale habitat features were analyzed using geographical information system (GIS). To collect exposure data, we obtained both residential census data from residential areas surrounding each entry point, and visitor data information from the public count boxes. To identify risk areas for tick-borne diseases in the urban green space, tick hazard and human exposures were integrated into a public health risk scale for each entry point. In addition, we also conducted interviews with visitors to the urban green space. Information from individual respondents provided details on important factors affecting risk of exposure to ticks and tick-borne diseases.\nTick hazard data collection\nIn the summer of 2020, we collected ticks and field data in the areas surrounding the six public count boxes in the nature reserve. Each of the sites was visited twice, once in the beginning of the summer, and once at the end of the summer. Two different sites were visited during the same day, always between 10.00 am and 6.00 pm, and only on days without long-lasting precipitation. Since ticks and field data were collected in the areas surrounding the public count boxes, the site selection was not random. However, at each site, five randomly selected 2 m × 2 m sampling plots were selected. The random plot selection started from the public count boxes. The location of the first sampling plot was determined by holding a compass upside down and randomly rotating the graduation ring to first select a distance between 1 m – 36 m, and next a random compass direction between 0° – 360°. For distance, 10° on the graduation ring equals 1 m. The first sampling plot was used as starting point for selecting the second plot, and so on up to five plots. In total, 60 plots (5 plots × 6 sites × 2 sampling periods) were inventoried for ticks and field data. The coordinates of each random sampling plot were determined with a GPS hand receiver (Garmin eTrex 30).\nTick collection\nIn Northern Europe\n, I. ricinus\nis active from spring to fall with adult tick activity peaking in July – August, and nymph activity peaking in September [\n41\n]. The seasonal activity of\nI. persulcatus\nis unimodal with activities in May – July, with the highest activity peak in May [\n42\n,\n43\n]. Tick sampling was carried out in June, August and September which covers activity seasons for both tick species and encompassed a large portion of their highest activity periods.\nIxodes\nspecies have three life cycle stages including larva, nymph, and adult ticks. In the case of\nI. persulcatus\n, the adult female is the primary stage that attacks humans [\n43\n]. For\nI. ricinus\nall three stages attack humans, but particularly the nymphs, which are the medically most important tick stage [\n44\n]. For this study, all tick stages were sampled to determine the overall tick density in urban green spaces.\nTicks were collected with the mopping technique [\n45\n,\n46\n]. Briefly, we used a floor mop with a 0.7 × 0.7 m flannel cloth attached to the head of the mop (Additional file\n2\n). In contrast to the common dragging technique, the mop is held in front of the user, and is moved anteriorly over the vegetation. The mop handle permits easy adjustments to different vegetation heights [\n46\n]. To estimate the tick density at each site, we inventoried the 5 random 2 m × 2 m plots. To increase the validity of estimates of pathogen prevalence at each site, we sampled more nymphs and adult ticks from the vegetation surrounding the five random plots. The surrounding vegetation was inventoried in random directions measuring the mopping time with an accuracy of 1 s. Total mopping time varied between 2 to 3 min for all sites. Using the average distance walked per second for the user and the width of the sampling blanket we calculated the total area covered, which ranged from 700m\n2\n– 1000m\n2\n, varying with the landscape features at each site. All questing ticks attaching to the blanket were collected with tweezers, put into tubes, categorized according to life stage, and stored at -80ºC. Tick life stage categorization was later confirmed in the laboratory.\nMicrohabitat data collection\nMicrohabitat data was recorded for each 2 m × 2 m sampling plot. The microhabitat conditions included current air\nTemperature\n, average\nVegetation height\nand\nGeneral field layer\nin the sampling plots, as well as the\nTree stem density\nsurrounding each sampling plot.\nTree stem density\nwas estimated using the Bitterlich sampling technique [\n47\n]. To assess the\nGeneral field layer\ncomposition and identify plant species, all 60 sampling plots were photo documented (Fig.\n2\n). These photos were later processed by creating a 16 square grid layer in Power Point to determine the proportion of the\nGeneral field layer\nincluding different plant species in each sampling plot. The\nGeneral field layer\ncategories were\nGrass and herbs, Blueberry bushes, Dry vegetation\n(heather and lichen)\n, Shrubs, Leaves,\nand\nBare ground.\nFig. 2\nExamples of photo-documented sampling plots. The proportion of different field layer categories was used to determine microhabitat conditions\nFull size image\nLand cover data from GIS\nFor characterization of the surrounding habitat, we calculated a median coordinate for each sampling site from the geocoded positions of all five 2 m × 2 m plots. For each median coordinate, a 100 m buffer zone surrounding the sampling site was created and incorporated within a GIS layer together with pre-existing land cover maps. We used the 2018 National Land Cover Database of Sweden (Svenska marktäckedata, SMD), produced by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. These maps have a spatial resolution of 10 m and include six main land cover classes 1) forest and seminatural areas, 2) open areas, 3) arable land, 4) wetlands, 5) artificial areas and 6) lakes and oceans (Swedish land cover nomenclature available in Additional file\n3\n). The main categories are further divided into subcategories with detailed information regarding the different land cover classes. To locate risk habitats based on the biological and ecological requirements for ticks and their associated pathogens, we extracted data on the main land cover classes with the exception for forest and seminatural areas where we included all ten different forest types present in the reserve. Of the ten different forest types, seven forest types were not on wetland;\nSpruce forest, Pine forest, Mixed coniferous forest, Mixed forest, Broadleaved forest, Broadleaved hardwood forest\nand\nBroadleaved forest with broadleaved hardwood forest\n, and three types were on wetland;\nMixed coniferous forest, Mixed forest\nand\nBroadleaved forest.\nThe nomenclature for Swedish land cover includes nonintuitive names with several definitions based on absence from certain features, like “not on wetland”. We have chosen to stick with the names in the nomenclature to allow for comparisons with other studies.\nTo calculate an urbanization index for each site, we used the proportion of\nArtificial surfaces\nin 1000 m buffer zones around the median coordinates for each site. Since Stockholm County is surrounded by water, we subtracted the proportion of\nOpen water\nto adjust for presence of non-tick habitats (Eq.\n1\n). The urbanization index ranges from 0 to 100 with the value 0 representing a completely natural or seminatural area and 100 representing a landscape with only artificial surfaces.\n$$Urbanizationindex=Artificial\\;surfaces\\;\\left(\\text{\\%}\\right)/\\left(100-Openwater\\left(\\text{\\%}\\right)\\right)\\times100$$\n(1)\nLaboratory analyses\nDNA extraction\nDNA was extracted from the medically important tick stages of\nI. ricinus\nand\nI. persulcaltus\n, in total 132 nymphs and 5 adult ticks. DNA was extracted from each of the ticks using the Dneasy Blood & Tissue kit, following the supplementary protocol for detection of\nBorrelia\nDNA (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, California, USA). Each tick was cut with sterile needles along the torso, placed in a 1,5 ml Eppendorf tube with PBS buffer and a 5-mm steel bead (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and homogenized in a Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen) for 30 s at 30 Hz. The concentration of DNA extracted from each individual tick was controlled with a nanodrop©.\nMolecular identification of tick species\nTick species identification was confirmed by molecular identification using a species-specific duplex Taqman real-time PCR essay for\nI. ricinus\nand\nI. persulcatus\n[\n48\n]. Species-specific probes Iri-I2-P4 and Ipe-I2-P4 are designed to target these two tick species (Additional file\n4\n). The reaction mixture consisted of a 20-µl reaction with 10 µl Maxima® Probe qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden), 0.4 µl of forward and reverse primers, 0.3 µl of the probe Iri -I2-P4, and 0.2 µl of probe Ipe-I2-P4, 6.7 µl RNase-free water and 2 µl DNA. As a positive control, cDNA positive for\nI. persulcatus\n, previously confirmed by sequencing was added to each run\n.\nThe\nI. persulcatus\nDNA was kindly provided by Prof Thomas Jaenson (Department of Organismal Biology, Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden) through Dr Peter Wilhelmsson (Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Division of Inflammation and Infection, Linköping University, Sweden). Each run also contained one samples of milliQ water and one with DNA from the three-spine stickleback (\nGasterosteus aculeatus\n) as negative controls. The PCR reactions were performed on the qPCR system CFX96 from Bio-Rad, using an activation step at 95 ºC for 5 min, and 45 cycles of 95 ºC for 10 s and 60 ºC for 60 s.\nDetection of\nBorrelia burgdorferi\n(sensu lato) and determination of species\nDetection of\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) was conducted using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay [\n49\n]. The primers Borrelia-F and Borrelia-R and the probe Borrelia-P are designed to target the\nB. burgdorferi\n16S rRNA gene to amplify a 131-bp long amplicon (Additional file\n4\n). The reaction mixture resulted in a 20-µl reaction consisting of 10 µl Maxima® Probe qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden), 0.4 µl of each primer and probe, 6.8 µl RNase-free water and 2 µl DNA as previously described. In each run, 2 µl of a positive control with DNA extracted from of\nB. garinii\n(0.27*10\n8\ncells/ml) was added.\nB. garinii\n(strain Lu59) was kindly provided by Sven Bergström (Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden) through Dr Peter Wilhelmsson (Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Division of Inflammation and Infection, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.) Each run also contained one sample with 2 µl milliQ water and one with 2 µl DNA from the three-spine stickleback (\nGasterosteus aculeatus\n) as negative controls. The PCR reactions were performed on the qPCR system CFX96 from Bio-Rad, using an activation step at 95 °C for 5 min, and 50 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 60 s.\nTo determine the\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) species of the samples positive in the real-time PCR, a nested conventional PCR using primers targeting the intergenic spacer region (IGS) between\n5\nand\n23S\nrRNA genes (Additional file\n4\n), was applied. Nucleotide sequencing of the nested PCR products to determine the species of\nBorrelia\nwas performed by Macrogen Inc. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing both strands. The chromatograms were edited and analyzed by using BioEdit Software v7.0 (Tom Hall, Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA). The consensus sequences were examined using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). An additional file shows all the aligned sequences (available in Additional file\n2\n).\nDetection of\nBorrelia miyamotoi\nDetection of\nB. miyamotoi\nwas done using a species-specific TaqMan real-time PCR assay [\n50\n]. The primers Bm_F and Bm_R, and the probe Bm_P are designed to target the\nB. miyamotoi\nflagellin B gene (faB) to amplify a 156-bp long amplicon (Additional file\n4\n). The 20-µl reaction mixture, was prepared with 10 µl Maxima® Probe qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Termo Fisher Scientifc), 0.4 µl of each primer (10 µM; Life Technologies; Additional file\n4\n), 0.4 µl of probe (10 µM; Life Technologies; Table\n1\n), 3.8 µl RNase-free water and 5 µl DNA. As a positive control, a synthetic plasmid containing the target sequence of the TaqMan real-time PCR assay was used. The plasmid contained the target sequence, spanning the nucleotides 510–665 of the\nB. miyamotoi\nflagellin (faB) gene (GenBank: KT932823), synthesized and cloned into Eurofins standard vector (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). Each run also contained samples with 2 µl milliQwater and 2 µl DNA from the three-spine stickleback (\nG. aculeatus\n) as negative controls. The PCR reactions were performed on the qPCR system CFX96 from Bio-Rad, using an activation step at 95 °C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 35 s, and lastly one cycle of 37 °C for 20 s.\nTable 1 Microhabitat and habitat effects on tick abundance. Microhabitat conditions in and around each plot were analyzed in generalized linear mixed models with Poisson distribution. The effects from habitat features retrieved from GIS were analyzed in generalized linear mixed models with negative binomial distribution of residuals\nFull size table\nDetection of\nAnaplasma phagocytophilum\nDetection of\nA. phagocytophilum\nwas done using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay [\n51\n]. The primers ApF and ApR, and the probe ApM are designed to target the\nA. phagocytophilum\ncitrate synthase gene (gltA) to amplify a 64-bp long amplicon (Additional file\n4\n). A 25-µl mixture reaction was prepared and consisted of 12.5 µl Maxima® Probe qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Termo Fisher Scientifc), 1.5 µl of each primer and 0.375 µl of probe, 7.125 µl RNase-free water and 2 µl DNA. As a positive control, a synthetic plasmid containing the target sequence of the TaqMan real-time PCR assay was used. The plasmid contained the target sequence, spanning the nucleotides 304–420 of the\nA. phagocytophilum\ngltA gene (GenBank: AF304137), synthesized and cloned into pUC57 vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Each run also contained samples with 2 µl milliQwater and 2 µl DNA from the three-spine stickleback (\nG. aculeatus\n) as negative controls. The PCR reactions were performed on the qPCR system CFX96 from Bio-Rad, using an activation step at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s.\nExposure data collections\nTo characterize human exposure to the tick hazard in urban green spaces, a cross-sectional study design was applied by utilizing both population census data from the residential areas surrounding each sampling site and visitor data from the public count boxes located at the entry point into the nature reserve. In addition, to study how visitors use urban green spaces and to understand the degree to which humans get in contact with infected ticks, we conducted interviews with visitors to the nature reserve.\nPopulation exposure\nTo assess the magnitude of public exposure to the tick hazard, we extracted residential census data available from Statistics Sweden (Statistiska centralbyrån, SCB). Data on number of residents is available in raster format with a resolution of 1km\n2\nin the open Geodata section at SCB. We used data for individual raster cells covering the sampling sites as an estimate for potential daily visitors and an aggregation of 3 × 3 raster cells to cover 9km\n2\naround the sampling site adding information of potential weekend visitors to the nature reserve. Population density provides an estimate of the numbers of residents living next to green spaces inhabited by infected ticks, but not the activity of residents in the urban green space. Visitor count data, on the other hand, can provide accurate estimates of resident’s visits to areas that area frequently used for recreational activities. All residential data was analyzed together with the visitor count data to estimate public exposure to the estimated infected tick hazard.\nVisitor data collection\nThe visitor data information from the six public count boxes was provided by the City of Stockholm. Data included information on visiting dates and average number of visitors for weekdays and weekends during the counting period January – June 2020. For Hellas recreation center only data during the period May – July 2020 was available.\nIndividual exposure\nTo estimate the risk due to ticks and tick-borne pathogens at individual-level exposure, visitors were interviewed on-site at the different entry points to the nature reserve. The survey included questions and about visitors’ motives, behaviors, and movements patterns in different green spaces and in addition, their knowledge about ticks (survey questions available in Additional file\n5\n). This survey was granted exemption from ethical approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority since no personal information was collected as part of the study. Visitors under the age of 18 were not eligible to participate. All respondents were approached in the nature reserve. They were informed that the interviewers were working in a research project about ticks and tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces used for recreation and were asked for a consent to participate in a brief survey regarding their recreational activities and their knowledge of ticks and tick-borne diseases. In addition, all participants were informed that they could stop the survey at any point. Each interview was conducted face-to-face, consisted of 17 questions, and lasted approximately 5 min per interviewee. Finally, to assess the knowledge and awareness of ticks, visitors were asked to identify an\nI. ricinus\nnymphal tick from photos of one tick and two other arthropods.\nData analysis\nAnalyses were performed using R v. 4.2.2 [\n52\n]. Because of the hierarchical nature of the data with tick samples from 5 plots nested within a site replicated at two different sampling occasions, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to analyze the effects of environmental data. Site was included as a random factor to account for the correlative structure within site. The models were analyzed assuming Poisson distributed residuals using package lme4 [\n53\n]. We used a backward stepwise model selection process based on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and selected the most informative models with the lowest AIC score. To ensure that no severe multicollinearity existed between the predictor variables, variance inflation factors (VIFs) were computed for each predictor variable. Because no VIF was larger than 5, we did not exclude any variables due to multicollinearity. Model residuals were checked using the DHARMa package [\n54\n].\nMicrohabitat conditions\nTo assess the relationships between tick abundance and microhabitat conditions, tick abundance was analyzed as a function of the field layer composition measured as the proportional representation of the microhabitat components present in each of the sixty 2 m × 2 m plots. The abundance of tick larvae and nymphs were analyzed in separate models. Each model also included the plot factor\nVegetation height\n, the surrounding\nTree abundance\nas well as the time factor\nMonth\nas predictors. Adult ticks were not included in the statistical analyses due to small sample size. The relationship between pathogen prevalence and microhabitat conditions could not be statistically analyzed due to very few infected ticks sampled in the individual 2 m × 2 m plots.\nHabitat features\nTo assess effects of the surrounding habitat conditions, tick abundance (ticks sampled in the individual plots and surrounding vegetation) was analyzed as a function of the land cover types present in a 100 m radius buffer using GIS. The proportions of the different land cover types were included as fixed predictors. The abundance of tick larvae and nymphs in each sampling plot and from the surrounding vegetation, were analyzed in separate models. Each model also included the plot factor\nVegetation height\n, the surrounding\nTree abundance\nas well as the time factor\nMonth\nas predictors. The site Sickla was divided into two independent sites because of the large geographical distance between the two sampling occasions. The models were fitted with a negative binomial distribution using the glmer.nb function in the package Ime4.\nThe relationship between tick-borne pathogens and environmental factors at habitat level were analyzed with the same predictive variables as in the analyses of tick abundance. However, the response variables were binary representing the presence/absence of pathogens in each single tick.\nB. burgdoferi\n(s.l.) and\nA. phagocytophilum\ninfections were analyzed in two separate GLMM models assuming binomial residual distribution.\nHuman exposure\nCorrelations among population size, visitor counts, tick densities and pathogen prevalence at the different entry points to the urban green space were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. To describe the visitors’ demographics, behavior, and prevention practices, descriptive and inferential statistics were used on the survey data from the interviews. Probability of recreational activity preformed, or use of protective measures was modeled as a response (binomial error distribution) using GLMMs. Age and gender were used as predictors for all three responses, and recreational activity type was included as a predictor for the use of protective measures. Respondents were included as random factor to account for repeated answers concerning activities and protective measures from the same visitor. The probability of identifying a nymphal tick from two other arthropods was analyzed using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with a binomial distribution to evaluate the answers [correct, wrong] using age and gender as predictors.\nPotential risk of tick-borne diseases\nThe potential risk of tick-borne diseases at each entry point was estimated by combining the tick hazard and human exposure estimates to an ordinal value ranging from 1 to 3, where the highest value corresponds to the highest hazard or exposure risk and vice versa. For tick hazard we used the result from a systematic review synthesizing tick densities and pathogen prevalence in Europe from 115 articles [\n55\n]. Based on their description of current situation in Europe we set the cut-off values for nymph and adult tick densities per 100m\n2\nto: 1 (low) < 4 ticks per 100m\n2\n, 2 (moderate) 4 – 10 ticks per 100m\n2\n, and 3 (high) > 10 ticks per 100m\n2\n; and the cut-off values for bacterial pathogen prevalence to: Low < 14%, Moderate 14% – 26%, and High > 26%. The same cut-off values were used for both\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) and\nA. phagocytophilum\n. For exposure estimates to the tick hazard, intervals based on the total range of all visitors per day at the different entry points were set to: Low < 1500 visitors, Moderate 1500 – 2000 visitors, and High > 2000 visitors. Using the sum of all values for hazard and exposure, we estimated the risk to Low 4 – 6, Moderate 7 – 9, or High 10 – 12, for each entry point (details in Additional file\n6\n).\nResults\nTick hazards in urban green spaces\nTicks and tick-borne bacterial pathogens were present at all entry points to the Nacka nature reserve. In total we collected 479 questing ticks, 342 larvae, 132 nymphs and 5 adults. The density of questing nymphs and adult ticks varied from 0.8 to 4.8 per 100m\n2\namong the different sites. All collected nymphs and adult ticks belonged to the species\nI. ricinus\n. Hence, we did not find any\nI. persulcatus\nin Nacka nature reserve. The overall\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) prevalence was 26.7%, ranging from 16.2% to 47.6% among the different sites (Table\n4\n). Of the 44 samples positive for\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) using real-time PCR, we identified 29 (65%)\nB. afzelii\n, 1 (0.02%)\nB. garinii\n, 1 (0.02%)\nB. bavariensis\n, and 1 (0.02%)\nB. burgdorferi\ns.s. (Additional file\n7\n). The rest of the samples were not identified to species level, and therefore categorized as\nBorrelia\nspp. None of the sampled ticks were infected with\nB. miyamotoi\n. The overall prevalence for\nA. phagocytophilum\nwas 28.2% ranging from 7.9% to 58.3% among the different sites. Both\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) and\nA. phagocytophilum\nwere detected at all sampling sites. At the most urban site, only16 nymphs were collected increasing the risk for noticeable random deviations of prevalence data from low number effects on proportional representation of binomial outcomes. In a case like this, the fate of one single individual tick can add 6.25% to the prevalence of one of the pathogens. Therefore, we need to be cautious about the accuracy of the prevalence, but we can still conclude if the prevalence is low, moderate, or high.\nMicrohabitat conditions\nLocal tick densities for both larvae and nymphs were significantly higher in sampling plots where the field layer was low or even absent, compared to sampling plots with high\nVegetation height\n(Table\n1\n). There was also a significantly positive effect of the proportion of\nGrass and herbs\nin the sampling plots (Table\n1\n). The proportion of\nshrubs\nand\nLeaf litter\nin the sampling plots had a significant positive effect on local larva abundance (Table\n1\n).\nDry vegetation\nsuch as heather or lichen, and the ambient air temperature had significant negative effects on local nymph abundance (Table\n1\n). In this study, ticks were collected in temperatures ranging from 11 – 27 °C, and most of the nymphs were collected in temperatures below 24 °C.\nHabitat features\nThe degree of urbanization ranged from 1.5% at Hellas recreation center to 42.8% at Sickla entry point. The proportion of\nArtificial areas\nin the surrounding habitat had a significant negative effect on the presence of tick larvae (Table\n1\n). The proportion of\nBroadleaved forests on wetland\nsurrounding the sampling site had a significant positive effect on the presences of tick nymphs (Table\n1\n). For the prevalence of\nB. burgdorferi\n(\ns.l.\n) there were significant positive effects from the proportion of\nArtificial surfaces\nand\nInland water\n, and negative effects from the proportion of\nOpen areas\n(Table\n2\n). The prevalence of\nA. phagocytophilum\nwas significantly positively affected by the proportion of\nArtificial surfaces\nand\nMixed coniferous forest not on wetland\n(Table\n2\n).\nTable 2 Estimated coefficients for the relationship between the number of ticks infected with bacterial tick-borne pathogens and regression factors of the proportional representation of different surrounding habitat types analyzed with generalized linear mixed models assuming binomial distribution of residuals\nFull size table\nExposure to ticks and tick-borne pathogens\nExposure data represents the potential intensity of contact that people have with ticks and tick-borne pathogens. The entry points Sickla, Kärrtorp and Björkhagen, all close to highly urbanized areas had large human populations living in close proximity (Table\n3\nand Fig.\n3\n). There were also more visitors entering the nature reserve at these points (Fig.\n3\n). The least urban site, Hellas recreation center, had low tick density but high prevalence of tick-borne pathogens (Table\n3\n). The intermediate urban sites Bagarmossen and Klisätra had high tick densities but low prevalence of tick-borne pathogens. Prevalence of\nA. phagocytophilum\nis significantly negatively correlated to tick density, meaning that there can be a high prevalence of\nA. phagocytophilum\nin areas with low tick density (Fig.\n3\n).\nA. phagocytophilum\ninfected ticks are also positively correlated to human population densities, and high prevalence were found in the most urbanized areas of the urban green space (Fig.\n3\n).\nTable 3 Population size as number of residents per 1km\n2\n, and 9km\n2\n, weekday and week-end visitors, tick abundance, tick density,\nB. burgdorferi (s.l.)\n, and\nA. phagocytophilum\nat all studied entry points to Nacka nature reserve\nFull size table\nFig. 3\nCorrelations between human population size close to the entry point (9 km\n2\n) and very close to the entry point (1 km\n2\n), and number of visitors, tick density and pathogen prevalence.

Absence of color indicate a non-significant correlation (\np\n> 0.05). In this correlation matrix Sickla entry point was divided into two independent sites as in the habitat models\nFull size image\nRisk of tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces\nWhen combining the tick hazard with human exposure estimated from number of visitors entering the nature reserve at each entry point, we found that the tick-borne disease risk was low at Klisätra and Bagarmossen, high at Björkhagen, and moderate at all other sites (Fig.\n4\n). At Björkhagen entry point, many visitors enter the nature reserve, tick densities were high, and the prevalence of\nB. burgdorferi\n(s.l.) and of\nA. phagocytophilum\nwere moderate to high (Fig.\n4\n)\n.\nFig. 4\nRisk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens at the differ entry points to Nacka nature reserve\nFull size image\nBehavior and movement patterns among visitors\nA total of 102 visitors to the Nacka nature reserve were interviewed to gather information on sources of exposure to ticks and tick-borne pathogens and behavioral parameters effecting the risk. The study sample included 60 (59%) women and 42 (41%) men. Seventy-five percent of the respondents lived in close proximity (< 500 m) to the nature reserve and visited the area several times per week. However, 25% were visitors from other municipalities or even from other counties.\nSpending time outdoors was a common activity among the visitors and 77% reported that they spend time in urban green spaces several days per week. Walking was the most common activity, followed by swimming, running, and foraging the forest for berries or mushrooms (Fig.\n5\n). When asked about their movement patterns, 85% of the visitors reported that they also walked off-trails when visiting green spaces.\nFig. 5\nActivities performed by visitors in Nacka nature reserve. Foraging includes picking berries and mushrooms, and family time includes having a picknick or having family leisure time. Error bars indicate 95 percent confidence interval\nFull size image\nFifty-eight percent of the visitors reported that they have had several tick encounters during their life span, and 23% percent had several tick-bites every year. Twenty-two percent of the visitors reported having had a tick-borne disease (22 Lyme disease, 1 tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) infection). Among the visitors with a history of a tick-borne disease, 45% had several tick bites every year.\nPreventative behaviors\nThe results from our survey showed that the visitors used individual protective behaviors against ticks when spending time in typical tick habitats or when performing certain recreational activities. Several respondents tried to avoid tick bites by avoiding “typical tick habitat such as tall grass”, and by “performing tick checks” (Table\n4\n). A less common strategy to prevent tick bites was to wear specific clothing including long pants or tucking pants into the socks (Table\n4\n). Most visitor selected clothing depending on the weather or the recreational activity, and not as a strategy to avoid tick bites (Table\n4\n). Protective measures against tick bites were mostly used during activities such as blueberry picking or mushroom hunting. Repellent was sometimes used (Table\n4\n), but mostly with the intension to protect against mosquito bites.\nTable 4 Prevention behaviors reported from visitors to urban green spaces. These protective measures were mostly used when performing certain recreational activities such as picking blueberries or mushrooms\nFull size table\nThree quarters of the visitors were able to identify a tick from other arthropods. For visitors with a history of a tick-borne disease, 100% could identify the tick. Among the visitors with a history of a tick-borne disease, 67% were women. There were no statistical differences between gender, or by different age groups, for the type of recreational activities performed or in usage of preventative measures.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to assess the public health risk of tick-borne diseases in an urban green space used for recreation. Consistent with previous research [\n12\n,\n55\n,\n56\n,\n57\n], we also found high tick densities and pathogen prevalence at most entry points, with tick densities decreasing with increasing degree of urbanization [\n58\n]. However, low tick density was also found at the least urban site, the Hellas recreation center, highlighting the influence of local properties and habitat types [\n59\n]. The Nacka nature reserve has several ecological niches with ideal tick habitats. Tick abundance was in our study area significantly associated with humid broadleaved forest. The highest tick densities were found at Björkhagen entry point, which is located in a lush Birch tree forest. Broadleaved forests provide a humid field layer, where the vegetation and litter layer protect ticks from desiccation during the off-host periods [\n60\n,\n61\n]. Low tick densities were found in drier microhabitats, for example in areas with bare ground or were the forest floor consisted of large proportions of dry vegetation such as heather or lichen.\nTicks infected with\nB. burgdorferi (s.l)\nand\nA. phagocytophilum\nwere found at all entry points, even in the highly urbanized parts of the green space. Pathogen prevalence is most likely determined by habitat conditions allowing ticks, hosts, and pathogens to complete their lifecycles and to overlap [\n62\n]. Stockholm County has a green infrastructure in the shape of a star, with protected green wedges that stretch from the surrounding rural areas all the way into the city. These wedges can serve as an ecological network for wildlife dispersal to urban green spaces. Large vertebrate hosts can utilize these networks bringing ticks to urban areas. Smaller vertebrates and birds inhabiting urban green spaces can be important tick-borne pathogen reservoirs [\n12\n]. Various tick host species have been identified as reservoirs for different\nB. burgdorferi\ngenospecies [\n15\n]. In this study, the rodent-associated\nBorrelia\ngenospecies\nB. afzelii\nwas more prevalent than the bird-associated\nB. garinii\n. Knowledge of the prevalence of different\nBorrelia\ngenospecies is important for public health, because different genospecies are associated with different clinical manifestations [\n63\n].\nRisk of tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces\nRisk assessment of tick-borne diseases requires not only knowledge about the tick hazard, but also information about human exposure to infected ticks [\n64\n,\n65\n,\n66\n,\n67\n]. Models based on epidemiological data, such as tick-borne disease incidence, are advantageous in the way that disease cases unequivocally demonstrate human contact with the pathogen. However, there may also be a mismatch since diagnosed cases may in fact represent infections obtained elsewhere [\n15\n]. Since bacterial tick-borne diseases are not notifiable in Sweden, incidence data is not available. To estimate human contact rates with infected ticks, we used residential census data and visitor count data. The estimates of human activity varied between the different sites in the urban green space. Not so surprisingly, entry points located close to highly urbanized areas had the highest human population densities in the surrounding residential neighborhoods, as well as many entering visitors. Therefore, nearby residential population density data may be a good proxy for estimations of human exposure to tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces.\nA high degree of urbanization can in itself be an important factor affecting exposure. Due to the high proportion of artificial surfaces in the surrounding landscape, there is a risk that individuals engaging in recreational activities underestimate the individual risk of being bitten by an infected tick [\n12\n]. The high prevalence of tick-borne pathogens, even at the most urbanized sites of the Nacka nature reserve, combined with the potential for underestimating individual risk, could lead to increased public health risks from tick-borne infections in urban green spaces. There will of course be differences in the strength and size of the relationship between residential population size and the number of visitors to different urban green spaces. We know that human communities in urban areas can be very diverse in their perception of nature [\n68\n], and that this can lead to large differences in how residents in different areas approach and use urban green spaces. Even if the residential areas around the Nacka nature reserve are heterogeneous and reflect a subset of the different residential areas found around a large urban center like the municipality of Stockholm, we still think that it is important to perform similar studies in other urban green areas in Stockholm as well as in other large cities.\nAll six entry points to the Nacka nature reserve except one, presented a moderate to high public health risk of tick-borne diseases. The highest risk was found at the Björkhagen entry point with high population size, many visitors, moderate density of ticks, and high prevalence of tick-borne pathogens. The least urban site, the Hellas recreation center, has no residential areas within 1km\n2\nand rather few visitors during weekdays. During the weekends, visitors have more leisure time and come to enjoy the nature and a large variety of recreational activities. When recreational activities are performed in tick habitats and for longer periods of time, the possibility for human-tick contacts increases [\n15\n,\n69\n]. If the prevalence of pathogens is high, which is the case at Hellas recreation center, the public health risk of tick-borne diseases will be high.\nWe do not seek to discourage residents from spending time in urban green spaces or participating in outdoor recreation. Instead, we want to identify risk factors for human exposure to infected ticks as a part of the process to prevent individuals from tick-borne diseases and reduce the public health burden associated with these illnesses. In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a longstanding tradition of protecting natural and semi-natural habitats in urban areas, primarily to facilitate recreational activities for urban residents. In several European cities, a maximum distance of 300 – 500 m to the nearest green space is used in planning processes of urban areas [\n8\n]. Given the evident risks of tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces, understanding individual residents’ behavior and movement patterns can be used to design tick bite prevention campaigns [\n69\n,\n70\n].\nOutdoor activity patterns and prevention behaviors\nParticipating in outdoor recreational activities increase the risk of encountering infected ticks, especially in tick hazardous habitats [\n29\n], a concern exacerbated by the rising popularity of such activities among Europeans [\n27\n,\n42\n]. Despite this, few studies have analyzed how different recreational activities may influence the tick-borne disease risk. In our study, most visitors spent several hours per week in green spaces, mainly in urban green spaces close to their residences, while some also visited other urban and rural green spaces in Stockholm County. At the Nacka nature reserve, visitors engaged in various activities, with walking along the paths being the most common. Still many also venture off trails, increasing the risk of tick encounters, especially for those without protective measures [\n29\n,\n56\n]. Recommendations for preventing tick bites include avoiding tick habitats, wearing protective clothing, and performing tick checks after spending time in risky environments [\n71\n,\n72\n]. Despite having a good understanding of ticks, a large discrepancy was found between our respondents’ knowledge about and their adoption of preventative behaviors. The Swedish public health agency advises vaccination against the viral infection TBE in southern Sweden. Although our study focuses on bacterial tick-borne pathogens, we included TBE vaccination as a protective measure in our interviews. Thirty-six percent of the visitors to the urban green space were vaccinated, but many were unsure if they had received booster shots according to recommendations. Regarding protective clothing, visitors often prioritized weather or activity-appropriate attire over tick protection. Repellents were used sporadically, often targeting mosquitoes rather than ticks. Some respondents were opting for alterative repellents such as coconut oil or lavender spray.\nA core principle of the theoretical concepts underpinning many public health risk reduction programs is that knowledge of a health threat is important for adoption of risk mitigation [\n73\n]. Absence of vaccines against bacterial tick-borne infections makes personal protection measures recommended as the first line of defense against ticks. Personal protection measures have the benefit of incurring no or low costs but need consistent use to be effective [\n34\n]. Previous research found that men are less likely to use protective measures against ticks, consistent with the general knowledge of men’s greater risk-taking behavior compared to women [\n33\n]. In our study, we found no significant gender difference in protective behavior or any differences among age groups. Interestingly, most of the visitors with a history of tick-borne diseases were women. Earlier studies also show that women are affected more frequently than men by tick-borne diseases [\n74\n]. However, this may reflect a gender difference in health care seeking behavior [\n75\n]. Notably, visitors with a history of a tick-borne disease also spent time in green spaces several days per week and had multiple tick-bites every year. Therefore, innovative, and evidence-based approaches to improve education on ticks and tick-borne disease and to promote behavior changes in urban green spaces are urgently needed.\nThe wide range of activities performed in urban green spaces may explain some of the large variation in type of, and adherence to, tick bite prevention. Using the green space only for walking generally lead to a limited engagement in protective measures. A few visitors tried to avoid “typical tick habitats” such as “tall grass” or “shrubs” to stay away from ticks. However, we have in earlier studies shown that tick densities are higher in low vegetation [\n46\n]. Therefore, visitors avoiding tall vegetation will be likely to spend more time and make closer skin contact with low vegetation close to the trails increasing the risk for tick-borne diseases. In addition, most of the visitors only applied protective measures, such as wearing long sleeves, and tucking pants into socks, during specific recreational activities such as picking berries and mushrooms.\nLimitations\nThis study is both spatially and temporally restricted, only giving a snapshot of the dynamic system of interactions among ticks, hosts, and pathogens. However, even if we expect a short-term temporal variation, with year-to-year differences in both tick densities and pathogen prevalence, both microhabitat and habitat types will be fairly stable over a rather long period of time, especially in ecosystems where the management strategies aim to conserve specific ecological succession stages. We are using a standardized sampling technique which sometimes results in rather few ticks sampled. This set limitations on the possibilities to estimate the exact tick density and pathogen prevalence. Still, the results from this cross-sectional study show that it is possible to correlate crude tick densities and pathogen prevalence with microhabitat and habitat data in an urban green space and with population census data and visitor count data. The standardized sampling technique also allows us to make comparisons with other similar studies.\nEven though we performed interviews at most sites, we cannot present individual visitor data at the scale of the different entry points. Instead, this data is used to discuss general patterns and individual actions in comparison to population census data, visitor numbers and tick hazard. In assessing human behavior and movement patterns in urban green spaces, we did not account for the visitor’s time spend or the frequency of contact between visitors and vegetation during their recreational activities. Our tick-borne diseases risk assessment in urban green spaces was intended as a test to integrate tick-borne disease hazard, with population exposure both as visitor numbers but also as human activities, behavior, and their prevention practices. Regarding prevention practices, we did not ask the visitors about their beliefs on prevention efficacy. Therefore, further research is needed to better understand the factors that are important for behavioral decision regarding human recreational activities in urban green spaces.\nConclusions\nThe present study highlights the risk of tick-borne diseases in urban green spaces. Our findings can be used for information to the public and for urban green space planning and management. Public health risk estimations can also be useful in decisions regarding vaccination programs for tick-borne diseases. For the moment it is only possible to vaccinate against TBE, but there is ongoing development also for\nBorrelia\nvaccines. Even if there will be no public vaccination programs this information will still be important for individual decisions regarding vaccination against tick-borne diseases. The challenge for public health authorities is to promote increased awareness without causing alarm, so that the residents rather than avoiding outdoor recreational activities continue spending time in urban green spaces.\nAvailability of data and materials\nSequence data is provided within the supplementary information files.

Thus, urbanization has been recognized as a major driver of biodiversity change, often resulting in a decrease in the number of species in urban environments. This loss in mosquito biodiversity in urban areas is a consequence of the simplification of the habitat structures and alteration of trophic interactions [\n2\n]. However, urbanization increases the availability of human-made water habitats, providing more suitable breeding sites for some native and invasive mosquito species in various types of artificial containers [\n3\n]. Invasive species like\nAedes aegypti\nin the US [\n4\n] or\nAedes albopictus\nin Europe have colonized and thrived in urban environments [\n5\n]. Consequently, these changes have led to an increase in the global incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, especially in Europe [\n6\n]. Urban green areas are the locations in cities where the most vegetation cover can be found. Usually, these areas are destined and designed for the citizens to engage with nature, enjoy leisure time, and perform physical activities [\n7\n,\n8\n]. However, these environments harbour the ideal conditions for mosquito proliferation [\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n]. Besides, numbers of predators of mosquitoes, such as fish, amphibians, or aquatic invertebrates, are usually reduced in these urban environments [\n11\n]. Additionally, these green ecosystems provide a wide range of animal and human hosts to feed on [\n12\n]. Therefore, these spaces could serve as hotspots for the proliferation of some mosquito species. A characteristic of urban spaces is the high availability of wastewater drainage systems and artificial containers, which when filled with water become habitats for immature stages of mosquitoes [\n13\n]. Also, urban cemeteries are considered suitable habitats for the proliferation of both native and invasive mosquito species [\n14\n,\n15\n]. These types of environments provide shelter habitats such as bushes and trees for adult mosquitoes as well as immature stage habitats like flowerpots [\n13\n,\n14\n].\nUsually, urban areas are generally warmer than periurban and rural areas because of the urban ‘heat island effect’ [\n16\n]. This effect is caused by the lack of vegetation cover and the presence of cemented areas in these environments [\n17\n]. The urban heat island effect shortens the life cycle of mosquitoes, consequently increasing their abundance [\n18\n]. Among Culicidae,\nCulex pipiens\ns.l. is widely distributed throughout Europe and is the most common species in urban areas [\n19\n,\n20\n]. Besides, species like\nAe. albopictus\n, with an important role in different arbovirus transmissions, has a higher presence in these human-modified landscapes [\n12\n]. This is due to their adaptation and capacity for breeding and developing in artificial and human-made containers (e.g., road drains, flowerpots, cans, or buckets), which not all species are able to use [\n21\n,\n22\n]. Cemeteries are considered adequate hotspots for these invasive mosquitoes, leading to surveillance efforts in these settings [\n15\n,\n23\n,\n24\n]. Therefore, with cities continuing to expand, it is imperative to monitor the distribution and abundance of mosquito species in green and grey areas. This is crucial for their management and control [\n25\n] to prevent mosquito-borne diseases.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the diversity, abundance, seasonal dynamics, larval habitats, and trophic preferences of mosquitoes in urban green areas and urban cemeteries from the three main cities of the Basque Country (northern Spain). A morphological and molecular approach was performed to identify mosquito species, their ecoforms, and/or sibling species. We also evaluated the factors associated with their abundance, species richness, and potential larval sites.\nMethods\nStudy area\nThe study took place in the three main urban areas of the Basque Country, northern Spain: the inland city of Vitoria-Gasteiz (province of Araba), the coastal city of Donostia-San Sebastián (province of Gipuzkoa), and the estuarine city of Bilbao (province of Bizkaia) (Fig.\n1\n). The inland city, Vitoria-Gasteiz, is the capital of the autonomous region of the Basque Country. It has an extension of ca. 276 km\n2\n, with around 250,000 inhabitants and a population density of ca. 898 inhabitants/km\n2\n[\n26\n,\n27\n]. In 2010, the European Union (EU) awarded it the title of 2012 European Green Capital, and in 2019, it was also recognised as a “Global Green City” by the United Nations (UN) due to its environmental policies, green infrastructures, and sustainable mobility [\n28\n]. The estuarine city, Bilbao, covers an area of 41.60 km\n2\n, with ca. 345,000 inhabitants and a population density of ca. 8296 inhabitants/km\n2\n[\n26\n,\n27\n]. Until the 1980s, it was primarily an industrial area [\n29\n]. The coastal city of Donostia-San Sebastián spans ca. 61 km\n2\n, with ca. 180,000 inhabitants and a population density of around 2980 inhabitants/km\n2\n[\n26\n,\n27\n]. Both the coastal and estuarine cities enjoy Atlantic climate, characterised by temperate and wet conditions throughout the year. In contrast, the inland city has a transitional climate between Atlantic and Mediterranean, with cold winters and drier, warmer summers [\n30\n].\nFig. 1\nMap of the Basque Country (northern Spain) indicating the location of the three cities and the six sampling sites: Estuarine city (\na\nCasilda park;\nb\ncemetery); coastal city (\nc\nKristinaenea park;\nd\ncemetery); inland city (\ne\nmunicipal plant nursery;\nf\ncemetery). [\na\n,\nc\n,\ne\n: green urban areas (green diamonds);\nb\n,\nd\n,\nf\n: cemeteries (red circles)]\nFull size image\nIn each city, a green area and a cemetery were selected (Fig.\n1\n). The criteria used to choose these sites was based on easy accessibility, suitability, and lower risk of vandalism. The green areas were in the heart of the selected cities. In the inland city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, the landscaped area is used mainly for gardening, featuring small tree forest patches, greenhouse area, as well as areas with debris and tyres. In the estuarine city of Bilbao, there is an extensive garden with grass, scattered trees, and a large ornamental fountain occupying part of the territory. In the coastal city of Donostia-San Sebastián, there is an extensive, green, leafy, damp, and highly vegetated garden with a wide variety of plant and tree species along with several semi-artificial water pools. A list of the hosts that were most frequently observed during field visits is provided (Additional file\n1\n: Table S1).\nThe three selected cemeteries were different in terms of structure, vegetation, and mainly the number of water-holding containers, probably reflecting distinctive cultural habits. All cemeteries were soil-cemented and had mixed trees and green patches.\nField sampling approach\nMosquito trapping was carried out fortnightly during two periods: from 1 May to 31 October 2019 and from 1 June to 30 November 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 forced us to start the field sampling 1 month later. Two CDC miniature traps (model 1212, John Hock, Gainesville, FL, USA) were deployed in each sampling site, equipped with incandescent light, and baited with ca. 1.5 kg of dry ice (CO\n2\n). Traps were placed at least 100 m apart and were placed on two distinctive habitats. They were positioned in shady, humid, and windless areas as these are locations where mosquitoes tend to rest. All traps were set up early in the morning and recovered 24 h later. In addition, in 2019, mosquito larval sites were searched and sampled once per month in a radius of 200 m around CDC traps. In green areas, immature mosquito stages were collected using a dipper (600 ml) as detailed by González et al. [\n31\n]. These samples were then transported to the laboratory and kept in mosquito breeders (Bioquip Products, USA) until adult emergence. A total of seven, four, and five types of larval sites were inspected each month in the inland city, estuarine city, and coastal city, respectively. In cemeteries, instead of sampling around a 200 m radius of each CDC trap position, we sampled a maximum surface of 2500 m\n2\nper site. The cemeteries of the inland and estuarine cities contained a low number of containers (\nn\n= 149), whereas the cemetery in the coastal city included > 340 containers (Additional file\n2\n: Table S2). The number of containers inspected, number of containers with water, and number of containers positive for mosquitoes are detailed in Additional file\n2\n: Table S2.\nMosquito species identification\nIn the laboratory, mosquitoes were sorted by sex and physiological status (blood-fed, gravid, and unfed). The species identification relied on morphological features of females and male genitalia using taxonomic keys [\n32\n,\n33\n]. Examination of genitalia of males allowed for differentiation between\nCulex torrentium\nand\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. Damaged or morphologically indistinguishable mosquito specimens were identified by molecular methods. Briefly, genomic DNA extraction was carried out with NZY Tissue gDNA isolation kit (NZYTech, Lisboa, Portugal) followed by a PCR targeting  cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) with primers C1-J-1718 and C1-N-2191 as described by Delgado-Serra et al. [\n34\n]. PCR amplicons were then purified using ExoSAP-IT (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) and submitted for Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics, Germany). The sequences obtained were analysed using Geneious Prime software (v.2022.2.2) and compared with the GenBank database through nucleotide sequence homology searches on the network server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using BLAST or at the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) (\nhttp://www.boldsystems.org/index.php\n).\nMosquitoes belonging to the\nAnopheles maculipennis\ns.l. complex were identified to the species level using a PCR-RFLP assay targeting polymorphisms in the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS-2) [\n35\n] with primers described in Collins and Paskewitz [\n36\n]. Similarly, a subsample of the specimens morphologically identified as\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. of each green area and cemetery were analysed by molecular methods (ca. 25%;\nn\n= 146; 44 from 2019 and 102 in 2020) to determine their ecoform (\nCx. pipiens pipiens\n,\nCx. pipiens molestus\n, and its hybrids) by targeting the flanking region of the CQ11 microsatellite [\n37\n].\nHost blood meal analysis\nVertebrate host species of blood-fed and gravid females collected in 2019 were investigated at the Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph (Guelph, ON, Canada). Host feeding patterns were identified using a metabarcoding-like approach with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology as previously described [\n38\n,\n39\n]. Identification was considered valid only when the query sequence matched the reference sequence with at least 95% nucleotide identity. Detailed specimen records and sequence information were uploaded to the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD-\nhttp://www.boldsystems.org\n) and can be found within the Working Group 1.4 Initiative “Human Pathogens and Zoonoses” container “MCBCS-Surveillance of mosquitoes and\nCulicoides\nin the Basque Country, Spain.” The digital object identifier (DOI) for publicly available projects in BOLD is doi:dx.doi.org/\nhttps://doi.org/10.5883/DS-MQBMBC\n.\nData analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using R statistical software version 4.2.0 [\n40\n]. Differences between the abundance of the most trapped mosquito species in green areas and cemeteries were analysed using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Chi-squared test and Fisher exact test were used to evaluate the differences between\nCx. pipiens\necoforms and the type of sampling area (green area vs. cemetery) and city. Multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) were run to evaluate the differences in the overall abundance of mosquitoes (catches/trap/night), related to sampling site (green urban area, cemetery), city (estuarine, coastal, and inland city), year of sampling (2019, 2020), and month of sampling (June to October, shared period for both periods of sampling). A negative binomial generalized linear model (NBGLMs) was employed [\n41\n] because of the data over-dispersion of the mosquito abundance, using the MASS package [\n42\n]. Using the “MuMIn” package and “dredge” function [\n43\n], the best models were selected based on Akaike information criterion and corrected to sample size (AICc). The overall fit of the model was evaluated with a likelihood ratio test, comparing the best model with the null model. Species richness (S) and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H’) were calculated to compare biodiversity among cities, sampling areas, and type of sampling sites (green area vs. cemetery) using the “diversity” function in the “vegan” package [\n44\n].\nResults\nSpecies composition and abundance\nA total of 846 mosquitoes (682 females and 164 males) were collected by CDC suction traps in green areas and cemeteries from the Basque Country (northern Spain). In 2019, a smaller number of mosquitoes (\nn\n= 263, 207 females and 56 males) were captured compared to the catches in 2020 (\nn\n= 583 mosquitoes, 475 females and 108 males).\nMorphological and molecular analyses allowed for the identification of 21 mosquito species (one invasive and 20 native mosquitoes), encompassing six\nAedes\nspp., seven\nCulex\nspp., four\nAnopheles\nspp., three\nCuliseta\nspp., and one\nCoquillettidia\nspecies (Table\n1\n). Among them, three species (\nCx. pipiens\ns.l.,\nCuliseta longiareolata\n, and\nCulex hortensis\n) were found in the three cities. Regarding abundance, the highest mean abundance belonged to the green area of the estuarine city (6.16 ± 1.37) and the lowest mean to the cemetery in the same city (1.20 ± 0.26) (Table\n1\n). Overall mean abundance of green areas was higher (4.13 ± 0.55) than in cemeteries (1.51 ± 0.17) (\nW\n= 8244;\nP\n< 0.001). Interestingly, a single specimen of\nAe. albopictus\nwas captured with CDC traps in the cemetery of the estuarine city in 2020.\nTable 1 Culicidae trapped by baited CDC traps in the six urban environments in the Basque Country (northern Spain) in 2019 and 2020\nFull size table\nCulex pipiens\ns.l./\nCx. torrentium\n(\nn\n= 622, 73.5%) was significantly the most abundant species (\nW\n= 51,945;\nP\n< 0.001), followed by\nCs. longiareolata\n(\nn\n= 118, 13.9%). In all sampled areas, the most captured species was\nCx. pipiens\ns.l./\nCx. torrentium\n, being more abundant in green areas (76.7% of the total catches, 476/621) than in cemeteries (64.9% of the total catches, 146/225) (\nW\n= 8644,\nP\n< 0.001).\nThe molecular analysis yielded 65 barcoding COI sequences of 443–525 bp length with 97–100% homology  compared with GenBank sequences. A selection of these sequences (\nn\n= 21 and 13 species) was deposited in GenBank under accession numbers PP218317-PP218337.\nThe three specimens initially included as\nAn. maculipennis\ns.l. complex were subsequently identified as\nAnopheles atroparvus\n(\nn\n= 1) and\nAn. maculipennis\ns.s. (\nn\n= 2). The inland city harboured the highest species richness with 13 different species, followed by the coastal city (\nn\n= 11) and the estuarine city (\nn\n= 8) (Fig.\n2\n). Shannon’s diversity index (H’) showed a higher diversity in the inland city (\nH\n’ = 1.39), followed by the coastal city (\nH\n’ = 1.24) and estuarine city (\nH\n’ = 0.49). The diversity was identical in both green areas (\nH\n’ = 1.03) and cemeteries (\nH\n’ = 1.03). The highest diversity index was found in the green area of the inland city (\nH\n’ = 1.61) (Fig.\n3\n).\nFig. 2\nVenn diagram represents the Culicidae species found in urban environments of the three main cities of the Basque Country (northern Spain)\nFull size image\nFig. 3\nShannon’s diversity index (H’) by city and type of sampling site\nFull size image\nThe approach to determine\nCx. pipiens\necoforms showed\nCx. pipiens pipiens\n(\nn\n= 82, 56.2%) as the most abundant, followed by the\nCx. pipiens molestus\n(\nn\n= 46, 31.5%) and hybrid form (\nn\n= 18, 12.3%) (Fig.\n4\n). Overall, no significant differences were found between green area and cemetery in the distribution of the three ecoforms (\nχ\n2\n= 1.185,\nP\n= 0.553). No significant differences were found among the three cities (\nχ\n2\n= 4.366,\nP\n= 0.359), the ecoform\npipiens\nbeing the most abundant in all the cities, followed by the form\nmolestus\n(Fig.\n4\n).\nFig. 4\nRelative abundance of\nCulex pipiens\ns.l. ecoforms in the six urban environments in the Basque Country (northern Spain) (number inside the bars corresponds to absolute numbers)\nFull size image\nSeasonal activity\nConsidering the mosquito catches obtained by CDC traps in 2019 and 2020, mosquito flight activity extended throughout the entire sampling period. Population dynamics during 2019 in the three cities showed a moderate increase during the first months of sampling, with peaks in June and August in the coastal city, in July and August in the estuarine city, and June, August, and October in the inland (Fig.\n5\n). In 2020, the estuarine city showed the highest mosquito abundance. All the cities experienced an increase in mosquito abundance during the initial months of sampling, followed by a progressive decline from August onwards (Fig.\n5\n).\nFig. 5\nSeasonal flight activity of Culicidae captured in CDC traps at the three cities of northern Spain in 2019 and 2020\nFull size image\nLarval rearing sites\nEight different mosquito species were identified in larval habitats, including\nCx. pipiens\n,\nCx. torrentium\n,\nCx. hortensis\n,\nCulex territans\n,\nAnopheles claviger\n,\nCuliseta annulata\n,\nCs. longiareolata\n, and\nAedes geniculatus\n. Most larvae were collected from green areas (\nn\n= 319)  compared with cemeteries (\nn\n= 143) (Table\n2\n). Overall,\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. (\nn\n= 340, 73.6%) was the most abundant species in the larval sites from all the sampling areas, followed by\nCs. longiareolata\n(\nn\n= 69, 15.0%) (Table\n2\n). The most prolific mosquito larval sites in green areas were pools of water (semi-artificial ponds), diverse water-holding containers (tyres and buckets), and drainage systems, while in cemeteries flowerpots supported most of the larval abundance and pots and funeral urns to a lesser extent. Larvae were found in all types of water-holding materials in cemeteries (plastic, ceramic, metal, and/or marble).\nCulex pipiens\ns.l. and\nCuliseta\nspp. bred in a wide variety of artificial and natural water-holding containers, whereas\nAe. geniculatus\npreferred to rear exclusively on tree holes together with\nCx. pipiens\n,\nCx. territans\n, and\nCx. torrentium\n, albeit to a lesser extent. The latter was found cohabiting in the same habitats as\nCx. pipiens\n. Interestingly, a single\nAn. claviger\nwas found breeding in a large plastic tray. It is interesting to note that artificial urban lakes might contain larvae of\nCx. pipiens\non the muddy and shady edges. Huge differences were recorded in the mosquito abundance among the three study sites, which was a reflection of the number of available larval sites, i.e. in the green area of the estuarine city and its cemetery few developmental sites were found.\nTable 2 Culicidae species found in larval habitats in the six urban environments studied in the Basque Country (northern Spain) during 2019\nFull size table\nAnalyses of variables affecting mosquito abundance\nThe negative binomial model showed a positive association between the total abundance of mosquitoes with the type of sampling area, being significantly higher in the green areas compared to the cemeteries (Table\n3\n). Moreover, the abundance of mosquitoes collected in CDC traps was also positively associated with the city, the year, and the month of sampling, the abundance being significantly higher in coastal and estuarine cities, in the year 2020, and in the months of July and August (Table\n3\n).\nTable 3 Summary of the best negative binomial regression model for total number of Culicidae per CDC trap and night\nFull size table\nHost DNA blood meals\nFew blood-fed/gravid specimens were captured (\nn\n= 17). Host DNA amplification success in mosquito samples was 47.1% (8/17). Female mosquitoes that failed in identifying host DNA were categorised within advanced Sella stages.\nCulex pipiens\ns.l. fed on seven species of urban birds (Table\n4\n). It was not possible to identify the host DNA blood meal in five\nCuliseta\nspp.\nTable 4 Blood meal host identification in Culicidae in the six urban environments studied in the Basque Country (northern Spain) during 2019\nFull size table\nDiscussion\nGlobalization and landscape anthropization affect the composition, distribution, and abundance of mosquito communities in urban areas, thereby impacting the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases [\n12\n,\n45\n]. Mosquito abundance is linked to landscape composition in urban green spaces [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n10\n,\n46\n]. For example, in some locations, an increased presence of water and aquatic plants is correlated with higher mosquito density, while greater coverage of woodland plants appears to reduce mosquito abundance [\n10\n]. However, other studies showed that the distribution of mosquitoes depends on the life stage and influence of microclimatic conditions [\n47\n]. For this reason, we aimed to extend the study of Culicidae in northern Spain to determine which species inhabit urban areas and assess their potential risk to public health.  The number of mosquito species and their abundance was slightly lower in the current study compared to pristine habitats in the same region [\n48\n]. Therefore, in none of the three cities did health authorities consider the application of adulticidal or larvicidal treatments necessary. Overall, mean abundance per trap and night was low and similar to findings reported in urban areas from other Spanish regions [\n3\n,\n49\n], with\nCx. pipiens\nbeing the most abundant species.\nCulex pipiens\nis the most common and predominant species in urban areas in both Spain and the northern hemisphere, and it serves as a vector of several pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV) [\n50\n] and Usutu virus [\n51\n]. In our study, this species was found breeding in all kind of habitats (15/16 types), whether natural or artificial nature. This species has two ecologically distinct ecoforms and a hybrid; the\nmolestus\nform is usually described as the below-ground form, mammophilic, and capable of laying eggs without a blood meal [\n32\n], while the\npipiens\nform is an ornithophilic above-ground form [\n52\n]. This ecoform categorization is well defined in northern parts of Europe, but in southern Europe, this distinction is not as clear [\n52\n]. In our study, like in other studies carried out in urban areas of the Iberian Peninsula [\n49\n,\n53\n],\nCx. pipiens pipiens\nwas the most abundant form followed by\nCx. pipiens molestus\n. However, in some other Spanish regions,\nCx. pipiens pipiens\nare more frequently found in natural areas [\n54\n]. Interestingly, our study showed no differences in the frequency of these forms between green areas and cemeteries. Regarding hybrids, the percentage found in this study (12.3%) is lower compared to levels observed in other Spanish regions [\n49\n]. These differences might be attributed to host availability and habitat conditions, which might favour hybridization.\nAlong with\nCx. pipiens\ns.l.,\nCs. longiareolata\nis considered the second most abundant and widely distributed species in many regions of Spain [\n55\n]. This mosquito species is commonly found breeding in artificial containers in urban environments [\n56\n]. In our study, this species was recorded developing in artificial habitats (track tyres, buckets, flowerpots, funeral urns, small pools of water, and sewer systems) in both green areas and cemeteries.\nCuliseta longiareolata\nis considered ornithophilic [\n32\n] but also feeds on mammals, including humans [\n57\n]. Although it has been considered of low interest for public health, this species could potentially act as vector of avian pathogens [\n33\n].\nOur study also showed that the highest mosquito abundance was recorded in the green urban areas, especially in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic took place. This difference could be explained by climatic variables (not recorded in this study) or by the management of green areas, which, due to the pandemia, were neglected and presumably more resting sites and hiding places were available compared to the previous year. The green areas investigated in this study showed a higher diversity of mosquitoes than the cemeteries. Most of the species found in green areas and cemeteries have been reported in previous studies conducted in the territory.\nAedes geniculatus\n, however, has only been previously identified through egg analysis by molecular tools in\nAedes\nsurveillance programs [\n58\n]. This mosquito species exhibited aggressive biting behaviour towards humans during the field work. Small size water-filled holes in alder trees (\nAlnus\nsp.) were used by this species as developmental sites, in line with other studies [\n59\n]. Notably, most of the species found in our study have also been recorded in nearby naturalised areas [\n48\n]. This is the case of\nAedes caspius\n,\nAedes detritus\n, and\nCulex modestus\n, which usually breed in brackish and saline water [\n60\n,\n61\n,\n62\n], that have been found in estuarine and coastal cities. Only five specimens of\nAe. rusticus\nwere found in the green area from the inland city, which suffers more extreme climatic conditions than the estuarine and coastal cities, both located near the coast and influenced by a mild Atlantic climate. This could explain the limits of the distribution of\nAe. rusticus\n.\nCemeteries are widely recognized as ideal locations for mosquito proliferation as they provide multiple habitats for their development [\n24\n]. Urban cemeteries are also very accessible and frequently visited, providing blood sources from either visitors or on-site workers [\n63\n]. However, the productivity of cemeteries as reservoirs of immature mosquito larvae depends on many factors, such as cultural practices and religious customs [\n13\n]. This explains why the cemetery in the coastal city was very productive in terms of the number of water-filled containers, particularly flowerpots and funeral urns, while the larval sites in the other two cities were scarce or inexistent. This may be due to the different management of the individual cemeteries, where visitors are encouraged to minimize the flowerpots in the graves and monuments. Cemeteries are also routinely surveyed in Europe to monitor invasive\nAedes\nspecies such as\nAe. albopictus\n,\nAedes japonicus\n, and\nAe. koreicus\n[\n63\n,\n64\n,\n65\n]. In fact, in our study a single specimen of\nAe. albopictus\nwas captured in one of the three cemeteries investigated, although this invasive species has been present in the Basque Country since 2014 [\n66\n]. Although the tiger mosquito is currently widely distributed in the region [\n58\n], it seems that the population density at the time of sampling was still not high enough to be collected. It is also interesting to note that a second invasive\nAedes\nspecies (i.e.\nAe. japonicus\n) present in the Basque Country [\n58\n,\n67\n] was not recorded in the study.\nIn our study we found that multiple artificial containers in cemeteries might serve as larval sites for mosquito species such as\nCx. pipiens\ns.l./\nCx. torrentium\n,\nCs. longiareolata\n, and\nCx. hortensis\n. Interestingly,\nCx. hortensis\nwas exclusively detected in cemeteries by both CDC traps and larval dipping. Despite limited knowledge about the phenology and general biology of\nCx\n.\nhortensis\n[\n32\n], this species is commonly found in Spain, France, Italy, and Greece up to central Europe [\n68\n]. In our study,\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. was the most abundant species sampled in the immature stage. However, previous studies carried out in the same area indicated that\nCx. hortensis\nwas the most abundant species found in larval habitats in urban areas [\n31\n].\nFrom the 21 species of mosquitoes identified in cemeteries and urban green areas,\nAe. albopictus\nhas a real impact on human health [\n69\n].\nCulex pipiens\ns.l.\n, Cx. modestus\n, and\nAe. detritus\nhave also been confirmed to be vectors of WNV in Europe [\n70\n,\n71\n,\n72\n], with\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. being one of the most important vector species of this pathogen [\n73\n,\n74\n]. Other mosquito species such as the ornithophilic\nAedes vexans\n, which primarily feed on birds, have been found to be a competent vector in the transmission of WNV, acting as a bridge vector between birds and humans [\n75\n,\n76\n].\nAnopheles plumbeus\nhas gained interest in Europe as it has been identified as a potential malaria vector [\n77\n,\n78\n,\n79\n]. Besides, among the members of the\nAn. maculipennis\ncomplex, it is relevant to note the detection of\nAn. atroparvus\nin the green area of the inland city, as it is a recognised historic vector of malaria [\n77\n].\nBlood meal analysis is a fundamental tool for understanding the ecology of mosquitoes [\n80\n], as their feeding habits are critical factors in the transmission of vector-borne pathogens [\n81\n]. Owing to the low number of blood-fed specimens recorded in our study, it is difficult to establish robust conclusions. Nonetheless, the trophic habits of\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. showed a pronounced preference for avian hosts, in line with previous works performed in urbanised habitats [\n39\n], even when other mammal hosts, such as pedestrians and dogs, may coincide with the peak time of mosquito activity. However, in the metropolitan area of Barcelona,\nCx. pipiens\nshowed preference for birds but also for humans, dogs, and cats [\n82\n]. Host choice is host dependent as seen in the urban zoos of Barcelona where\nCx. pipiens\nalso showed mixed feeding habits [\n83\n].\nConclusions\nThis study provides new insights into the abundance and mosquito community composition in green urban areas and cemeteries of northern Spain. Despite the relatively low abundance of mosquitoes in urbanized areas, the most trapped species are regarded as crucial vectors for various pathogens. Therefore, health authorities should adopt a multi-faceted approach to mosquito management, including the implementation of biological treatments in mosquitoes breeding sites and the removal of water-filled containers. Other effective strategies may include community engagement and education programs to raise awareness about reducing stagnant water areas in residential and public spaces. Regular inspection and maintenance of drainage systems to prevent water accumulation, as well as the use of environmentally friendly larvicides to target mosquito breeding grounds could further bolster control measures. Collaborative efforts among health departments, local authorities, and community participation can enhance the efficacy of control programs aimed at reducing mosquito populations and the risk of associated disease transmission. Besides, the current results indicate that\nCx. pipiens\ns.l. is the most common taxon of the Culicidae family in urban areas, exhibiting an ornithophilic feeding preference. A better understanding of the trophic behaviour/preferences of these Diptera pests can contribute to understanding the transmission patterns of pathogens of public health interest.\nAvailability of data and materials\nAll data are included in the article and in the Supplementary information.\nReferences\nWilke ABB, Chase C, Vasquez C, Carvajal A, Medina J, Petrie WD, et al.

        "abstract": "Vegetation has a well-known potential for mitigating urban overheating. This work aims to explore the effects of enhancing urban greenery in Melbourne (Australia) through a configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model including the Building Effect Parameterization and the Local Climate Zones and presents novelties in: i) covering two-months and ii) focusing on air circulation and buildings cooling energy demand through the ventilation coefficient (VC) and the cooling degree hours (CDHs). A control case and two “what-if” scenarios with a growing green coverage equal to 35 % (control case), 50 % (modest increase) and 60 % (robust increase) have been designed and then simulated for January and February 2019. Outcomes reveal a maximum drop in 2 m temperature of approximately 0.4 °C and 0.8 °C at 14:00 LT for the modest and robust green increase scenario, respectively. The urban-rural energy surplus for cooling buildings is reduced and even counterbalanced. Peak CDHs decrease from 143 °C·h of the control case to 135 °C·h (modest increase) and 126 °C·h (robust increase), while they measure 137 °C·h in the non-urban areas. Average wind speed increases by 0.8 m/s (equal to 22 % with respect to the control case). Furthermore, adding urban greenery has an unfavorable implication on VC (maximum reduction of 500 m2s−1) with a consequent deterioration of the transport and dispersion of pollutants. Middle- and high-density classes are touched more than low-density by the VC reduction. In addition, the benefits of enhancing urban greenery concern physiologically and psychologically the quality of life of the dwellers.",

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"The Sustainable City: The Characteristic Public Urban Green Space for Enhancing Community Social Sustainability in Baghdad\" investigates the relationship between urban green spaces and community social sustainability in Baghdad, making it directly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. The study puts forth a strong argument that public green areas serve as vital components of urban infrastructure that not only improve ecological sustainability but also enhance social interactions and community cohesion. The authors define social sustainability in the context of urban settings as reliant on the availability and quality of green spaces which facilitate community activities, provide recreational opportunities, and create environments conducive to social engagement and bonding.\n\nDirect relevance to the claim stems from empirically identifying that community well-being is significantly linked to the usability and accessibility of urban green spaces. The authors employed a qualitative research approach, conducting interviews and surveys to collect data on residents' perceptions, experiences, and engagement with green spaces in Baghdad. This methodology provides a grassroots perspective on how these spaces are utilized by the community, thus enabling insights into their practical impact on social well-being.\n\nThe findings reveal that residents with easy access to well-maintained green spaces report higher levels of community engagement and satisfaction. For instance, areas designated for community gardening, play areas for children, and spaces for social gatherings were highlighted as essential elements for fostering social ties among residents. Furthermore, the study presents a case for urban planning policies that prioritize the development of inclusive and accessible green spaces, essential for the socio-economic revitalization of urban areas.\n\nIn terms of evidence quality, the paper presents both quantitative data from surveys as well as qualitative insights that enrich the statistical findings. The mixed-methods approach strengthens the validity of the results, showcasing how different demographics interact with green spaces. However, a significant limitation is the geographical focus on Baghdad, which may affect the generalizability of the findings to other urban environments with differing cultural, climatic, and social contexts.\n\nThere are also potential biases to consider, particularly in the choice of participants who may self-select based on their affinity for green spaces. This might skew perceptions toward more positive views of urban greenery, potentially neglecting voices from residents who may not utilize these spaces due to barriers such as socio-economic factors or lack of safety. Moreover, as the research was conducted during a specific period marked by social and environmental stressors, it may not capture longer-term trends regarding community well-being and urban green space interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper offers substantiated arguments that urban green spaces enhance community well-being through various mechanisms of social interaction and sustainability, further research is needed across diverse urban contexts to establish a more comprehensive understanding of this relationship. The recommendations made by the authors for policy makers to consider the social implications of urban green design are essential for achieving holistic urban development goals, promoting both well-being and sustainability on a larger scale.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Evidence suggests that access to urban green spaces (UGS) may encourage physical exercise and impact nutritional status and health. Nevertheless, the quality of UGS is an understudied area. Novel digital tools allow the analysis of urban environments. This study aims to explore the quality of UGS and its association with obesity in Córdoba, Argentina, using Google Street View (GSV) images. Study design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Methods: Lifestyle and sociodemographic data were collected in Córdoba, Argentina (n = 1322 adults) during 2020–2022. Anthropometric measurements were obtained. Buffers of 500m were established around dwellings to identify the presence of large-area UGS (≥1ha). The quality of 226 UGS was evaluated across specific dimensions using a multi-dimensional assessment tool adapted for remote monitoring through GSV. Two-level logistic regression models for obesity outcome (yes/no) were fitted using a random intercept to account for spatial variability. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated as measures of association. Results: Obesity was present in 25.9 % of participants. The UGS quality dimensions that showed an inverse association with obesity were safety (OR = 0.33; 95 % CI 0.32–0.82), potential usage (OR = 0.42; 95 % CI 0.21–0.81), surroundings (OR = 0.54; 95 % CI 0.31–0.93), access (OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.31–0.97), aesthetics (OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.34–0.87) and amenities (OR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.42–0.91). Proximity to UGS was not significantly associated with obesity. Conclusions: Rather than their proximity, the quality of the UGS might play a key role as a determinant of obesity. In urban areas, digital tools such as GSV are useful to explore these topics.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Exploring the quality of urban green spaces and their association with health: An epidemiological study on obesity using Street View technology' provides substantial insights into the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. The authors utilized innovative methods to analyze the relationship between the quality of urban green spaces and various health outcomes, specifically focusing on obesity as a key indicator of community well-being. This analysis is significant as obesity is often linked to broader health issues, thereby impacting community health overall. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The study directly investigates the relationship between urban green spaces and health outcomes. By employing an epidemiological approach to assess the quality of urban green spaces, the paper contributes to the discourse on how environmental factors influence physical health. The authors argue that the quality of urban green spaces—not merely their presence—plays a crucial role in community health. Therefore, their findings may support the broader claim that not only are green spaces beneficial, but there are qualitative aspects which significantly affect community well-being. This aligns with existing literature that correlates the presence of greenery with lower obesity rates and improved mental health, thus reinforcing the claim of enhanced community well-being through green spaces.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed in the study is particularly noteworthy for its innovative use of Street View technology to assess urban green space quality. The authors adapt the Urban Greenspace Quality Assessment Tool to evaluate various dimensions of green spaces, such as accessibility and surrounding characteristics. The epidemiological approach allows for a quantitative analysis of the relationship between these quality attributes and obesity rates. The use of individual data collection also adds robustness to the findings, as it facilitates a more personalized analysis of how green space interacts with diverse community demographics. This methodological rigor enhances the validity of the presented evidence, confirming that the study is backed by a comprehensive dataset that reflects real-world conditions. However, while the methodology is commendable, it is crucial to acknowledge that reliance on digital assessments could overlook qualitative attributes that a physical site visit might reveal.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings of this study have significant implications for urban planning and public health policy. By demonstrating that high-quality urban green spaces are associated with lower obesity rates, the research advocates for intentional design and maintenance of these spaces within urban settings to enhance community health. This contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that improving green spaces can be a viable strategy in combating urban health problems. Furthermore, the paper articulates the need for policy interventions that focus on both the creation and the enhancement of the quality of urban green spaces as a means of improving community health metrics. This is particularly pertinent in light of urbanization rates and associated health challenges faced by contemporary societies.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Despite the study's strengths, limitations should not be overlooked. The primary biases could stem from the reliance on Street View technology, which may not completely capture the real-time dynamics of urban spaces and their perceived quality by community members. Additionally, factors such as socio-economic status and cultural differences may mediate the relationship between green space quality and health outcomes, which requires a more nuanced analysis that the current study may not fully address. Furthermore, while the focus on obesity provides a specific health metric, the overall concept of community well-being encompasses a broader scope, including mental health, social cohesion, and access to recreational opportunities. As such, future research should broaden its focus beyond physical health indicators to provide a holistic view of urban green spaces' impact on community well-being.",

Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people.Maintaining functional and biodiverse urban green spaces is fundamental for liveable cities (cf. SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20. As a consequence of decades of beneficial soil management practices, such as the application of compost21, urban garden soils may not always 1Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Department of Soil Sciences, Ackerstrasse 113, 5070, Frick, CH, Switzerland. 2Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, Zürcherstrasse 111, 8903, Birmensdorf, CH, Switzerland. 3University of Neuchâtel, Institute of Biology, Functional Ecology Laboratory, Rue Emile-Argand 11, 2000, Neuchâtel, CH, Switzerland. 4ETHZ, Department of Environmental System Science, Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Universitaetstrasse 16, 8092, Zurich, CH, Switzerland. 5University of Konstanz, Department of Biology, Ecology, Universitätstrasse 10, 78464, Konstanz, DE, Germany.

Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2. Final most parsimonious SEM connecting garden management (land-use types, management intensity), urbanisation, plant and soil fauna diversity with soil multifunctionality (AICc = 288.3, Fisher’s C = 24.3, P = 0.93). Arrows represent unidirectional relationships among variables. Black arrows denote significantly (p < 0.05) positive and red arrows significantly negative relationships (Table 3). Dashed grey arrows represent non significant relationships (p > 0.05). The thickness of paths has been scaled based on the magnitude of the standardised regression coefficient. Conditional R2s, based on the variance of both the fixed and random effects, as well as marginal R2s, based on the fixed effect parts for each component models are given in the boxes of the response variables. Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Direct and indirect effects of urban gardening on aboveground and belowground diversity influencing soil multifunctionality\" offers essential insights into how urban gardening contributes to community well-being through enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services. Urban green spaces, particularly those developed through gardening, can provide various benefits including fostering biodiversity, improving soil health, and creating spaces that encourage community interaction and mental health improvements. The investigation conducted in Zurich provided robust evidence of the direct and indirect benefits of urban gardens. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The authors assert, \"Urban gardens are popular green spaces that have the potential to provide essential ecosystem services, support human well-being, and at the same time foster biodiversity in cities.\" This directly supports the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. By establishing the link between gardening practices and ecological health, the research underscores how gardens can enhance not only biodiversity but also the quality of soil, which is critical to sustaining plant life and supporting food production within communities. Furthermore, it notes that increased plant diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem, which is essential for supporting broader community health. \n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed involved a systematic investigation across 85 urban gardens in Zurich, focusing on the relationships between plant diversity, soil fauna diversity, and soil multifunctionality. By analyzing 600 plant species alongside 18 species of earthworms and 39 species of springtails, the research utilized a comprehensive approach to illustrate the complex interactions within these ecosystems. The article divides the analysis into components related to above-ground plant diversity and below-ground microbial and faunal diversity, signaling a thorough examination of the interactions across two crucial ecological layers. Overall, the evidence quality appears robust due to extensive site sampling and diversity assessments, although a possible limitation could stem from the geographic focus, which might affect the generalizability of results to different urban contexts worldwide.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings are significant for several reasons. Firstly, the positive correlation between plant diversity and soil fauna suggests that urban gardening practices can bolster not just aesthetic and recreational components of community life but also vital environmental functions. The study points out that enhanced soil multifunctionality—exemplified by better nutrient cycling, water retention, and support for organismal habitats—can translate into greater resilience of urban ecosystems. Such properties are paramount in the face of urbanization and climate change, as they promote sustainable urban environments. Moreover, healthier gardens directly influence human well-being by facilitating cleaner air and potentially enhancing local mental health through engagement with nature, which is crucial for urban populations often above burdened by urban stressors.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Despite its strengths, the study has limitations. The geographic specificity to Zurich could imply that findings might not be directly applicable to cities with different climates, demographic dynamics, or levels of gardening engagement. Additionally, while the study assesses diversity and multifunctionality, it lacks a deeper dive into the social dimensions of urban gardening, such as community interactions or mental health outcomes directly linked to these spaces. Finally, the researchers acknowledged the potential biases in garden management intensity affecting their results, suggesting that variability in how gardens are maintained may influence the observed relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper distinctly supports the claim by demonstrating how urban green spaces, especially through gardening activities, can enhance community well-being by fostering biodiversity, improving soil health, and providing essential ecosystem services. By framing urban gardens as vital components for sustainable urban living, it encourages further exploration into ways of promoting these spaces within community planning and engagement initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Access to greenspace in the form of urban parks is frequently used to study the mental health benefits of nature and may alleviate depression. However, there is a lack of research that considers the different types of vegetated and non-vegetated spaces that parks can provide. Our aim was to investigate whether different types of accessible park area, grassy; tree covered; and non-vegetated, were associated with depressive symptoms among older (≥50 years) urban US adults. We used interviews from the Health and Retirement Study spanning 2010 through 2016 as our primary data source. We calculated total grassy, tree covered, and non-vegetated park space accessible to participants using a comprehensive national database of US parks and a high resolution (10 m) landcover dataset. To measure depressive symptoms, we used the CESD-8 analyzed as a continuous scale. We used Poisson regression to estimate the percent difference in CESD-8 scores comparing quartiles of accessible park space. To control for confounding, we adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, geography, and climate. Aggregated accessible park area was not substantively associated with depressive symptoms. However, having grassy park area near the home was associated with as much as 27 % fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, non-vegetated park area was associated with up to 54 % more depressive symptoms. Our findings were robust to adjustment for air pollution, environmental noise, and artificial light at night. Different types of accessible park space may have disparate effects on mental health among older urban US adults.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Different types of greenspace within urban parks and depressive symptoms among older U.S. adults living in urban areas' is directly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being, particularly through their impact on mental health in older adults. The research discusses how diverse types of greenspaces, including parks, can influence depressive symptoms, suggesting a link between the presence and quality of greenspaces and improved psychological outcomes. This aligns with the broader understanding that access to nature can enhance community well-being by providing opportunities for relaxation, socialization, and physical activity. The methodological approach taken in this study involves a comprehensive assessment of greenspace exposure and its relationship to depressive symptoms, utilizing a robust dataset from a national health survey that includes validated measures of depression. Such a strong methodological foundation enhances the credibility of the findings, indicating that different types of greenspaces can have varying effects on mental health outcomes. Significant findings illustrate that not only the presence of greenspace but its specific characteristics may play a crucial role in alleviating depressive symptoms in urban-dwelling older adults. For example, areas with more diverse vegetation types versus utilitarian grassland-only parks demonstrated notable differences in mental health metrics. These indicators present essential implications for urban planning and public health policy, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating varied greenspace designs that can cater to diverse community needs and preferences. However, the study is not without limitations. One of the primary concerns is the potential for self-report bias in the assessment of depressive symptoms and the subjective nature of greenspace quality perceptions. Furthermore, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow for definitive causal inferences regarding the longitudinal impact of greenspace on mental health. There is also a concern regarding selection bias, as the study focused on older adults within specific urban areas, which may not be representative of all demographics experiencing depressive symptoms in various urban contexts. Addressing these limitations in future research will be essential for advancing our understanding of how urban green spaces can be optimally integrated into community design to enhance overall well-being.",

        "abstract": "Background: A large body of evidence connects access to greenspace with substantial benefits to physical and mental health. In urban settings where access to greenspace can be limited, park access and use have been associated with higher levels of physical activity, improved physical health, and lower levels of markers of mental distress. Despite the potential health benefits of urban parks, little is known about how park usage varies across locations (between or within cities) or over time. Methods: We estimated park usage among urban residents (identified as residents of urban census tracts) in 498 US cities from 2019 to 2021 from aggregated and anonymised opted-in smartphone location history data. We used descriptive statistics to quantify differences in park usage over time, between cities, and across census tracts within cities, and used generalised linear models to estimate the associations between park usage and census tract level descriptors. Findings: In spring (March 1 to May 31) 2019, 18·9% of urban residents visited a park at least once per week, with average use higher in northwest and southwest USA, and lowest in the southeast. Park usage varied substantially both within and between cities; was unequally distributed across census tract-level markers of race, ethnicity, income, and social vulnerability; and was only moderately correlated with established markers of census tract greenspace. In spring 2019, a doubling of walking time to parks was associated with a 10·1% (95% CI 5·6–14·3) lower average weekly park usage, adjusting for city and social vulnerability index. The median decline in park usage from spring 2019 to spring 2020 was 38·0% (IQR 28·4–46·5), coincident with the onset of physical distancing policies across much of the country. We estimated that the COVID-19-related decline in park usage was more pronounced for those living further from a park and those living in areas of higher social vulnerability. Interpretation: These estimates provide novel insights into the patterns and correlates of park use and could enable new studies of the health benefits of urban greenspace. In addition, the availability of an empirical park usage metric that varies over time could be a useful tool for assessing the effectiveness of policies intended to increase such activities.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Quantifying urban park use in the USA at scale: empirical estimates of realised park usage using smartphone location data\" provides significant insight into how urban green spaces, specifically parks, are utilized by communities across the United States. The relevance of this research to the claim that \"Urban green spaces enhance community well-being\" is high, as it empirically measures park usage, which is an essential factor in evaluating the benefits that these spaces provide to urban populations.\n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The paper's findings directly contribute to the discussion surrounding urban green spaces and their impact on community well-being. By quantifying park usage through smartphone location data, the authors offer a concrete basis to understand how frequently these green spaces are accessed by various demographic segments. They underline that active engagement with parks not only suggests physical activity but also implies social interaction and mental health benefits. This aligns closely with the claim, as increased use of urban parks typically correlates with improved community cohesion and individual well-being. Furthermore, the data collected galvanized by technological advancements presents a shift from anecdotal evidence of park usage to a more rigorous, statistical approach, thereby strengthening the argument that these spaces play a critical role in enhancing urban residents' quality of life.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed in this paper is a notable strength. Utilizing smartphone location data allows for an unprecedented level of granularity in understanding park usage patterns across diverse urban areas. The authors analyzed data collected from millions of users across 22,735 urban census tracts, yielding robust empirical estimates of park usage. This large-scale data collection method enhances the evidence quality, as it transcends reliance on survey self-reporting, which can often underrepresent actual usage due to response bias. The employment of such technology-driven analytics also provides disaggregated insights that reflect patterns segmented by demographic variables such as age, socio-economic status, and ethnicity, which are vital for understanding how various communities engage with green spaces.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings underscore that urban parks are heavily frequented, reiterating their importance as communal spaces that foster health and social interaction. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for urban planning and public health policy, arguing that enhanced access and promotion of these spaces could lead to increased physical activity levels, thereby improving overall community health outcomes. The paper advocates for the integration of park access in urban policy discussions, highlighting that investments in green spaces can yield substantial returns in community well-being metrics. The reported usage patterns not only validate the existing theories that posit a positive correlation between green space access and enhanced well-being but also suggest actionable insights for policymakers and urban developers.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: However, the paper does acknowledge several limitations that must be considered. One notable limitation is the digital divide; not all demographics use smartphones equally, which can result in biased park usage data that may over-represent tech-savvy or affluent populations. Consequently, urban planners might not capture the full spectrum of park engagement among less connected groups, potentially leading to skewed policy formulations. Additionally, while the smartphone data offers a comprehensive view of where individuals are, it does not elucidate the quality of the experiences or activities occurring within these parks, an angular aspect that directly affects community well-being. Future research should consider qualitative methodologies alongside quantitative data to holistically assess how park use translates into enhanced well-being outcomes in diverse urban communities.",
