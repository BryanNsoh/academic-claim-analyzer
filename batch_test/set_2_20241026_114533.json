Introduction\nSince the 1950s, the world has entered a phase of rapid urbanisation. By the 21st century, urban development has increasingly tended towards high density [\n1\n]. It is estimated that by 2030, over 60% of the world’s population will be living in urban areas [\n2\n]. A densely developed urban artificial environment exerts tremendous pressure on urban resources [\n3\n] and raises concerns regarding the negative impacts on the health and well-being of urban residents [\n4\n]. For instance, crowded urban populations can foster and exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases [\n3\n]; highly intensive urban environments increase the risk of severe mental disorders among residents [\n5\n]; various urban pollutants can significantly raise negative emotions [\n6\n]; and a high-pressure and fast-paced urban lifestyle leads to chronic fatigue, stress, and anxiety, making people more prone to chronic diseases, such as obesity [\n7\n] and hypertension [\n8\n]. The relationship between urban green spaces and public health has always been a focal point in urban planning research [\n9\n]. Studies have shown that mental health issues are the most easily overlooked health crises, even though the state of mental health is crucial to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as a whole [\n4\n].\nClark et al. were the first to establish a link between the built urban environment and mental health and identify green spaces as one of the most significant factors [\n10\n]. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that exposure to green environments positively affects mental health [\n11\n,\n12\n]. Jonides et al. found that walking in natural environments such as forests is more effective in reducing fatigue, restoring attention, and enhancing cognitive abilities than walking in urban areas based on grey spaces [\n13\n]. Some researchers have found that urban residents living in areas with higher levels of greenery generally experience lower psychological stress and higher life satisfaction [\n14\n,\n15\n]. Other studies have indicated that exposure to green environments, such as wooded green spaces in cities, with their rich biodiversity and multi-sensory experiences, can improve sleep quality, reduce the incidence of emotional disorders, and mitigate behavioural deviations caused by negative emotions [\n16\n]. The prevalence of activities such as forest therapy [\n17\n], the 20 min park effect [\n18\n], horticultural therapy [\n19\n], and restorative gardens [\n20\n] further supports the notion that interacting with green spaces, whether next to or within urban areas, is an effective way to improve physical fitness, alleviate stress, and restore attention.\nStress Reduction Theory (SRT) and Attention Restoration Theory (ART) hold significant positions in research on the multifaceted positive impacts of green environments on psychological restoration [\n21\n]. In 1979, Roger Ulrich proposed the SRT, which posits that exposure to natural environments can reduce mental and physical stress, enhance cognitive ability and behavioural performance, and promote health improvement [\n22\n]. The ART, proposed by Stephen Kaplan in 1983, identifies four characteristics of natural environments that aid attention restoration—Being away, Extent, Compatibility, and Fascination—which help recover directed attention fatigued by the demands of daily life [\n21\n]. Experts and scholars are working to further elucidate the mechanisms through which green spaces affect residents’ mental health. Dong et al. found that green visual exposure, the green view index, and the green space ratio positively impact residents’ mental health, with different measurement indicators having different mediating variables in their pathways of influence [\n9\n]. Zhao et al. investigated the effect of audio-visual combinations on the perceived restorative potential of urban green spaces and demonstrated that the degree of matching between auditory–visual associations and visual landscapes is crucial for enhancing the restorative capacity of sounds [\n23\n]. Other studies have indicated that visual, hearing, and smelling inputs in green spaces contribute to psychological restoration, thereby alleviating stress and attention fatigue [\n24\n,\n25\n]. Although the health benefits of green spaces have been confirmed, the specific mechanisms through which they operate are still being explored, with sensory landscapes in green spaces being essential.\nSensory experiences typically include vision, hearing, smell, tactile sensations, and taste, which are the most direct ways humans perceive the world. Green spaces provide positive stimulation to the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and touch, relax nerves, and regulate brain waves, thereby eliminating fatigue and uplifting the spirit [\n19\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]. As early as the late 18th century, sensory experiences were used as an important therapeutic method to treat psychological disorders, such as neurasthenia [\n28\n]. Studies on the psychological restorative benefits of visual stimuli indicate that spatial, colour, and form designs in landscapes can create a sense of changing scenery, thereby providing rich visual experiences and achieving mental healing. In terms of hearing experiences, Vanhecke et al. emphasised that a balanced combination of natural sounds, especially birdsong, could better promote human health [\n29\n]. Regarding smell, pleasant and suitable scents can soothe nerves, calm the mind, and relieve stress [\n30\n]. Rich and pleasant tactile experiences in green spaces can stimulate visitors’ desire to explore an area, enhancing their sense of participation and identification with the environment [\n31\n]. In terms of taste, Hill pointed out that taste is actually a combination of smell, flavour, and texture, with smell playing a major role [\n32\n]. The Association for Psychological Science states that the influence of taste on psychological restoration is relatively minor compared to other senses [\n33\n]. Taste is usually less directly associated with environments that do not provide food and beverages, and the taste experiences available in urban spaces are limited, typically found only in certain sections of botanical gardens where edible plants are present [\n30\n]. Therefore, this study focuses on sensory experiences related to vision, hearing, smell, and tactile stimuli.\nSeveral studies have explored the relationship between urban green spaces and residents’ mental health, as well as potential mediating factors [\n34\n]. For example, green spaces can promote mental restoration by improving air quality [\n35\n], reducing noise [\n36\n], and providing visual stimulation [\n37\n]. Additionally, green spaces can enhance residents’ physical fitness and foster neighbourhood interactions by providing spaces for outdoor and social activities [\n34\n], thereby increasing life satisfaction and mental relaxation. However, research on the specific mechanisms by which sensory experiences affect psychological restoration remains limited [\n38\n]. Studies have shown that human perception of the external world is formed through the interaction of multiple sensory organs [\n39\n]. A theory by the German aesthetician Fechner emphasises the importance of multi-sensory integration in aesthetic experiences, suggesting that only through the combined action of multiple senses can people fully and deeply appreciate beauty [\n40\n]. However, existing research has largely focused on the impact of single dimensions of sensory experience, particularly vision [\n37\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n44\n] and hearing [\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n,\n47\n], as well as the combined effects of visual and hearing stimuli [\n23\n,\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n]; relatively few studies have examined other sensory organs or multi-sensory integration [\n51\n]. Regarding sensory experience indicators, previous research has primarily focused on perception and quality. Perception can be understood as ‘whether a particular sensory experience in the environment is present or noticed’ [\n52\n]. Xu et al. integrated multi-sensory perception, behavioural experience, and landscape preference into a single framework, demonstrating that perception can serve as a key evaluation factor for sensory landscapes in green spaces [\n52\n]. Quality refers to whether a particular sensory experience in an environment brings about subjective well-being or pleasure [\n53\n]. In fact, previous studies using single/multi-sensory scales did not distinguish between the two sensory characteristics of perception and quality. Descriptors indicating quality (e.g., ‘harmonious man-made landscape’ or ‘rich colours’) and perception descriptors without subjective adjectives (e.g., ‘animal sounds’) often appeared at the same category [\n52\n]. To avoid introducing researchers’ subjective biases and explore the different effects of perception and quality, this study sets separate questions for these two indicators. Furthermore, based on the experiments by Liu et al. [\n54\n], the variety of sounds in the environment is also a key factor in visitors’ sensory experiences. This study hypothesised that similar effects may occur in other sensory experiences, leading to the introduction of the variety indicator. Additionally, most related research has been limited to longitudinal studies of urban green spaces as a broad category, lacking a systematic exploration of how different types of urban spaces promote psychological restoration through sensory experiences [\n55\n]. These gaps provide important research directions and entry points for this study.\nThis study aimed to explore the impact of sensory experiences on psychological restoration by comparing walking and sitting in three different urban spaces. Specific research questions included the following: (1) What are the differences in sensory experiences between walking and sitting in a built environment, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces? (2) What are the differences in the psychological restoration effects of walking and sitting in built environments, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces? (3) How do these sensory experiences collectively influence psychological restoration? This study aimed to reveal the unique role of sensory experiences in different urban spaces and uncover the mechanisms by which sensory experiences affect psychological restoration, thereby providing scientific evidence for green space design and environmental therapy.\n2. Materials and Methods\nAccording to experimental methods in a large number of previous studies regarding the restoration effect of different types of space on people [\n5\n], it is relatively common and effective to select appropriate groups of people as samples and fill in scales after completing the corresponding experimental procedures in sites. Based on our experimental goals, we chose this approach and made corresponding designs for the experiment.\n2.1. Study Sites\nField experiments were conducted in various urban spaces within the city of Edinburgh, selected for their distinct characteristics. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is renowned for its unique history and culture, with architectural styles that blend medieval and Georgian influences. The city’s streets are winding, lined with bustling shops and interspersed with numerous green spaces.\nScholars have classified urban spaces into three categories: large-scale urban green infrastructure, such as public parks and urban forests; small-scale urban green infrastructure, such as community gardens; and grey infrastructure, such as streets [\n56\n]. Other studies have defined public green spaces within urban environments as natural or semi-natural areas and spaces modified by human activity [\n57\n]. Based on previous research, this study identifies and categorizes three types of urban spaces for comparative analysis according to the degree of exposure to greenery and the built environment experienced by people within these spaces. The categories are as follows: built environment (BE), which includes urban spaces where the average green view rate is less than 30% throughout the area; semi-natural green space (SGS), which encompasses urban spaces with an average green view rate between 30% and 70% across the area; and natural green space (NGS), defined as urban spaces with an average green view rate exceeding 70% throughout the area (\nFigure 1\n). For the experiments, Grove Street, Gardner’s Crescent Community Garden, and the Rock Garden at the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Garden were chosen as the experimental sites corresponding to these three types of spaces, respectively, with detailed location descriptions provided in\nTable 1\n.\n2.2. Participants\nForty participants (male: female = 1:1), aged 20–33 years were recruited through social media. All of the participants were current students from various disciplines at the University of Edinburgh. They were asked to maintain a regular schedule and avoid staying up late for three days before the experiment. During the experiment, they were required to abstain from alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and food intake, as well as refrain from using electronic devices and communicating with other participants. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. No physical or physiological data were collected. All of the participants remained anonymous and provided signed informed consent. This study did not require submission to the ethics committee for review, according to the University Research Ethics Policy of the University of Edinburgh.\n2.3. Experimental Design\nThe same experimental procedure was applied across the three different experimental sites, as follows: Before entering the site, participants were guided to a rest area where the researchers explained the purpose of the study, the experimental procedure, and the data analysis methods. The participants voluntarily signed a written consent form and provided their basic information (gender, age, and major). Next, the participants completed the Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS) [\n58\n,\n59\n] and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS) [\n60\n,\n61\n] before entering the experimental site. The first phase of the experiment involved a 10 min walk within the site, during which the participants were free to choose their own visiting routes. After the walk, the participants were asked to complete the ROS, SVS, Perceived Restorative Scale (PRS) [\n62\n,\n63\n], and a sensory experience scale [\n52\n,\n53\n,\n64\n,\n65\n,\n66\n], as well as answer open-ended questions about their sensory experiences and psychological restoration. Subsequently, the participants were required to sit on a bench within the site and observe the surrounding environment for 10 min. After this observation period, they were asked to complete the same set of scales and answer the open-ended questions again. The experiment at each site lasted 40–60 min (\nFigure 2\n).\nAll 40 participants participated in the experiments at all three sites, with group sizes ranging from 1 to 6 participants per session. The participants were instructed to quietly, independently, and freely experience the sites to minimize the impact of participants on each other [\n5\n]. During the experiment, environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, illumination, and decibel levels were measured (\nAppendix A\n), and these measurements were used to control for environmental influences on the experimental results. A Kruskal–Wallis H test showed no significant differences in these environmental variables across different sites. The experiment was conducted from 7 May to 5 June 2024, with the timing determined by Edinburgh’s temperate maritime climate and latitude. May to June is springtime in Edinburgh, when outdoor conditions are favourable and the experimental sites offer a rich sensory experience. The specific dates of the experiment were arranged according to the participants’ schedules and weather conditions (sunny days). The participants completed the entire experimental procedure at all three sites, either between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM or between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM (\nFigure 2\n).\n2.4. Measurements\nDuring the experiment, the participants were asked to complete the ROS, SVS, PRS, and sensory experience scales (the items for each scale are detailed in\nTable 2\n). All of the scales were measured using a 7-point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nFirst, the ROS is based on the SRT and ART and is used to assess participants’ psychological responses in natural and green spaces [\n58\n,\n59\n]. Second, the SVS focuses on individuals’ intrinsic motivation, energy levels, and positive emotions, reflecting their vitality and health status in daily life [\n60\n]. The PRS, also based on the ART, is used to evaluate participants’ perceived restorative potential in specific environments, particularly how well these environments help alleviate psychological and physiological fatigue [\n62\n]. The scale covers several environmental characteristics, such as Being away (i.e., whether the environment helps participants temporarily escape daily worries), Extent (i.e., the expansiveness and coherence of the environment), Fascination (i.e., the environment’s ability to attract participants’ attention), and Compatibility (i.e., the degree to which the environment aligns with participants’ expectations). The PRS comprises 22 items [\n63\n]. As the PRS is specifically designed to assess attention restoration, this study omitted the item ‘My attention and alertness are significantly improved here’ from the original ROS.\nThe sensory experience scale addresses four sensory dimensions: vision, hearing, smelling, and tactility. As described in\nSection 1\n, based on previous research and expert consultations, we used perception, quality, and variety as indicators for each sensory experience and developed the corresponding scales (\nTable 2\n). Perception refers to the awareness and experience of environmental landscape elements through various senses, emphasising the amount and intensity of information received by an individual [\n52\n]. Quality refers to the overall satisfaction and enjoyment of various sensory experiences, focusing on the harmony and comfort of these experiences [\n53\n,\n64\n,\n65\n]. Variety refers to the number and types of different sensory experiences, reflecting the richness and variability of sensory experiences [\n66\n].\nFinally, to further clarify the specific content of the sensory experiences provided by the three urban environments and their effects on the participants, as well as to supplement these scale results, we set two open-ended questions. The first question aimed to understand the participants’ perceptions of sensory landscape elements in the three urban spaces: ‘Please describe in a sentence your most memorable visual, hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences in site you just visited (you may skip any sense that did not leave an impression)’. The second question explored participants’ subjective physiological and psychological changes: ‘Please describe in a sentence how you felt and what changes you experienced after visiting the site (you may discuss your feelings or changes in psychological, physiological, or any other aspects)’. The participants were instructed to answer freely, with no word limits.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nSPSS 27.0 was used to perform statistical analysis on the data collected from the 40 participants using various scales. First, a reliability analysis was conducted on all the data obtained from the ROS, SVS, and PRS, as well as the sensory experience scales. The Cronbach’s alpha for the ROS was 0.895, and for the SVS it was 0.869. The Cronbach’s alphas for the dimensions of the PRS scale—Being Away, Extent, Fascination, and Compatibility—were 0.958, 0.962, 0.751, and 0.948, respectively, with an overall Cronbach’s alpha of 0.963. For the sensory experience scales, the Cronbach’s alphas for the vision, hearing, smelling, and tactility dimensions were 0.879, 0.745, 0.849, and 0.929, respectively, with an overall Cronbach’s alpha of 0.928. All reliability coefficients exceeded 0.7, indicating high internal consistency. Next, following the research framework outlined in\nFigure 3\n, a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted using SPSS 27.0 to compare the differences between places and various intervention modes. Additionally, a linear mixed effects model was established to explore the sensory indicators that significantly influenced psychological restoration. For the open-ended questions, text mining analysis was performed using KH Coder, and the relationships between high-frequency words, places, and intervention modes were visualised.\n3. Results\n3.1. Sensory-Experience Differences across Places and Intervention Modes\n3.1.1. Results of the Repeated Measures ANOVA of Scales\nTable 3\nindicates that place had a significant effect on all types of sensory experience. Pairwise comparisons for hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences were consistent in the order of NGS > SGS > BE. The trend for visual experience scores was similar to that of the other three senses, whereas the difference in visual experience between the SGS (M = 4.479, SD = 0.151) and BE (M = 4.629, SD = 0.154) was not significant. Intervention mode had no significant effect on any of the four sensory experiences, and the interaction between place and intervention mode was not statistically significant. However,\nFigure 4\nillustrates that the degree to which different sensory experiences were influenced by the intervention modes varies, with the hearing experience being the least affected (\nFigure 4\nb). Additionally, in all three places, the participants’ tactile experiences were consistent—Walking > Sitting.\nThe results of the repeated measures ANOVA for the three indicators of perception, quality, and variety are presented in\nFigure 5\n.\nFigure 5\na shows that the trends for smell and tactile perception scores across different places were similar, in the order of NGS > SGS > BE. Similarly, visual perception in the NGS was significantly stronger than in the other two urban spaces. However, people were more likely to notice hearing landscapes in the SGS. In terms of sensory quality,\nFigure 5\nb shows that all four senses followed the order NGS > SGS > BE, although the visual difference between the SGS and BE was not significant. Regarding sensory variety,\nFigure 5\nc shows that the NGS offered significantly more variety across all four senses than the SGS. The variety of hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences in the SGS was much higher than that in the BE. However, in terms of vision diversity, the BE offered more variety than the SGS.\n3.1.2. Text Mining Results About the Open Question on Sensory Experiences\nThis study analysed the co-occurrence network of high-frequency words (correlation coefficient > 0.1) from the responses to the first question to explore the impact of the three urban spaces and different intervention modes on sensory experience. In the co-occurrence network shown in\nFigure 6\n, the most frequently occurring words are primarily nouns and adjectives. Nouns represent specific elements in an environment that attract sensory attention, whereas adjectives reflect the positive or negative nature of these experiences. Across all intervention modes in the three environments, high-frequency words related to visual landscapes outnumbered those related to other sensory experiences. However, in the NGS, high-frequency words associated with non-visual sensory experiences were significantly more prevalent than those in the SGS and BE, which aligns with the trends observed in\nFigure 5\nfor sensory perception and variety.\nAdditionally, many nouns in the BE co-occurrence network were associated with artificial elements and were accompanied by more negative adjectives. The participants in the BE typically noted streets/roads, hurried people, vehicles such as trucks, bridges, shops such as cafés, entry doors, and small private gardens. They frequently reported hearing vehicles, construction, sirens, and people talking. Tactile experiences often involved buildings, walls, steps, and stones, whereas smell experiences were associated with exhaust, stench, and garbage. Although the participants occasionally described their visual experiences in BE in positive terms such as ‘good’, ‘beautiful’, ‘lovely’, and ‘interesting’, negative adjectives such as ‘bad’, ‘dirty’, ‘uncomfortable’, ‘monotonous’, ‘noisy’, and ‘cold’ were more common. By contrast, text analysis for the NGS revealed that participants generally perceived the space to be rich in natural elements, high in the degree of exposure to greenery, less in the built environment experienced by people, and conducive to positive sensory experiences. Descriptions frequently included terms such as ‘beautiful landscapes or scenery’, ‘birdsong’, ‘talking’, and the ‘sounds of waterfalls and streams’. Tactile experiences involved natural elements, such as grass, leaves, rocks, pine, and petals, whereas smelling experiences were linked to the scents of grass, vegetation, and streams. Participants commonly used positive adjectives like ‘good’, ‘pleasant’, ‘relaxing’, and ‘comfortable’ to describe their experiences in the NGS. The SGS was perceived as a middle ground between the NGS and BE. Consistent with the repeated measures ANOVA results in\nTable 3\nand\nFigure 4\n, the sensory experience ranking across the three urban spaces was as follows: NGS > SGS > BE.\nFurthermore, text analysis of sensory experiences showed that, in all urban spaces, participants tended to focus on specific, static objects while walking, whereas their visual perception expanded while sitting, allowing them to capture more dynamic moments. For example, in the BE, walking participants were more likely to notice streets, plants, shops, and cafés, while sitting led them to focus more on vehicles, people, and bridges. In the NGS and SGS, sitting broadened participants’ observations beyond the immediate environment, introducing words like ‘blue’ and ‘cloud’ to describe the sky. While sitting in the NGS, participants also noted flying insects and passing pedestrians, and in the SGS, they paid attention to dynamic elements such as dogs playing in the grass and elderly people exercising. Tactile and smell experiences were affected by the intervention mode across different spaces. Sitting tended to limit participants’ tactile and smell perceptions, restricting their attention to nearby surroundings and resulting in less diverse experiences than walking. Text analysis suggested that the intervention mode had minimal impact on hearing input.\n3.2. Restorative Effects Differences across Places and Intervention Modes\n3.2.1. Results of the Repeated Measures ANOVA of Scales\nTable 4\nshows that different urban space types have a significant impact on ROS and SVS scores. In terms of promoting mental relaxation and calmness, as well as enhancing vitality, the scores for the three spaces follow the following order: NGS > SGS > BE. Additionally,\nTable 2\nindicates that the interaction between place and intervention mode had a statistically significant effect on ROS and SVS scores. To further explore this, we conducted a simple effects analysis for place and intervention mode separately (\nTable 5\n) and combined it with\nFigure 7\nto obtain the following results: in both the NGS and SGS, participants’ scores were higher after entering sites, indicating that spaces with a higher average green view rate and those farther from boundary to the built environment could make individuals feel more energised, refreshed, relaxed, and clear-headed, although this effect was less pronounced in SGS. In the BE, whether walking or sitting, scores on both scales were lower than before entering the space, indicating the negative impact of the BE on psychological restoration. However, walking in the BE did not significantly affect subjective vitality.\nFor the PRS scale,\nTable 6\nshows that the space type had a statistically significant effect on the scores for Being away and Compatibility. According to the pairwise comparison results, the order of scores for these two dimensions across the three spaces was consistent—NGS > SGS > BE. This indicates that urban spaces with a higher average green view rate are more effective in helping individuals escape from daily tasks and stress, making it easier for their needs and expectations to be met, thus facilitating better mental restoration. However, the intervention mode and its interaction with place did not have a significant impact on the scores in these two dimensions. Similarly, Fascination showed significant differences only between spaces. Pairwise comparison results indicated that the scores for the NGS (M = 5.156) and SGS (M = 5.247) were similar, and both were significantly higher than those for the BE (M = 4.116), suggesting that green, natural spaces are more conducive to restoring directed attention than grey, artificial spaces. The Extent score showed significant differences between the different types of urban spaces (\np\n< 0.001) and was influenced by the intervention mode (\np\n= 0.037). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the scores for the SGS (M = 3.780) and BE (M = 3.709) were similar and both much lower than those for the NGS (M = 6.261). Sitting was found to be more effective for escaping daily concerns and meeting individual expectations, whereas walking was more effective for perceiving the expansiveness and coherence of the space (\nFigure 8\n).\n3.2.2. Text Mining Results about the Open Question on Restorative Effects\nFor the participants’ self-reported psychological experiences in different places and intervention modes, we applied a correspondence analysis and visualised the two key characteristic dimensions from the results. In\nFigure 9\n, the circles represent high-frequency words, and the squares represent places and intervention modes. Their positions and directions indicate the similarities or differences between objects, and the quadrants show the classification of objects across different dimensions. The percentage for each dimension reflects its importance in explaining the total variance in the data (Dimension 1 accounts for 42.46%, and Dimension 2 accounts for 26.05%). Consistent with the previous analysis, the mental restorative effects in the BE and NGS differed significantly, with the SGS falling between the two. In the BE, both sitting and walking are closely associated with negative emotion words such as ‘irritated’, ‘nervous’, ‘bored’, ‘annoying’, ‘noisy’, and ‘irritable’. In the SGS, both sitting and walking are linked with words like ‘calmer’, ‘quiet’, ‘sleepy’, and ‘stable’, reflecting the comfortable psychological state provided by this environment. Additionally, words like ‘meditation’, ’thought’, ‘think’, ‘association’, and ‘daily’ suggest that participants in the SGS can escape daily worries, immerse themselves in the green space, and engage in deep reflection, although they may also feel ‘cold’ while sitting. In the NGS, both sitting and walking are associated with words such as ‘relax’, ‘calm’, ‘comfortable’, ‘safe’, ‘deep breath’, ‘good’, ‘happy’, and ‘curiosity’, indicating that the NGS fosters positive emotions and provides effective psychological restoration.\n3.3. Sensory Experiences as Predictors of Psychological Restoration\nTo further investigate the sensory factors that significantly impact psychological restoration, we treated 12 sensory factors (vision perception, vision quality, vision variety, hearing perception, hearing quality, hearing variety, smell perception, smell quality, smell diversity, tactile perception, tactile quality, and tactile variety) as fixed effects variables, and the results from three psychological scales (ROS, SVS, and the four dimensions of PRS) as dependent variables, to construct a linear mixed effects model. The fixed effects were selected based on a stepwise model simplification using multiple linear regression analysis. The final fixed effects, along with place and intervention type as random effects, were included in the model. The best-fitting model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (\nTable 7\n). The residuals of the final model followed a normal distribution, with no significant autocorrelation, and all Variance Inflation Factor values were below 5.\nTable 7\nindicates that ROS scores are significantly associated with hearing quality, vision quality, smell quality, hearing perception, and vision perception, with hearing quality, vision quality, and hearing perception playing a particularly crucial role. For the SVS scale, smell quality, tactile perception, and hearing variety were statistically significant. Furthermore, analysis of the PRS revealed that vision perception, vision quality, hearing perception, and hearing quality were essential for Being away. Extent was significantly influenced by vision quality, vision variety, tactile variety, and hearing quality. Fascination was significantly affected by tactile quality, smell perception, vision variety, and vision quality, and, to some extent, by smell quality. Compatibility was significantly affected by vision quality, hearing quality, tactile variety, and vision perception. Additionally, place was included as a random effect in the four models related to the PRS to account for data variations not explained by fixed effects.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Sensory Experiences and Psychological Restoration Effects across Different Places and Intervention Modes\nPrevious studies have consistently demonstrated that in urban spaces, green areas with a higher presence of natural elements exhibit stronger restorative effects, whereas green spaces dominated by built elements tend to have weaker restorative effects [\n67\n,\n68\n,\n69\n]. Even within restorative environments, the positive effects can vary depending on the specific environmental setting [\n5\n]. The findings of this study support this perspective. In all the psychological scales (ROS, SVS, PRS), the NGS with abundant vegetation, wildlife, water features, and varied topography scored the highest. These were followed by the SGS that are surrounded by urban roads and buildings and feature lawns and limited vegetation. By contrast, grey spaces (the BE), characterised by an abundance of artificial elements and minimal front-yard greenery, showed the lowest restorative effects and may even have had negative impacts.\nThis study also found that different types of urban spaces resulted in significantly different sensory experiences. The overall evaluations of vision, hearing, smell, and tactile sensation, as well as the scores for each sense on the dimensions of perception, quality, and variety, generally aligned with the order of psychological restoration effects, namely, NGS > SGS > BE.\nHowever, in terms of vision experience, the difference between the BE and SGS was not significant. Further analysis of specific indicators revealed that while the BE showed higher vision variety, its vision quality was lower than that of the SGS. The BE, represented by the street, includes a variety of visual information. For example, in the first open-ended question, many participants visually focused on buildings, shops, and entry doors along the street, with these elements providing readable text and increasing colour richness. However, such complex and diverse visual elements do not necessarily contribute to a sense of pleasure. Vehicles, traffic signs, and other elements often detract from the aesthetic appeal of a landscape [\n43\n]. Moreover, the results of hearing perception indicate that the ranking of the three urban spaces (SGS > NGS > BE) was the exact opposite of the decibel levels recorded by the researcher (BE > NGS > SGS), suggesting that, in urban environments within the 40–70 dB range, people’s attention to sound is not determined by objective loudness [\n70\n]. To some extent, people become accustomed to certain noises in a street environment and ignore them [\n71\n,\n72\n,\n73\n,\n74\n,\n75\n], although some of the participants still noted the disruptive nature of traffic and construction noises. Combined with psychological restoration outcomes (\nTable 3\nand\nTable 4\nand\nFigure 5\nc), the ROS scores in the BE significantly decreased after entering, and the Fascination score in the BE was much lower than that in the other two spaces. This indicates that individuals in the BE still experienced high levels of stress and were unable to achieve a state of relaxation, comfort, and clear, rational thinking. The findings also suggest that the BE lacked attractiveness and failed to capture individuals’ attention naturally. Consequently, the BE led to residents being unable to immerse themselves in their surroundings, with diminished and fragmented attention, making it easier to overlook sounds in the environment. According to the text analysis results (\nFigure 6\n), in the two green spaces, positively rated sounds, such as birdsong, talking, wind, and water, attracted attention. In the SGS, vehicle and construction noises that disrupted these natural and harmonious sounds also received attention. Combining the evaluations of sensory perception and variety with the text analysis results (\nFigure 5\na,c and\nFigure 6\n), we found that the sensory experiences in the BE and SGS were primarily based on vision and hearing stimuli, whereas the NGS offered significantly richer tactile and smell experiences than the other two places. This multi-sensory experience enhances the sense of immersion and contributes to psychological restoration [\n76\n]. This was also reflected in the Extent scores during activities in the NGS, which are much higher than those in the BE and even higher than those in the SGS. This suggests that urban spaces closer to nature can provide sufficient opportunities for exploration and good coherence and connectivity among environmental elements, allowing people to become immersed in the setting and lose track of time [\n77\n]. By contrast, small green spaces or entirely artificial environments segmented by man-made elements have limitations in providing consistency and a sense of security.\nUnlike the impact of space type, the main effects of intervention modes on sensory experience were not significant. Hearing experiences across the three spaces remained largely consistent regardless of intervention mode. This can be attributed to the three-dimensional nature of sound, which can propagate widely through space [\n78\n], meaning that environmental sounds can be heard by individuals even at a considerable distance from the source. Additionally, as environmental sounds such as traffic, wind, water, and talking are persistent [\n79\n], and participants in this study were only required to stay briefly at the three experimental sites, they may have been exposed to similar auditory inputs within that short time frame, thereby reducing the impact of the intervention mode on the hearing experience. In terms of tactile experience, walking was found to be better than sitting. This is because sitting limits the range of physical activity and narrows the field of vision, thus reducing the level of interaction with the environment and significantly decreasing the number of objects that can be touched or that evoke a desire to touch [\n80\n]. Correspondingly, in terms of psychological restoration effects, Extent of the PRS, which assesses whether the environment provides sufficient scope and depth, was also influenced by similar factors; scores were higher during walking than sitting across all spatial types. Sitting restricted the participants’ interactions with the environment through close-range senses (tactile), leading to lower evaluations of the expansiveness and coherence of the space. Moreover, while walking, people are more likely to observe stationary objects, whereas sitting in one corner of a site allows for an expanded field of view, making it easier to observe dynamic moments. This phenomenon is related to human visual attention and perception mechanisms; during movement, the visual system reduces its sensitivity to dynamic backgrounds to minimise distractions, allowing for a greater focus on obstacles in the path. When sitting, with the body requiring little movement, the visual system is less burdened and can allocate attention more freely, thus providing it more resources to process dynamic information in the surrounding environment [\n81\n,\n82\n]. Additionally, frequent movements of the head and eyes during walking can make it more difficult for the visual system to capture fast-moving objects, whereas while sitting, the stability of the viewpoint makes it easier for the visual system to detect subtle movements, enhancing the perception of dynamic events [\n83\n].\n4.2. The Mechanism by Which Sensory Experiences in Space Influence Psychological Restoration\nThis study confirmed that different types of urban spaces stimulate people’s senses, leading to diverse environmental experiences that can have varying positive or negative impacts on psychological restoration.\nThe results indicated that sensory quality was positively correlated with various psychological assessment metrics, whereas perception and variety exhibited uncertainty. This suggests that sensory experiences of the environment are not necessarily better when they are clearer or more diverse. According to\nTable 7\n, vision perception primarily affects the ROS and Being away and Compatibility of the PRS, and it does so negatively. This implies that the stronger and more attention-grabbing the visual stimuli in the environment, the more difficult it is for people to relax, leading to increased mental clutter. Additionally, such environments are less effective in helping individuals forget their daily worries and satisfy their personal needs, ultimately hindering psychological restoration. This finding is consistent with the results reported by Yakinlar and Akpinar [\n84\n]. Based on\nFigure 5\na and\nTable 4\nand\nTable 6\n, it can be inferred that in spaces such as the BE (represented by streets) and SGS (represented by community gardens), visual distractions from negative artificial elements (e.g., vehicles, streets, construction, and buildings) make it challenging for people to establish a pleasant and natural connection. Moreover, Fascination of the PRS is negatively influenced by smell perception and vision variety. This may be because strong odours and complex landscape features can cause stress and distract attention, making it difficult for individuals to focus on their current environment [\n84\n,\n85\n]. However, the findings of this study differ from those of Li et al., who found that combinations of multiple visual elements offer better restorative benefits than single elements [\n50\n]. Therefore, further research is needed, such as conducting separate experiments for each metric, controlling variables, and setting up multi-gradient comparisons, to better understand how ‘smell perception’ and ‘vision variety’ influence perceived restoration, stress levels, and psychological health.\nTable 7\nshows that compared to other senses, vision and hearing play a primary role in the scores of various psychological indicators, with vision quality being a key positive predictor of stress recovery and attention restoration. This finding is consistent with numerous studies [\n47\n,\n50\n,\n52\n]. Research indicates that 85% of human environmental perception is derived from visual input, while 10% comes from hearing input [\n31\n]. This underscores the crucial role of vision and hearing in processing external information, as changes in environmental cues perceived through these senses can significantly influence an individual’s psychological state. This is also why the perception and quality of vision and hearing are important predictors of Being away in the PRS. Indicators of psychological restoration other than Being away are influenced by multiple sensory patterns. This aligns with the findings of Hedblom et al. in their multi-sensory experience experiments in virtual natural environments [\n53\n] and Tate Sensorium [\n86\n] in a virtual environment and the research conclusions of Yildirim et al. in workplace settings [\n87\n]. These studies suggest that a multi-sensory experience plays a significant role in mental health, and that adding sound, taste, tactility, and smell to visual stimuli can help reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. SVS scores are mainly influenced by sensory inputs other than vision, further reinforcing the importance of multi-sensory integration. This also highlights the necessity of considering non-visual factors in future urban planning and design [\n88\n].\n4.3. Research Significance and Action Implications\nThis study explored the role of sensory experiences in the environment as a crucial component of its psychological restorative functions, highlighting its significant research value.\nTheoretically, this study analysed sensory experiences through the dimensions of perception, quality, and variety and proposed sensory indicators and their effects on stress reduction, vitality restoration, and attention recovery, thereby filling a gap in the existing literature.\nPractically, first, the findings suggest that future urban planning and design should prioritize the creation of different spaces that adapt to different intervention modes and consider human visual attention and perception mechanisms when arranging pathways and seating areas [\n81\n,\n82\n,\n83\n], catering to the visual habits of individuals in urban spaces, such as focusing on stationary and immediate objects while walking and having an expanded field of view to capture dynamic moments when sitting. This includes designing smooth, coherent path systems for walkers, incorporating multi-sensory experiences at key points, and providing open views and dynamic visual elements in seating areas to enhance sensory experiences and psychological restoration. Second, this study advises urban planners and landscape designers to avoid overcrowding spaces with excessive design elements, because, based on this research, rich but low-quality landscapes are not necessarily pleasant and low-quality landscape design elements are often closely related to artificial elements (e.g., vehicles, streets, construction, and buildings, as well as vehicle and construction noises). Therefore, planners and designers should appropriately incorporate artificial elements into natural elements to decrease and balance the negative impact of artificial features through strategic layout, the use of sound barriers, or natural barriers (e.g., hedges, vegetation strips), even improving the perceived quality by increasing the rate of visual greenery in urban spaces with a high proportion of artificial elements. These approaches foster a more comfortable and harmonious connection between individuals and their environments. Third, future designs should place greater emphasis on the importance of multi-sensory experiences, especially smell and tactile experiences, which can be achieved through the introduction of aromatic plants and the creation of a varied tactile environment (e.g., diverse paving materials), thus enhancing the immersion and psychological recovery effect of the space.\nSocially, this study’s findings provide specific recommendations for urban and landscape planners, aiding in the practical enhancement of the health benefits of urban spaces, improving residents’ quality of life, and increasing their happiness and satisfaction. These improvements could contribute to reducing suicide rates [\n89\n], increasing community cohesion [\n4\n], lowering crime rates [\n90\n], and promoting sustainable social development.\n4.4. Limitations\nThis study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, it focused only on visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile experiences in the environment, without considering the potential value of gustatory perception. Although gustatory input plays a minor role in human sensory perception and is rarely utilised in landscape studies [\n44\n], it is important to acknowledge that activities and food culture are often integral to spatial experiences, and taste can contribute to feelings of pleasure and relaxation [\n91\n]. Second, the effect of exposure time on psychological restoration requires further investigation. Ann et al. found that spending more than 15 min in a natural environment significantly enhances vitality [\n92\n]. Therefore, future studies should explore whether longer periods of activity or sitting result in different psychological restoration outcomes. Third, this study’s sample size was limited, which may restrict the generalisability of its findings to a broader target population. Although we attempted to control for factors such as gender, age, and occupation when recruiting participants, this study was limited to a sample of university students, which constrains the applicability of the conclusions. Fourth, owing to cost and time constraints, this study selected only portions of urban streets, community gardens, and botanical gardens to represent the BE, SGS, and NGS urban space types, respectively. This selection may have introduced some bias. Future research should include experiments in additional green spaces within these three urban space types to supplement the current findings. Finally, beyond clarifying the differences in sensory experiences and psychological restoration across different urban environments and identifying the types and dimensions of sensory experiences that influence the effectiveness of spatial psychological restoration, future research should also aim to quantify the dimensional parameters of various sensory experiences through further experiments. This would provide valuable references for landscape design and planning.\n5. Conclusions\nUrban green spaces are a crucial component of green infrastructure in cities, significantly affecting the urban ecological environment and psychological health of residents. The development of different types of urban spaces is a key focus for urban planners and policymakers. This study adopted a multi-sensory perspective to examine sensory experience characteristics, restorative benefits, and their interrelationships in an urban BE, SGS, and NGS, providing valuable recommendations for urban green space development. In terms of sensory experiences and psychological restorative functions, the NGS, which is characterised by high vegetation coverage and the dense presence of natural elements, demonstrated stronger restorative effects, followed by the SGS. This study also drew on the strengths and limitations of the existing literature by conducting a more detailed analysis of each sensory modality using the indicators of perception, quality, and variety. This revealed the potential connections between sensory experiences and psychological health restoration, offering new insights into how sensory landscapes can be more precisely utilised to create effective urban healing spaces. Multi-sensory experiences in urban spaces are a promising area for further research. The roles of different sensory dimensions across various space types and population groups should be explored through additional experiments to obtain quantitative metrics. Additionally, future studies should incorporate objective physiological indicators (e.g., blood pressure, oxygen levels, skin conductance, and cortisol levels) for more in-depth mechanistic research, thereby supporting future planning and design efforts.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualisation, S.Q. and R.M.; methodology, S.Q. and R.M.; software, S.Q.; formal analysis, S.Q.; investigation, S.Q.; data curation, S.Q.; writing—original draft preparation, S.Q.; writing—review and editing, R.M.; visualisation, S.Q.; supervision, R.M.; project administration, S.Q.

It is located near the foothills of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas in Northwest India and is independent India’s first planned. Planning along the lines of Garden City concept, Le Corbusier envisioned the periphery to be a large green space whose agriculture would support the city and the city in turn would generate employment for the local people. In the last four decades, the towns of Panchkula and Mohali have grown around Chandigarh not only in terms of population but have spread in area too turning it into a vast and economically vibrant region. Even though the green cover within the city limits of Chandigarh have been maintained, the rapid urbanisation of the periphery especially since after 2008 has been impacting the periphery area.\nClimate change and increasing urbanization will exacerbate the temperatures in the urban areas creating heat islands. Green spaces can play a significant role in the complex urban ecosystems. Green spaces in urban areas in form of parks, green roofs and walls and road-side trees can reduce the temperature.\nSmartness of a space lies in its aesthetics and attractiveness, healthy environment, ability to create social cohesion and economic viability. These spaces benefit the communities directly and indirectly from aesthetics, environment, recreation and economic standpoints. At the same time urban areas can accrue the benefits of mitigating air pollution and revive the fast depleting biodiversity habitats.\n2\nEvolution of Chandigarh and Its Region\nChandigarh derives its name from the temple of Goddess ‘Chandi’\nFootnote\n1\nand ‘garh’\nFootnote\n2\nthat lay beyond the temple. The gently sloping plains where present day city of Chandigarh exists, was in the ancient past, a wide lake ringed by a marsh [\n3\n]. The fossil remains found at the site indicate a large variety of aquatic and amphibian life. The area was also known to be a home to the Harappans during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Since the medieval through modern era, the area was part of the large and prosperous Punjab Province, which was divided into East and West Punjab during partition of the country in 1947. Established immediately after Independence, the city was conceived not only to serve as the capital of Punjab, but also to resettle thousands of refugees who had been uprooted from West Punjab (in present day Pakistan) [\n3\n].\nIn March 1948, the Government of the then erstwhile Punjab, in consultation with the Government of India, approved a 114.59 km\n2\n(11,459 ha) area at the foothills of Shivaliks as the site for the new capital. The site selected by Dr. M. S. Randhawa, the then Deputy Commissioner of Ambala was a part of the erstwhile Ambala district as per the 1892–93 Gazetteer of District Ambala [\n4\n]. Chandigarh was designed for a population of five lakhs and density of approximately 4400 persons per Sq. km (44 persons per hectare) [\n5\n]. Subsequently, with the reorganization of the erstwhile State of Punjab in 1966 into present day Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, the city of Chandigarh assumed the unique distinction of being the capital of two states, Punjab and Haryana. The city was declared as a Union Territory and put under the direct administrative control of the Central Government.\nChandigarh is symbolic as the first city that was planned in independent India. Planned on modernist thinking,\nFootnote\n3\nthe then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned the new city to represent free India. Albert Meyer, an American planner and architect, was hired in 1949 to formulate the plan of Chandigarh city. Mayer developed a superblock\nFootnote\n4\nbased-city threaded with green spaces which emphasized the cellular neighborhood and traffic segregation. The site had certain inherent landscape feature, which were fully retained as well as integrated into the plan like the gentle grade was used to promote the drainage and rivers to orient the plan [\n8\n] (Refer Fig.\n1\n).\nFig. 1\nSource\nMayer [\n9\n]\nChandigarh city plan by Albert Mayer.\nFull size image\nThe natural features of the site consisted of the panoramic range of the Shivalik Hills, the gently sloping land form from the North-East to the South-West, seasonal rivulets on its north-western and south-eastern flanks; and an eroded valley with a small nallah\nFootnote\n5\nrunning through the centre [\n8\n].\nThe conceptual design was further detailed by young architect, Mathew Nowicki in Mayer’s team, who gave it a touch of artistry and monumentality as he synthesised it into a simple pattern ‘The leaf’, bringing in the element of sensitization towards the environment and ecology from the inception into the plan (Refer Fig.\n2\n).\nFig. 2\nSource\nMayer [\n9\n]\nThe ‘leaf plan’ of Chandigarh conceptualised by Mathew Novicki.\nFull size image\nDue to untimely death of the Nowicki, Le Corbusier, a swiss-french architect and urban planner, was appointed to complete the design for the capital city. He had a repute of being the forefather of the Modernist architectural. Corbusier’s approach to planning was to create a scientifically rational and comprehensive solution to urban problems in a way that would both promote democracy and quality of life [\n11\n]. Based on the principles of scientific rationalism, efficiency, and social improvement through design, new ideas of mass production and democracy inspired his vision of the built environment. These manifested in planning and architecture through the use of minimal ornamentation, repetitive units, high rise structures, and separation of land use and zoning.\nCity plan was modified from one with a curving road network to rectangular shape with a grid iron pattern for the fast traffic roads, besides reducing its area for reason of economy. The city plan was conceived as post war Garden City\nFootnote\n6\nwherein vertical and high rise buildings were ruled out, keeping in view the socio economic-conditions and living habits of the people.\nThe city was conceptualized as an urban organism with its major functions: living, working, care of the body and spirit and circulation, being equated with different parts of human body. Neighborhood called a sector was rectangular in shape of about one square kilometer each which defined its basic unit. Le Corbusier planned the Capitol Complex at the top of Chandigarh city resembling the head; the intellectual base, reflecting his conviction that governance should begin here as the head rules the body. Residential sector constituted the living part whereas the Capitol Complex, city centre, Educational Zone (Post Graduate Institute, Punjab Engineering College and Punjab University) and the Industrial Area constitute the working part. The Leisure Valley, Gardens, Sector Greens and Open Courtyards were designed to represent the care of body and spirit. The circulation system comprised of 7 different types of roads known as 7 Vs. Subsequently, pathways for cyclists called V8 were added to the circulation system [\n8\n]. Combining modernity with ecology, 8 km long linear-park was planned running through the city from its north eastern tip to its south-western end forming the city level urban green.\nCorbusier’s design of an integrated system of seven roads was to ensure efficient traffic circulation. The city’s vertical roads run northeast/southwest known in local language as ‘path’ and the horizontal roads run northwest/southeast known as ‘marg’. These intersect at right angles, forming a grid of network for movement. This arrangement of road-use has led to a hierarchy of movement, which also ensures that the residential areas are segregated from the noise and pollution of traffic [\n8\n].\nThe work place of the city, the industrial area comprised of 2.35 km\n2\n, is located in the extreme southeastern side near the railway line. The location of the industrial areas was in conjunction with the prevalent wind direction of the area, which is north, north west. The area has been allocated and planned for non-polluting and light industry and is directly connected to the civic centre by a V-3 road. A wide buffer of fruit trees has been planted to screen off the industrial area from the rest of the city. Tree plantation and landscaping has been an integral part of the city’s Plan. Twenty-six different types of flowering and twenty-two species of evergreen trees [\n3\n] all over the city help to ameliorate the harsh climate of the region, especially the hot and scorching summers.\n3\nNatural Conditions of Chandigarh\nChandigarh experiences cold dry winder, hot summer and sub-tropical monsoon. Evaporation usually exceeds precipitation and the weather is generally dry. The city experiences four seasons: summer or hot season from mid-March to mid-June, rainy season from late June to mid-September, post monsoon Autumn from mid-September to mid-November and winter from mid-November to mid-March. The dry spell of summer is long but with occasional drizzles and thunderstorms. May and June are the hottest months of the year with mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures being about 40 and 25 °C, respectively. Southwest monsoons bring high intensity showers in late June and July. The weather at that time is hot and humid. January is the coldest month with mean maximum and minimum temperatures being around 24 and 1.8 °C respectively [\n13\n].\n3.1\nTemperature\nThe hot season lasts for two and a half months, from April end to beginning of July, with an average daily high temperature above 36 °C. The hottest days of the year are in May, with an average high of 41 °C and low of 27 °C.\nThe cool season too lasts for two and a half months, from December to middle of February, with an average daily high temperature below 23 °C. The coldest days of the year are in January, with an average low of 8 °C and high of 20 °C [\n13\n].\n3.2\nClouds\nThe average percentage of cloud cover, that is the sky covered by clouds, in Chandigarh varies significantly by season. The clearer part of the year in begins towards the end of August and lasts for about three and a half months until middle of December. The month of September experiences the clearest skies. The cloudier part of the year begins around middle of December and lasts for about eight and a half months. The month of July is the cloudiest day of the year.\n3.3\nPrecipitation\nA wet day is one with at least one millimeter of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. The chance of wet days in Chandigarh varies very significantly throughout the year. The wetter season lasts three months, from middle of June to middle September. The wettest month being July. The drier season lasts nine months, from middle of September to middle of June, November being the driest month.\n3.4\nRainfall\nChandigarh experiences extreme seasonal variation in monthly rainfall. The rainy period of the year lasts for 10 months, from middle of December to middle of October. Most rainfall is during July and August, averaging at 220 mm. The rainless period of the year lasts for two months, from middle of October to middle of December. The least rain falls in November, with an average total accumulation of 5 mm [\n8\n].\n3.5\nSun\nThe length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year in Chandigarh. The shortest day and the longest day coincides with the winter and summer solstice. Summer solstice giving the region the long daylight time of 14 h and winter solstice giving the shortest daylight time of only 10 h.\n3.6\nHumidity\nChandigarh experiences extreme seasonal variation in the perceived humidity. The comfort level of humidity is dependent on the dew point, determined by the evaporation of the perspiration from the skin. Lower dew point feels drier and higher dew point feels humid. The humid period of the year lasts about three and a half months from middle of June to beginning of October, August being the most humid.\n3.7\nWind\nThe average hourly wind speed in the city experiences significant seasonal variation. The windier period is from middle of January to end of June with average wind speed of 10 km per hour. The calmer month experience about 6 km per hour of wind speed [\n8\n].\nThe predominant wind direction is north and northwest. Seven months of the year experience the north wind and three months experience the west wind.\n3.8\nTopography\nChandigarh lies at an elevation of 1053 feet (321 m) above mean sea level. The topography within 3 km has modest variations in elevation with maximum elevation change of 50 m. This change within 15 km is about 100 m. This variation is significant within 100 km at about 3000 m.\n90% of the area within 3 km of Chandigarh is covered in artificial surface, within 10 km is 65% of the area is under agricultural land and 20% under artificial surface. This increases to 76% under agricultural land and 12% under trees within 100 km [\n8\n,\n13\n].\nWhile planning the city of Chandigarh, the natural and climatic conditions of the region have been accounted for. The placement of the principal functions has been based on the climatic conditions and the gradient of the land, like the industries have been located considering the prevalent wind direction. The alignment of the roads, which is in the grid form is in conjunction with the prevalent wind direction as well.\n4\nLand Use Through the Development Plans\nThe economic constraints led the master plan to be implemented in two phases, catering to a total population of half a million (five lakhs). Phase-I consisting of 30 low density sector spread over an area of 36.42 km\n2\n(Sector 1–30) for 150,000 people whereas Phase-II consisting of 17 considerably high density sectors (Sectors 31–47) spread over an area of 24.28 km\n2\nfor a population of 350,000 [\n8\n].\nChandigarh city is under the administration of Union Territory of Chandigarh. The planning functions of the city are undertaken by the Urban Planning Department and the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh manages the provision and maintenance of services and amenities within the municipal area.\nThe area of the Municipal Corporation is 79.74 km\n2\nout of 114 km\n2\n[\n14\n]. With regards the existing land use (including the extension areas of the city) about 38% of area is categorized as residential and 5% as commercial and a significant 8% each is assigned towards forests. On the other hand, the proportion of public and semi-public use land constitutes 11% and transportation land constitutes only 7% of the total area (Table\n1\n).\nTable 1 Existing and proposed land use classification, 2014 and 2031\nFull size table\nWhile planning the city of Chandigarh, every emphasis has been laid for providing green spaces, throughout the city. The open space per capita in the city was 82 m\n2\nin the early stages of development [\n8\n] With the subsequent increase in population, the per capita green spaces in the city came down to 56 m\n2\nin 2010, which is still quite high as compared to 21.43 m\n2\nper capita in the Delhi. Whereas, in Gandhinagar, another post-independence planned city of India the green cover is 164 m\n2\nper capita [\n15\n]. In the new cities that have been recently planned, Naya Raipur and Amravati, the green cover has been designated at 27 and 53% of the total area [\n15\n].\nThe city of Chandigarh was planned with the city at the core and agricultural area in the periphery. In order to enforce the vision of the Plan, Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act was enacted in 1952 to ensure that no haphazard development in the periphery of the planned city.\n5\nChandigarh Periphery Control Act\nHoward Ebenezer, in his model of Garden City, attempted to plan for both the town and country. The agricultural green belt was an essential element of the Garden City concept. Realizing that development is continuous, Ebenezer also envisioned satellite cities developing around a central city. The satellite cities were contained cities with their own green belts. He advocated the idea of ensuring the continuity of the rural green character of the countryside around the urban, grey landscape of a city despite controlled developments. His ideas found form in the shape of the Greater London plan of 1944 which provided for a green belt of 8 km all around the city to contain the sprawl of London [\n12\n].\nPlanning along the same lines so as to maintain the aesthetic of the new City, Le Corbusier envisioned the periphery to be a large green space whose agriculture would support the city. He emphasized that the agriculture on the periphery would support the city and the city in turn would generate employment for the local people (Fig.\n3\n).\nFig. 3\nSource\nHoward [\n16\n]\nThe Garden City concept.\nFull size image\nThe city of Chandigarh as planned was spread over 114 km\n2\n. The city that formed the core was to be surrounded by agriculturally dominant area spread over 1500 km\n2\n. This was a 16 km buffer extending from the outer boundary of the area acquired for Chandigarh (Refer Fig.\n4\n).\nFig. 4\nSource\nDeveloped by authors from Chandigarh Master plan 2031\nChandigarh capital periphery boundary.\nFull size image\n5.1\nThe Act\nIn order to enforce the implementation of the vision of an agriculturally dominant periphery, the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 popularly known as the Chandigarh Periphery Controlled Act was established in 1952. Its objective was to prevent mushrooming of unplanned construction around the new city. The Periphery Control Act was created to regulate the use of land and prevent unauthorized urbanization within 8 km. A controlled periphery around the new capital was proposed to serve as much as a green envelope, as a buffer separating the new capital from the indigenous urban expression all around [\n17\n].\n5.2\nThe Purpose\nAt the time of conceptualization, the rationale of the said Act was to protect the surrounding rural community from getting urbanised, to prevent the growth of slum like inhabitations, to freeze the land use in the demarcated boundary, and to stop conversion of agricultural\nFootnote\n7\nland into uses other than agriculture or subservient to agriculture [\n17\n]. Another purpose of the Periphery was to provide locally available building material (from brick kilns) for the construction of the city [\n17\n].\n5.3\nViolations to the Act\nHowever, there emerged gaps between what was visualized and what came up as the Chandigarh grew. Development is largely guided by the political and economic factors that are highly unpredictable and dynamic in nature. The time gap between planning and development leads to unforeseen realities which has been the case of Chandigarh and its Periphery.\nViolation to The Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 started in 1962 with the establishment of Army Cantonment at Chandimandir, Air Force Station and Hindustan Machine Tools factory within the periphery. In the same year, the periphery control area was extended from 8 to 16 km through an amendment to the Act. These establishments were considered essential and were not deemed to be violations of the Act as such.\nIn 1966 the state of Punjab was divided into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Chandigarh continued to be the capital of the states of Haryana and Punjab and was made the Union Territory under the direct administrative control of the central government. The Union Territory of Chandigarh comprised of 114 km\n2\n, 70 km\n2\nunder the city limits and 44 km\n2\nin the Periphery area. 1021 km\n2\nof the periphery area came under Punjab and 295 km\n2\nunder Haryana. At the time of state reorganisation, in 1966, only 3% of the controlled area came under Chandigarh, 23% went with Haryana and 74% fell under Punjab control. It had a population of 1.04 million in 2001 spread across 458 villages and 12 urban centres [\n5\n].\nSoon after the reorganization of the states, townships were established by respective state governments in areas adjoining Chandigarh. The state of Punjab set up a 22 km\n2\ntown of Mohali towards south west while Government of Haryana set up a 20 km\n2\nurban area of Panchkula towards south east. The establishment of these towns was in violation to the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952. The towns of Mohali and Panchkula have over the years developed a unique relation with Chandigarh city at the core. Panchkula bordering Chandigarh on the southeast functioned as a big service center. In Mohali, industrial impetus was given which has led to the growth of present day town spread across 22 km\n2\n.\nIn 1975, a high powered co-ordination committee was constituted under the then Ministry of Urban Development which in 1977 led to the formulation of Chandigarh Urban Complex Plan consisting of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula comprising of 330 km\n2\n. The three cities are popularly known as Tri-City.\nIn 1984, Chandigarh Interstate Regional Plan was prepared by Town and Country Planning Organisation, New Delhi for an area of 2431 km\n2\nfor a population of 25 lakhs [\n8\n] (Refer Fig.\n5\n).\nFig. 5\nSource\nDeveloped by authors with inputs from Chandigarh Interstate Regional Plan\nSpatial spread of Chandigarh metropolitan region.\nFull size image\nIn 1990, Punjab Government declared an area of 40 km\n2\nto be a Free Enterprise Zone (FEZ) in Dera Bassi Tehsil of Patiala District [\n18\n] (now part of SAS Nagar District), where the setting up of industries was to be permitted. This further undermined the power of the Periphery Act.\nIn 1998, Punjab Government decided to pass a regulation for an over-arching regularization of all existing unauthorized constructions, as well as permitting the future construction of educational and health institutions [\n19\n]. This move by the government resulted in mushrooming of educational institutes on the outskirts of the urban area along the main roads and highways. The states of Punjab and Haryana had themselves violated the green buffer the by developing the townships of Panchkula, Mohali and Zirakpur. In 1999, Chandigarh Interstate Metropolitan Regional Plan was to be prepared for a 50 km radii [\n8\n].\nIn order to capitalise on the new wave of urbanisation, especially in the tier II and III towns, the Government of Punjab notified Greater Mohali Area Development Authority Regional Plan 2056 covering an area of 1021 km\n2\nwhich is the periphery area of Chandigarh falling within the jurisdiction of Punjab. Subsequently, Haryana government added approximately 6 km\n2\nof area to Panchkula Development Plan [\n8\n,\n20\n].\nThere have been numerous violations to the Act. In the last four decades, the towns of Panchkula and Mohali have grown around Chandigarh not only in terms of population but have spread in area too turning it into a vast and economically vibrant region. These developments by the state government took place in the city’s greenbelt, an area under green activities like agriculture and trees. The controlled area gradually became uncontrolled. Punjab and Haryana governments instead of protecting the green belt established satellite towns adjacent to Chandigarh to benefit from the economic opportunities provided by it. The Periphery Control Act which was notified in order to ensure the sustainability of rural landscape around Chandigarh, due to economic and developmental pressures failed to do so. Increasing urbanization and sprawl impacted the environment of the region.\n6\nGreen Spaces in Urban Area\nUrban green space is a component of ‘green infrastructure’, that comprises of all urban land covered by vegetation of any kind. This covers vegetation on private and public grounds, irrespective of size and function, and can also include small water bodies such as ponds, lakes or streams which are known as the ‘blue spaces’ [\n21\n]. In the context of Chandigarh, all of the area within the Periphery Boundary as per the Punjab Capital Periphery Control Act. 1952 is being considered as the study area, hence includes the area under agricultural activities as Green Space.\nGreen spaces in cities are considered a crucial factor for realizing environmental quality goals, which are within the SDG Goal 11 of making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. A target of the Goal is to provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities [\n22\n]. The SDGs have been formulated very recently, in 2016. The importance of Green Spaces in and around the city which emanated from the need of improving the health and providing better housing conditions during the industrial era, has been realized a s a prerequisite by the Planners from the most initial stages.\n6.1\nBenefits of Green Spaces\nBenefits of Green Spaces are numerous. Direct benefits of green spaces are reduction in energy consumption, ground water recharge, protection of lakes and streams from polluted runoff, reduced soil erosion, rainfall retention, water quality protection, reduced heat island effect and lesser overall temperatures.\nAn indirect benefit of urban green areas is a decrease in the crime rates of the area which has been substantiated by a study conducted in Philadelphia where it was found that areas where grass, trees and shrubs were found, crime rates, especially robberies and assaults were lesser [\n23\n]. This has been corroborated by another study that the presence of large street trees was most important in reducing rates of crime [\n24\n]. Green cover in an area is an indicator of the neighborhood being cared for and hence creating a perception in the mind of the criminal that he may be watched.\nIt has been observed by the UW-Madison Department of Urban and Regional Planning [\n25\n] that the urban green spaces are helping in regulating the climate and air quality as well as reducing the energy consumption and in turn are recharging the groundwater. Wolf observed in 2004 that the trees in a parking lot can reduce on-site heat buildup, decrease runoff and enhance night time cool downs. Tests in a mall parking lot in Huntsville, Alabama showed a 31° difference between shaded and unshaded areas. There are evidences that green cover modifies temperatures and in turn reduces the amount of fossil fuel used for cooling and heating. Properly placed deciduous trees reduce house temperatures in the summer, allowing air conditioning units to run 2–4% more efficiently [\n26\n].\n6.1.1\nRooftop Green Spaces Reduce Urban Heat Island Effect\nThe urban heat island effect is a term used to describe the hotter temperatures found in cities compared to rural areas within the same region. Human activities increase the temperature within cities, and with a reduction in greenery there is little natural cooling. An excellent way to combat this is to turn rooftops into green spaces or green/living roofs. Planted roofs are exceptionally effective at reducing environmental heat as well as provide greater energy-efficiency within the building itself.\n6.1.2\nGreater Energy Conservation\nNot only does an increase in green space directly affect the building it surrounds or is on (in the case of green roofs), but they also contribute to energy conservation to the city as whole. By reducing temperatures naturally and helping to bring down air temperature, buildings’ HVAC systems can run at a slightly lower power. This is especially true for residential neighborhoods which may see up to a 4% increase in AC efficiency when trees are properly planted to block sunlight in the hottest parts of the day [\n27\n].\n6.1.3\nNatural Reduction in Noise Pollution\nNoise pollution in the form of nearby industrial buildings or busy roads and highways can naturally be buffered by green spaces. Strategic planting of shrubs and trees are a way to not only enhance the surrounding areas but also help protect people from unpleasant, disruptive noise.\nEnclosed green spaces may not actually be such a bad idea, especially for green spaces around office buildings where the area functions as a place for employees to relax. Noise pollution in densely populated areas within a city can be quieted by the use of insulated concrete walls surrounding green spaces, even if only as a single wall barrier alongside a busy highway adjacent to the space [\n27\n].\n6.1.4\nImproved Air Quality\nAir pollution is a serious issue in many big cities that are densely populated. It is fairly common knowledge that plants clean the air, a primary reason why so many homeowners enjoy their houseplants. On a larger scale, green spaces with trees and shrubs are an ideal way of naturally cleansing the air.\n6.1.5\nErosion and Runoff Control\nWater and wind erosion cause sediment to seep into bodies of water, storm drains, and roads. When erosion occurs in an urban setting it can easily lead to flooding, mudslides, and dust storms. A densely planted green space is the natural way of reducing erosion. A well-planted green space will also help prevent nutrient loss in the soil, which can still occur in poorly planted spaces.\n6.1.6\nPromotes a More Active Lifestyle\nNumerous studies have concluded that access to more green space also increases the population’s activity level. A major factor in the struggle of obesity is regular exercise, a problem only made worse within cities with little access to parks and similar open spaces. Simple observational research shows people living in greener areas are more active. This is especially true for children, as majority of the physical activity in childhood outside of the school playground is in parks [\n27\n].\n6.1.7\nEffectively Helps Prevent Disease and Ease Mental Illness Symptoms\nNot only does being in a green space help with the healing process, both physically and mentally, but it also works towards preventing diseases like Alzheimer’s and Dementia. It comes as no surprise that more and more hospitals and similar healthcare buildings are creating “healing gardens”, green spaces where patients can visit and relax. Green spaces also help with mental conditions like ADHD (particularly in children) as well as insomnia, depression, anxiety, and chronic stress [\n27\n].\nThere is a plethora of different benefits associated with adding more greenery to cities. As the concern over climate change and human adaption to these changes continues, the practice of bringing more of nature back into our urban areas is need of the hour. Empirical studies indicate multiple approach towards green Infrastructure (Table\n2\n).\nTable 2 Infrastructure approaches to environmental sustainability\nFull size table\n6.2\nUrban Green Spaces Around the World\nThere are a number of cities around the world which have shown that planning of urban areas can be environment friendly. The most livable cities are as known for their open space, have a large core area as open green public space. Hyde Park in London, Central Park in New York, the Bukit Timah Nature Preserve in Singapore, Phoenix Park in Dublin are some such examples functioning as the lungs of the cities. Curitiba, a Brazilian city of a population of 1.8 million people consumes 23% less fuel per capita than the Brazilian national average. The city has 16 parks, 14 forests, and over 1000 green public areas shared by its residents [\n28\n].\nIndian examples are Sanjay Gandhi Van in Mumbai, The Ridge in Delhi, and Nandan Van in Naya Raipur apart from cities of Bangalore, Gandhinagar and Jaipur.\n6.2.1\nSan Diego Forward: The Regional Plan (2019–2050)\nThe goals of the Regional Plan of San Diego are to provide innovative mobility choices and planning to support a sustainable and healthy region, a vibrant economy, and an outstanding quality of life for all. The Regional Plan identified smart growth and sustainable development as important strategies to direct the region’s future growth toward compact, mixed-use development in urbanized communities that already have existing and planned infrastructure, and then connecting those communities with a variety of transportation choices. In 2008, the San Diego region included about 3.1 million people forecasted to increase by 1.25 million people by 2050 [\n30\n].\nThe San Diego region has made significant changes in the approach to planning in planning for more compact, higher density, and walkable development in order to protect the open spaces in the region. The natural environment in the San Diego region includes three general geographic areas: the coast, the mountains, and the desert (Fig.\n6\n).\nFig. 6\nSource\nRegional plan SANDAG [\n30\n]\nProposed land use 2020 San Diego region.\nFull size image\nThe San Diego Region open space strategy has been developed on the principles of sustainability and smart growth. The Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) land use pattern also protects and preserves about 1.3 million acres of land, more than half the region’s land area. SANDAG has defined regionally significant open space to include: region-defining open space, natural resource areas, region-serving open space, and rural lands [\n30\n]. These areas include parks, steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands, and habitat of native plants and animals.\nRegion-serving open space are areas lightly developed with activities or facilities that serve the region as unique or outstanding recreational, safety or managed production (agriculture, mineral extraction). These areas are retained as open space and, in some cases, increased to serve the region’s expanding needs. Additionally, corridors of open space within and between communities are retained in order to provide identity and a sense of community, and to link significant open space areas.\nRural lands are areas outside the identified urban area that are planned to remain in a low intensity, rural land use pattern. These areas provide a contrast to complete urbanization and result in the visual appearance and feeling of more openness in the region.\nThe Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP), administered by the Division of Land Resource Protection at the California Department of Conservation, produces maps and statistical data to analyse impacts to California’s agricultural resources [\n30\n]. To characterize existing and potential farmland, agricultural lands are rated according to soil quality and irrigation status FMMP maps are updated every two years using aerial photographs, a geographic information system, public review, and field reconnaissance.\nThe goal is to assure that adequate quantities of diverse habitat types are maintained, and that the plants and animals found in these habitats are less likely to become endangered. The regional habitat conservation plans in the San Diego region are designed to provide an umbrella of protection for multiple species by conserving their habitats and the linkages that allow them to travel between habitats [\n30\n].\nThe State of California has initiated a habitat conservation planning process that concentrates on the conservation of large parcels of land and emphasizes planning for environmental systems. The Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP) program pilot effort focuses on the coastal sage scrub habitat of the coastal California gnatcatcher in Southern California. The program is designed to address a habitat type of several species.\nAs part of the SANDAG participation in planning for the conservation of regional habitats, SANDAG developed a database of conserved lands in 2010 (SANDAG Conserved Lands database, 2010). This database, which is regularly updated and available to the public, serves as the basis for monitoring habitat conservation [\n30\n].\nThe SCS land use pattern incorporates finalized habitat plans as well as the conservation of other sensitive resource lands as reflected in plans by local jurisdictions. These local and regional plans ensure the conservation of plant and animal species, and natural habitats through low density zoning, conservation easements, and land purchases.\n6.3\nGreen Spaces as Per URDPFI Guidelines\nURDPFI Guidelines [\n31\n] define the open spaces as recreational spaces, organised greens and other common spaces such as vacant lands/open spaces including flood plains, forest cover in plan areas. The Guidelines prescribe 10–12 m\n2\nper person of open space. These norms are over and above the protected zones, ecological conservative areas in the hilly regions. A hierarchy of green spaces is prescribed consisting of parks, play fields, other open spaces (Refer Table\n3\n).\nTable 3 Hierarchy of open spaces\nFull size table\nIn case of Chandigarh, The Green Space have been planned at each sector level in the form of neighbourhood parks and playgrounds. There are a series of community spaces and city level parks live Rose Garden and Rock Garden. The hierarchy of services as stated in the Guidelines has been followed in case of Chandigarh.\n6.4\nGreen Spaces in Chandigarh City\nThe concept of urban green parks can be traced back to 19th century for promoting well-being in new industrialised cities. Importance of green spaces for the well-being of humans has been well established through many researches, especially after the World War II. In concurrence with thought, Corbusier kept the provision of large number of open spaces, green belts, city parks and neighborhood parks in Chandigarh right from the beginning. There exists well-structured and order in the hierarchy of open spaces in the city ranging from the neighborhood level to the city level. The major principle which guided the formulation of Chandigarh’s landscape design was that its original topography has to be retained and integrated [\n8\n]. Provision of green spaces in each sector were basically meant to provide lungs to the area and for developing areas of leisure. Unlike other Indian cities the green areas in the Chandigarh city are planned within each sector, which is the neighbourhood level (Fig.\n7\n).\nFig. 7\nSource\nChandigarh Master Plan 2031 [\n8\n]\nGreen Spaces in Chandigarh city.\nFull size image\nAdditionally, green open spaces are available either in the form of private housing, schools, colleges or other institutional large campuses such as Punjab Engineering College, Punjab University; over and above the planned green areas in the city layout, contribute as much as the overall city greenery and open spaces.\nAnother legacy of the city’s green identity is the establishment of long clear cut vistas created in the first phase of the city connecting the residents to the skyline of the hills through continuous green spaces such as sector greens, Leisure Valley and Sukhna Lake promenade. As tree plantation and landscaping has been an integral part of the city’s Master plan, the city’s green cover rose from 21% in 1991, 29.3% in 2003 to 35.7% in 2007 as per Forest Survey of India’s Report 2007 [\n33\n]. The per capita green space availability in the city presently is around 54.45 m\n2\nwhich is better than most of the European cities [\n34\n].\nThe most peculiar feature of the city’s landscaping is the tree planting along roads, open spaces, green belts and around building complexes. The road plantations were based on study of the movement of sun in relation to direction, scale, size and architecture along avenues. To minimize glare along the avenues running north-east to south-west, dense foliage evergreen trees like Ficus infectoria\nFootnote\n8\nand Schleichera oleosa\nFootnote\n9\nwere planted to form green tunnels. The shopping streets were planted with flowering species like Cassia fistula,\nFootnote\n10\nCassia javanica\nFootnote\n11\nand Jacaranda\nFootnote\n12\nspecies [\n35\n].\n6.5\nGreen Spaces in Chandigarh’s Periphery\nPrior to the siting of Chandigarh, the Periphery was characterized by an agrarian landscape of rural villages, farmland and forested areas [\n20\n]. Le Corbusier sought to maintain this functioning rural landscape by creating an agricultural greenbelt circumscribing the urban core of Chandigarh. As stated in Sect.\n6\nthe Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 was enacted soon after the preparation of the Master Plan, to help implement this vision by restricting urban development, but despite its existence, the Periphery has seen rapid land use change.\nThe landscape of the Periphery is made of four different geographical features; the Himalaya, the gravel upland (Dun), Shivalik Hills, the rolling plain at the base of the foothills (Ghar), and the Chandigarh alluvial plain [\n35\n] (Refer Fig.\n8\n).\nFig. 8\nSource\nWeber Abigail, within the edge: a revised approach to urban containment within Chandigarh periphery [\n35\n]\nNatural features in Chandigarh periphery area.\nFull size image\nEach of these features of the natural environment contributes to the rural way of life. This interconnected ecosystem has been significantly impacted by the development on the Periphery. The natural areas are at risk of depletion under the threat of urbanization, therefore impacting the rural lifestyle.\nThe majority of the Periphery is made up of Chandigarh Alluvial Plain, located at the foot of the Shivalik Hills on a gentle southwestern slope. The plains are an important feature of the Periphery as they provide fertile soil for agriculture. The Shivalik Hills are located to the northeast of Chandigarh, running parallel to the Himalayan Mountains. Patialia-Ki-Rao and Suhkna Choe are the main seasonal streams flowing through the Periphery, previously referenced in Sect.\n3\nwere defining element of the Mayer Plan.\nThere are two reserve forests functioning to protect the Sukhna Lake catchment area, which fall within portions of Punjab, Haryana and the UT. Sukhna Lake is an artificial lake located to the southwest of the Shivalik Hills. The lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna and Kansal Choes, seasonal streams flowing from the Hills [\n3\n]. This catchment area is located within portions of Punjab, Haryana and the UT. The lake was a design feature in Le Corbusier’s Master Plan of Chandigarh (Refer Fig.\n9\n).\nFig. 9\nSource\nDeveloped by authors from Survey of India Toposheet sheet and Google Map\nDrainage network of Chandigarh.\nFull size image\nRural land within the Periphery Control Area was permitted to serve one of two uses intended to meet the day to-day needs of the residents of the urban core; agriculture or the production of building materials [\n20\n]. Land was designated as ‘agricultural and afforestation zone’, or a ‘brick field zone’ which included brick and lime kilns.\nActive agriculture and the rural village remain, but as urban development encroachments have been pushed further out into the Periphery. Villages in close proximity to Chandigarh have changed significantly, becoming visibly more urban in density and commercial activities.\nThe development of the satellite towns Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab paved the way for construction to proceed within the Periphery even before Chandigarh had reached its full capacity [\n20\n]. Increasing land values in Chandigarh drove people to these neighboring townships, or further out into the Periphery where urban services were not located. Unauthorized development began emerging in response to the rapid growth and demand for services, In Punjab, the Greater Mohali Area regional plan creates seven integrated Economic Hubs, while Haryana’s regional growth strategy incorporates five planned settlements [\n3\n].\nThis trend of master planned developments has emerged over the last decade. Throughout the Periphery township development, commercial establishments, mixed-use and academic campus came up. The magnitude of land use change is evident from the study of historical and contemporary Google Earth maps (Refer Fig.\n10\n). New developments have been permitted due to relaxed interpretations of the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 and jurisdictions continuing to justify new projects in the public interest. This rapid development reflects the large-scale shift from a primarily rural Periphery of agricultural activities to a Periphery of a mixed urban land uses and activities.\nFig. 10\nSource\nDeveloped by authors using Google Earth\nTemporal comparison of built up in chandigarh periphery area.\nFull size image\nThe built up area in the Periphery Control Area increased by more than 40% over the decade between 2000 and 2012 (Refer Table\n4\n).\nTable 4 Increase in the built up in periphery control area of Chandigarh\nFull size table\nIn Punjab sub region of Chandigarh Periphery Area, nearly all of the area has been notified under the Greater Mohali Metropolitan Area Regional Plan. Even though three areas have been demarcated within the sub-region, namely Primary Urban Development Area, Secondary Urban Development Area and Agriculture/Tourism/Rural Area, the whole sub-region is likely to grow into a huge urbanized area by 2058 (Refer Fig.\n11\n).\nFig. 11\nSource\nAdapted from Greater Mohali Regional Plan 2058\nProposed urbanisation by 2058 in Punjab sub region of periphery control area.\nFull size image\nIn Haryana sub region of Chandigarh Periphery Area, the built up area has increased at nearly 50 percent decadal rate (Refer Table\n5\nand Fig.\n12\n).\nTable 5 Land cover in the Haryana sub-region of Chandigarh periphery control area\nFull size table\nFig. 12\nSource\nLand use changes in Haryana sub-region of Chandigarh controlled area: a spatio-temporal study [\n36\n]\nProposed urbanisation in haryana sub region of periphery control area.\nFull size image\nThe on-the-ground reality is that the periphery of Chandigarh is developing in a manner directly counter to the act originally intended to preserve it as a permanent, functioning agricultural greenbelt.\nThe green cover that has been declining in the Chandigarh Periphery Area due to rapid urbanisation is leaving an impact on Chandigarh. There has been a notable increase in water logging within the city as well as increase in the surface temperature of the region [\n37\n].\nChandigarh has per capita urban green space of 54.45 m\n2\n[\n34\n], having more than 35% of its geographical area under forest and tree cover, making it one of the greenest cities of India [\n3\n]. Being a planned city, the green spaces are well integrated in the master plans. Similar strategies have been adopted in the satellite towns of Panchkula and Mohali.\nChandigarh is one of the fastest growing cities in the country, with a decadal growth rate of 40.30%, has the potential to become the I.T. city of Punjab and Haryana [\n13\n]. The city is witnessing a rapid expansion, industrial boom, increased trade opportunities coupled with high population growth rate accelerated due to migration from neighboring states as well as from U.P. and Bihar. Chandigarh is beset with increasing urban environmental problems due to the growth of unsustainable economic activities, increase in vehicular transport, in spite of a public transport system. The most pertinent concerns include air and noise pollution, depleting ground water and contamination of water bodies and lakes, destruction of natural and manmade resources of cultural value and improper management of domestic and industrial effluents. This situation is leading to depletion of green cover, groundwater table and rising levels of air and noise pollution both in the core and periphery area.\nIn the periphery area the forest cover is confined to hardly 14 villages out of a total of 458, four each in Punjab and Chandigarh Sub-zones of the Periphery Zone and six in Haryana Sub-zone. Most of these villages are located along different choes\nFootnote\n13\nflowing through the Periphery Zone Forest land in Haryana Sub-zone is more than two times that of Punjab and Chandigarh Sub-zones put together. Bir Ghaggar village in Haryana recorded 98% of its total area as forest. The number of villages with more than half of their land under forest cover declined from 11 in 1971 to 4 in 2001. The actual decrease here was from 8729 to 2105 ha [\n39\n].\nMohali and Panchkula are not satellite towns in its true essence as there needs to be an essential green belt between the core town and its satellites. However, in both the cases, there is a continuum of built up with the city of Chandigarh at its core (Fig.\n13\n).\nFig. 13\nSource\nLand use changes in Haryana sub-region of Chandigarh controlled area: a spatio-temporal study [\n36\n]\nForest depleted villages.\nFull size image\n7\nChallenges for Chandigarh Periphery Region\nThe region lacks a coordinated vision for Development as well as Protecting Open Spaces. In the case of Chandigarh, while Corbusier visualised the green spaces within the city in detail, however the same consideration was not extended to the periphery region by the states of Punjab and Haryana within whose aegis the area lies.\nWatershed-scale planning is critical as environmental systems are best analysed within a watershed framework, rather than within municipal boundaries. Water logging in Chandigarh city, but also in Mohali is a result of encroachment of development on seasonal ‘choes’ in the periphery region.\nMultiplicity of governance as the state government’s efforts to go for coordinated planned development were lacking. To resolve the multiplicity of governance the Government of India constituted a Coordination Committee, in 1966 to ensure continuity in policy toward the Periphery Zone. The Coordination Committee appointed two working groups one for preparation of the Regional Plan for Chandigarh Inter-State Region and the other for the framing of requisite legislation for its effective enforcement and implementation. However, none of these could be effective in preventing development in the Periphery Area.\nStress on natural resources in the region that is the two most noticeable features in the land use change in the Periphery Zone were the decrease in the forest area and increase in the share of land not available for cultivation. The forest cover got denuded by six per cent points and land not available for cultivation’ increased by 7% points during 1971–2001. The forest cover was completely wiped away from 42 out of 50 villages where it existed in 1971. This phenomenon was more typical of the villages falling in the Punjab and Chandigarh Sub-zones. The decline in the net sown area and cultivable wasteland was marginal during 1971–2001.\nMobility challenges in form of regional transport system accentuate the issues in the region. There exist links to provide an easy access to the people living in the periphery Area to commute to the city Core.\n8\nSmart City Chandigarh\nChandigarh was selected for the Smart City project in May 2016 out of 98 cities which are under the Smart City Project of Government of India. The central idea is to make use of technology and the advanced modes of lifestyle to optimize the living conditions in the selected cities under this program.\nThe vision statement for Chandigarh Smart City has been defined as to create a Vibrant and Unique Regional Centre. The City beautiful is envisioned to become leader in livability, sustainability, equality, and innovation [\n40\n]. The city proposal is to improve public life and safety, and liveability using two initiatives:\nSmart Integrated e-Governance\nIntelligent Multi-modal command and control center\nThe administration has decided on carrying out area-based development in sectors 17, 22, 35 and 43 on a pilot basis. Under the Smart projects-Smart water meters, smart grid, wi-fi spots, intelligent traffic management system, pedestrian pavements is what all the sectors would be provided with. Apart from these, there would be smart pipes that would be connected with a wireless processor to help detect leakage in real time, with a system of online monitoring of the entire distribution in place everywhere [\n40\n].\nFootpaths and cycling tracks will also be laid on roadsides all along the inter-sector roads as well as those leading to markets to encourage people to switch over to non-motorised transport. Traffic-sensing lights or smoother flow of traffic and lesser pollution, e-surveillance with CCTV cameras and sensors at every point to help in better traffic management is being planned for the city.\nChandigarh is among four cities which the French government has identified to invest in as part of the Indian government’s smart city project and has allocated as much as two billion Euros to be spent over the next few years.\n9\nChallenges for Integrating Smart Regional Environment\nOne of the major problems facing the city is the enormous population growth both of the city and that of the adjoining areas. There is also rapid increase in the floating population, which come to work, and avail of the services in the city.\nRoot cause of Chandigarh’s problems has been that Chandigarh planning and development has been seen in isolation compared to the development of its periphery and region. While Chandigarh is a planned city its peri-urban areas are neither rural nor urban. Le Corbusier’s tool of greenbelt for Urban containment was not effective. Le Corbusier viewed the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 as a critical feature protecting his plan. In year 1966, after re-organization of state of Punjab, when Chandigarh became Union Territory (a centrally administered unit) with capital of two states of Punjab and Haryana and its periphery area got divided into three parts with majority of share going to state of Punjab and Haryana.\n10\nSmart Green Open Spaces Strategy\nIn the past few decades Chandigarh region have been seen struggling to maintain a balance between economic, environmental and social sustainability. It needs to be acknowledged that new challenges like affordable housing, economic generation have existed and dictated the current development pattern. The economic and developmental pressure is a reality, which the Punjab and Haryana Government has tried to cater to by developing new satellite towns. However, it cannot be denied that the overall vision for the region has been lacking and the development has taken place in phases due to which the green spaces in the region have been affected. The approach now, that needs to be advocated is preserving the existing green spaces in the region. This involves not developing new areas in the region that doesn’t have existing infrastructure service and preserve the open spaces in the region for ecological functions.\nThe smart green space strategy for the region should be based on the principles of growth management and green infrastructure (Refer Table\n2\n). Additionally, keeping the regional challenges in mind, the open spaces in the region should be planned and sensitive lands identified should be protected. There is a need to achieve a balance between the protection of agricultural lands and open spaces and the urban development to promotes smart and responsible growth.\nOverall strategy for open spaces needs to cover the following:\nPrepare the smart open green strategy keeping in mind the present situation and constraints\nImplement the strategy through a central authority with representatives of all involved governments and stakeholders\nAllocate responsibilities to respective state governments and local departments\nMonitor the progress against the set targets using smart tools\nReview action plan periodically\nReview and update the strategy if required.\n10.1\nChandigarh Region\nChandigarh city has been designed as greenfield city in India. The periphery of the City was visualized as buffer as a functional landscape that contains the growth of the city. However, the development of the satellite towns of Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab in Periphery area started even before Chandigarh reached its full potential of development. Increasing lands values in Chandigarh city and affordable options in the periphery drove this development. Resultantly, the rural villages in close proximity to Chandigarh have undergone significant changes. The rapid growth in the rural population can be attributed to in-migration between 1971–2001 due to economic opportunities being provided by Chandigarh city. Subsequently, Mohali and Panchkula, the satellite towns became the magnet.\nThe path of urbanisation in the region may not be reversible, however, measures can be taken by the authorities to ensure that the region is planned as a single entity maintaining the basic character and ethos of the Plan initially laid out by Le Corbusier.\nTo achieve the Green Space vision a four–point strategy has been proposed that is adopting a coordinated approach towards the planning of the Periphery and the Core; conserving and retaining the water and tree cover; adopting modern techniques of greening the region and basing the planning for the region on the principles of watershed.\nThe smart growth principles need to acknowledge the Periphery area as an integral feature of the historic master plan. Yet, at the same time the developmental pressure and sound economic opportunities for the region cannot be denied. Hence a new periphery area should be delineated keeping in mind to preserve and maintain the visualized heritage of Chandigarh. Strategies should discourage sprawl and further conversion of natural and agricultural land for urban development.\nFor meeting the development challenge two-fold approach should be adopted—one to use the existing developed area more efficiently and second to minimize the new urban centres in Chandigarh’s green belt. The periphery area needs to be visualized as an entity comprising of open spaces, agricultural lands, village settlements, urban development and planned accordingly.\n10.2\nProtection of Sensitive Lands in the Region\nA lot of effort went in selecting the site for Chandigarh city. The natural features of the selected site were incorporated in the design right from beginning. The ecological setting of the city was duly selected keeping in mind the vision for the city and the region. The landscape of the periphery comprises of distinct geographical features:\nThe Himalaya,\nShivalik Hills to the northwest that provided a backdrop, the gentle southern slope provided efficient drainage\nThe Chandigarh alluvial plain [\n35\n] at the base of the foothills\nHydrological features\nEach of these natural features plays an important ecosystem services. In the past, the infrastructural demands like road and rail transport networks, water treatment, sewage disposal, educational institutions, health centres and recreation sites have pressure on the land in the Periphery Zone thereby converting the area under cultivation, cultivable wasteland and forest, and bringing these under the urban development.\nThe seasonal water ‘choes’ in the region help in reducing runoff volumes and reduces peak flows by utilizing the natural retention and absorption capabilities of vegetation and soils. Due to development, some of them have encroached upon hampering the ecological function played by them. Conserving and retaining the water and tree cover; adopting modern techniques of greening the region and basing the planning for the region on the principles of watershed is recommended.\nThe open spaces in the region should be planned and sensitive lands identified should be protected as an integrated and connected system with different open spaces supporting one another to achieve multiple benefits. As stated by Kimmel [\n29\n], planning and decision making for vibrant and environmentally sustainable communities requires a systems perspective that integrates green and grey infrastructure. Additionally, there has to be a financing mechanism in place that funds the conservation plans and sensitive land protection in the periphery zone. Without funds and collective ownership, the area to be preserved will always face the threat of development.\nAs stated the Urban Green Areas do not have to be limited to parks on the ground but can extend to agricultural land as well as green roofs and walls. ‘Greens on Building’ that is green roofs and walls can increase the green cover specially in the core and dense urban areas with negligible land area for vegetation. These Greens in a Building not only play an important role in thermal insulation of the building itself, but also increase the water recharge and reduce runoff of precipitation into urban sewers.\nSome strategies for maintaining the green character of the region could be through adoption of smart laws that enforce ‘Greens on Buildings’ by creating green walls and roofs. The impact of this can be monitored through sensors and geospatial technology models can be generated to monitor the heat island effect. This will help the authorities in taking corrective measures to reduce the heat island effect.\n10.3\nPromote Collective Governance and Responsibility\nThe governance structure in the Chandigarh region is complex. The reorganization had negative implication for the periphery in terms of multiplicity of governance. Due to lack of interstate coordination, competing interest and differing interpretations of the language of the law, the reorganization made it particularly difficult to enforce a unified vision of the rural landscape within the Periphery [\n20\n].\nThere are multiple government in charge of different spatial segments of the region. In 1975, in response to the uncontained urban growth in the periphery the Central government formed a coordination committee for balanced development of the Chandigarh Region. Based on the recommendation of this committee, in 1984 ‘Inter State Chandigarh Regional Plan’ for 2001 was formulated. The Committee held numerous meetings and also formally obtained the comments of relevant Departments of the Government such as Revenue, Industries, Housing and Urban Development and Local Government [\n19\n]. The Committee lacked Statutory power and has remain ineffective as a result, the development taking place in periphery is lacking coordination and vision.\nGreen open space strategy cannot be separated from governance, as the process of planning involves a wide range of stakeholders and individual citizens. There is a need for emergence of a central regional authority with a vision as well as clear legal status, technical and professional capacity to plan and a robust administration to implement and enforce [\n41\n]. Additionally, not only State level coordination but there is a need to identify and support existing inter-agency and inter-municipal collaborations.\n10.4\nUse of Smart Tools Which Essentially Include Geospatial Technologies\nSmart tools which essentially include geospatial technologies encompassing remote sensing and GIS for the purpose of online monitoring of the green spaces should be incorporated in planning. It is pertinent that not only the extent of the green spaces, both in the city limits of Tri City but also in the Periphery area but also the quality be monitored and upgraded from time to time. Close monitoring. Some strategies for maintaining the green character of the region could be through adoption of smart laws that enforce ‘Green on Buildings’ by creating green walls and roofs. The impact of this can be monitored through sensors and geospatial technology models can be generated to monitor the heat island effect. This will help the authorities in taking corrective measures to reduce the heat island effect.\nIt must be noted that the city and its environs are to be considered as ecological space. The authors emphasize that Smart Green Spaces for Chandigarh and its Periphery has to be based on technology within the framework of sustainability. It is pertinent that through smart green spaces the city builds on its social capital. Planning and implementing for the smart green spaces will reduce the adverse impact of urbanization and at the same time maximize the intangible benefits and build on the aspects of culture in turn boosting the economy of the area.\n11\nConclusions\nChandigarh has been one of the most discussed city in India. It was designed to represent the modern India post-independence. However, it is important that modern urban planning should not only focus on the improvement of how a city works, but also how the open spaces or green spaces are areas within a city and the region. Realizing the number of different benefits associated with increased green spaces in urban settings will help us build healthier, vibrant and sustainable settlements.\nThe challenges that are arising in the planned city of India can be addressed through smart tools which essentially include geospatial technologies encompassing remote sensing and GIS for the purpose of online monitoring of the green spaces. It is pertinent that not only the extent of the green spaces, both in the city limits of Tri City but also in the Periphery area but also the quality be monitored and upgraded from time to time. The authors emphasize that Smart Green Spaces for Chandigarh and its Periphery has to be based on technology within the framework of sustainability. Close monitoring of these aspects will help the authorities in improving the green index and per capita ratio.\nIt must be noted that the city and its regions are to be considered as ecological space. It is pertinent that through smart green spaces the city builds on its social capital. Planning and implementing for the smart green spaces will reduce the adverse impact of urbanization and at the same time maximize the intangible benefits and build of the aspects of culture in turn boosting the economy of the area.\nNotes\n1.\nGoddess of power as per the Hindu mythology [\n1\n].\n2.\nFort [\n2\n].\n3.\nModernism in urban planning was based on the principles of clearly distinguishing everything including the four main principals of human activities: living, working, recreation so as to bring order in the city and conceive it as a machine that works according to specific rules [\n6\n].\n4.\nSuperblock is an area of urban land bounded by arterial roads that is the size of multiple typically-sized city blocks [\n7\n].\n5.\nNallah is a runnel or a brook [\n10\n].\n6.\nMethod of urban planning proposed in 1898 by Sir Ebenezer Howard in the United Kingdom were in the urban areas were planned to be self-contained communities surrounded by greenbelts, containing proportionate areas of residences, industry and agriculture [\n12\n].\n7.\nAgriculture here includes horticulture, dairy farming, poultry farming and the planting and upkeep of orchards [\n17\n].\n8.\nCommon name: white fig, locally known as p\nilkhan.\n9.\nCommon name: cylone oak, locally known as\nkusum.\n10.\nCommon name: golden shower tree, locally known as\namaltas.\n11.\nCommon name: apple blossom tree, locally known as jangli dalchini.\n12.\nCommon name: blue jacaranda, locally known as neeli gulmohar.\n13.\nSeasonal streams [\n38\n].\nReferences\nShabdkosh (2018) Meaning of Chandi.\nhttps://shabdkosh.raftaar.in\n.

Introduction\nGlobal aging represents a significant demographic trend of the 21st century. According to a National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) report, in 2022, approximately 38% of China’s total population was 50 years old or above. Moreover, a report titled “China’s Demographic Outlook to 2040 and Its Implications Projections” states that from 2015 to 2040, China’s population aged 50 and over will increase by about 2.5 billion [\n1\n]. This indicates an exceptionally rapid rate of aging in China’s population. The aging population profoundly impacts various aspects of society, economy, and environment, posing new challenges and requirements for urban planning, construction, and management. In response, China has formulated a national five-year plan aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, aiming to enhance the health and well-being of its aging population and urgently address the need for age-friendly cities and communities. This is a challenge not only for China but one that many other countries around the world are facing. Creating age-friendly urban environments that cater to the diverse needs of older adults and enhance their quality of life remains a pressing global issue [\n2\n]. Proactive measures are essential for sustainability, particularly social sustainability, to ensure the health, well-being, and environmental quality of current and future generations. Establishing supportive and inclusive environments for older adults is key to this goal and a cornerstone of sustainable city development.\nUrban parks provide residents with places for leisure, recreation, sports, and social interaction, while also serving ecological functions such as regulating the urban climate, purifying urban air, and protecting urban biodiversity [\n3\n]. Abundant evidence indicates that urban parks are important for improving the quality of life of residents as they can provide strong health benefits, social benefits, and environmental benefits [\n4\n]. Urban parks have benefits for all age groups, but they may be of more special significance for older adults. Their needs and use of urban parks may differ from other age groups [\n5\n].\nA growing challenge for older adults, especially those in one-child families, is social isolation. Older adults entering or approaching retirement, upon leaving the workplace, and as their children gain independence lose crucial spaces for interpersonal and social networking [\n6\n]. Simultaneously, these individuals face an increased risk of losing partners and friends, a risk that is higher than in younger populations [\n7\n]. This physical and psychological fear is extremely challenging for them, and the lack of social connections can lead to serious health outcomes [\n8\n,\n9\n]. The prevalence of social isolation due to a lack of social integration ranges from 7 to 17% [\n10\n]; meanwhile, approximately 40% of older adults report experiencing loneliness [\n11\n].\nAccording to the 2018 White Paper on the Mental Health of the Elderly in China, 63% of Chinese seniors frequently experience loneliness. The white paper further reveals that over 25% of Chinese older adults above 60 years of age have contemplated suicide due to physical or other varied reasons [\n12\n]. These statistics underscore the seriousness and widespread nature of mental health issues among Chinese older adults. Loneliness, often resulting from life events like retirement, widowhood, financial challenges, and interpersonal issues, is the primary cause of psychological problems among older adults, which in turn is associated with a variety of health problems or risks [\n13\n]. Face-to-face social interactions can be effective for older adults in reducing loneliness due to life changes. However, social networks tend to shrink with age, as changes in living situations and physical functioning make it difficult to maintain social ties [\n14\n,\n15\n], and widespread ageism further limits their opportunities for social interaction [\n16\n].\nQuality urban park design that meets older adults’ needs for social interaction not only boosts their quality of life but also contributes to social sustainability. Such design encourages older adults’ social interaction, reduces loneliness and isolation, and has a favorable impact on societal health and well-being. However, urban parks are underutilized for the benefit of various groups [\n17\n], a situation that deprives older adults of opportunities for social interaction.\nUrban parks, despite being among the most extensively studied green spaces, are typically linked more with physical activity than social interaction. Numerous sociologists and urban designers have examined the social roles of public spaces over time, contending that successful public spaces possess subjective qualities like supportiveness, fulfillment, and discovery [\n18\n]. Such qualities cater to fundamental needs, encompassing both passive and active participation. Moreover, frequent face-to-face contact helps to build social bonds [\n19\n]. However, the issue arises as social cohesion diminishes, leading to a widespread deficit in social interaction among residents. Despite ongoing enhancements in park quality, this trend continues, with older adults potentially being the most socially isolated group relative to other age groups [\n20\n].\nWhile urban parks are known to facilitate social interactions among older adults, limited research has been conducted on how the urban park environment contributes to these interactions [\n21\n]. Existing empirical studies primarily focus on qualitative interviews and observations of older adults’ social interactions, often overlooking the quantitative assessment of the social and physical environment’s role. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of this age group imply that findings from certain settings and subgroups may not be applicable to others. For instance, shaded seating areas have been shown to facilitate social interactions, as evidenced by studies conducted in Kuala Lumpur [\n22\n], Guangzhou [\n23\n], and Hong Kong [\n24\n]. Conversely, a study from Finland demonstrates a preference for sunlight over shade, attributed to the cooler summer temperatures prevalent in the region [\n25\n]. This preference is clearly influenced by geographic climate factors. Similarly, different types of facilities and amenities may encourage specific behaviors in various populations [\n26\n]. Consequently, questions remain about how older adults utilize urban parks and which park features support their social interactions.\n2. Literature Review\nSocio-ecological models support the importance of considering multiple layers of determinants of health behaviors (i.e., social interactions in this study), which include a range of direct or indirect factors, such as personal, social, and physical factors. This is important for this study because they attempt to capture the multiple layers of factors that may influence social interactions, allowing researchers to focus on at least one layer while recognizing confounding or interacting influences at other layers. To fill some of the knowledge gaps mentioned above, this study first explored the relationship between urban parks and social interactions and previous measures. Then, based on the theoretical framework, it examined the role of specific social and physical environments as well as personal factors in the social interactions of older adults.\n2.1. Urban Park and Social Interaction\nUrban parks, as a vital component of public open spaces, not only provide residents with opportunities for social interaction, physical activity, relaxation, and access to nature but are also important places for organized and informal activities [\n27\n], enhancing social well-being and the physical and mental health of residents [\n28\n]. Urban parks play an important role in offering social outlets and facilitating connections among individuals who might not typically interact [\n29\n]. As a result, most social activities and social interactions take place in public open spaces such as urban parks.\nSocial interaction is any contact between people, both verbal and nonverbal, resulting in a social experience, which encompasses all types of activities [\n30\n]. Interaction takes place when individuals gather with a specific purpose, and even eye contact or physical gestures when entering or exiting others’ view [\n31\n], which highlights the significance of public spaces like urban parks. Some scholars have noted that urban park environments attract, trigger, and reinforce interactional behaviors, and that such social connections may be a potential mechanism for the relationship between green spaces and health [\n32\n]. Furthermore, fostering social interactions in such environments is a cost-effective strategy to enhance health and encourage active aging [\n33\n].\nWhile interactions in public open spaces are seen by some as overly informal and random, others acknowledge their positive social impacts. This is because urban parks provide opportunities for social interactions between people of different social backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, and age groups [\n34\n]. Providing social interactions through potential spaces can be weakly occurring and one-time interactions or even long-term more structured interactions [\n35\n]. These interactions can mitigate daily life stresses and reduce community tensions [\n36\n]. Engaging in meaningful social activities, particularly in high-quality urban parks with moderate activity, can improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of older adults.\nExisting research on social interaction predominantly assesses objective aspects of social interaction, including frequency of neighborhood interactions [\n37\n,\n38\n], number of social contacts [\n39\n], type of contact [\n40\n], and social network size [\n41\n]. Additionally, subjective aspects like satisfaction [\n42\n] and needs [\n43\n] have been examined. While these studies mainly focus on neighborhood interactions, there is limited knowledge about older adults’ social interactions in urban public spaces. In the context of landscape planning, few studies explore the social interactions of older adults in urban parks. For instance, Moulay et al. assessed park users’ intensity of social interaction, park contact, and interaction types via observation and questionnaire [\n17\n]. Salih et al. investigated the frequency of social activities in pocket parks using questionnaires [\n44\n]. Overall, the number of social interactions is a key indicator in evaluating older adults’ social interactions, reflecting how active older adults are in their social interactions. Some scholars note that the frequency of social interactions reflects satisfaction with these interactions and argue that, generally, increased social interactions can reduce feelings of loneliness [\n45\n]. Research indicates that 2–3 daily face-to-face social interactions can enhance mood and reduce loneliness in older adults [\n46\n], while some scholars note that increased social interaction is not necessarily beneficial, as it may not always yield positive exchanges [\n47\n]. However, regardless of the quality of socialization, it is more likely for older adults to feel positive emotions when they feel noticed and understood.\nWhile Oldenburg asserts that only verbal social interactions are effective [\n48\n], recent studies indicate that nonverbal interactions also enhance physical and mental health [\n49\n]. This form of social interaction is important for older adults to socialize because they can feel engaged in urban parks. Therefore, this study evaluates older adults’ social interactions in parks by measuring the frequency of both verbal and nonverbal face-to-face interactions.\n2.2. Factors Affecting Social Interaction in Parks\n2.2.1. Physical Factors\nMany studies have recognized that social interactions are influenced by the physical characteristics of urban public spaces. For instance, comfortable and appealing open spaces are likely to attract visitors, subsequently creating opportunities for social interaction [\n50\n]. A survey of nine parks in Mexico revealed that factors such as distance, tree abundance, safety, cleanliness, and playground quality influence users’ patterns of use, with improvements in these attributes enhancing social interaction among users [\n51\n]. An exploration of factors influencing residents’ social interactions in Australia found a positive correlation between the frequency of park use, satisfaction with resting spaces, and environmental connectivity [\n52\n]. Water features in landscapes are known to offer relaxation and stress relief to older adults, thus encouraging their visits [\n53\n]. Veitch et al. [\n54\n] identified parks as a place to promote social interactions beneficial to older adults’ health, identifying the most important park features through an online survey and joint analysis, including calm and relaxing environments, specifically shady trees, and relaxing walking paths were prioritized to encourage older adults’ visitation and social interactions. A systematic review highlighted that enhancing residents’ perception of urban green spaces boosts their usage, thereby increasing social interaction opportunities. Despite inconsistencies in the findings of some studies regarding physical characteristics, amenities, maintenance, safety, accessibility, aesthetics, and usage patterns consistently have a significant impact on social health [\n55\n]. This perspective was reinforced by a recent review, affirming that physical features, perceptions, and usage of green spaces directly influence social interactions, with factors like perceived greenness, proximity, and safety being more indicative than objective environmental measures [\n56\n].\n2.2.2. Social Factors\nThe social environment, a complex notion, encompasses the “immediate physical surroundings, social relationships, and cultural contexts” within a specific area [\n57\n]. This indicates the need to consider both social and physical environments in the study of social interactions. Yet, according to the literature review, there is a limited number of studies that specifically explore the role of the social environment in parks in enhancing social interactions.\nFrom the subjective perspective of the social environment, several studies have investigated the influence of different factors on park use and social interactions. For instance, Broyles et al. conducted surveys on social capital perceptions at 27 neighborhood parks in Los Angeles, examining trust, reciprocity norms, and common interests [\n58\n]. They found that parks with higher social capital levels experienced greater use. Otero Pena et al. analyzed individual-level park usage, with self-reported data revealing positive effects of social cohesion and trust on park usage, as well as significant correlations with parks’ physical attributes [\n59\n]. A study examining the relationship between neighborhood green spaces, social environments, and mental health in four European cities found mixed results: the correlation between green spaces and mental health varied, showing both significant and non-significant links across cities, whereas social contact consistently correlated with mental health in all four cities [\n60\n]. Meanwhile, another study explored the intergenerational and peer interactions of older adults in terms of personal, social, and physical aspects, where the social aspects investigated subjective community services, social cohesion, and perceived trust, as well as objective neighborhood age composition, and environmental attributes related to the social and physical environments were found to be key predictors [\n61\n]. Other literature reviews on the social context of park use express somewhat different views. A review integrating 21 qualitative studies found that there appeared to be reciprocal positive or negative effects between the social and physical environments, emphasizing that for women and adolescents, a safe and supportive social environment is essential for social interaction, regardless of the physical environment’s condition [\n62\n]. One study, synthesizing data from 12 studies, suggests that the combined influence of the social and physical environments enhances community engagement among older adults [\n63\n].\n2.2.3. Personal Factors\nThe literature on social interactions indicates that personal characteristics such as gender, age, and income predict social interactions. Collectively, studies on personal characteristics have shown varied results depending on location, spatial context, and subpopulation groups. For instance, one study indicated that men frequent community green spaces more than women in deprived areas [\n64\n]. Conversely, a study on the built environment’s impact on older adults’ leisure and physical activity in Nanjing found no gender-based differences in engagement levels [\n65\n]. Conflicting findings exist regarding park usage and income disparities. For instance, one study indicates that lower-income households do not utilize green spaces as actively [\n4\n,\n66\n]. Another study highlights that low-income residents have a greater need for public green space activities than wealthier residents [\n67\n]. A study investigated in China suggests that higher social capital and social trust can mitigate the decline in the well-being of older adults caused by income disparity [\n68\n]. Although numerous studies have explored how personal characteristics affect green space use, fewer have focused on older adults’ use of parks for social interaction, a notable gap given their increased risk of social isolation. Instead, a study of 34 cities around the world found that socioeconomic characteristics and their surroundings may influence health outcomes, not just the green space itself [\n69\n].\n2.2.4. Summary\nIn summary, over the past few decades, researchers concerned with public health, urban planning, and design have been trying to understand the factors that influence the relationship between health behaviors (this paper focuses on social interactions) and urban green spaces. The World Health Organization (WHO) posits that healthy aging can be fostered through an ecological approach, which influences health via the interaction of individual capabilities, home environment, community, and the broader sociocultural environment. Recently, numerous scholars have concentrated on various ecological models of aging, recognizing this approach as increasingly effective in promoting long-term health among older adults. However, few studies have investigated the impact of these factors on the use of urban parks by older adults for social interactions. This research only found a few studies examining the association between the environment and social interactions in older adults through quantitative methods. Nevertheless, these studies insufficiently considered the potential influence of a combination of personal, social, and physical environmental factors. Additionally, previous studies have yielded inconclusive results, potentially influenced by various factors such as geographic location, environment type, and user demographics. Therefore, there is a need for further investigations to clarify which factors influence the social interactions of older adults.\nIt is worth noting that the impact of park use patterns (e.g., frequency, duration, etc.) on social interactions has been proposed in many studies. Huang & Lin found that different types of urban green spaces were significantly correlated with individuals’ social health (including social connectedness, social relationships, social support, and social contact) through a review of 60 articles and noted that park use had a direct impact on social health and was influenced by both urban green space and respondents’ personal characteristics [\n58\n]. Similarly, a recent literature review analyzing 53 studies on the correlation between green spaces and social interaction also noted that the perceived physical environment has the potential to indirectly influence social interaction through patterns of use [\n56\n].\nThus, guided by these conceptual frameworks and empirical evidence, our study investigated three main factors influencing older adults’ social interactions through a questionnaire, including personal characteristics, the social environment, and the physical environment, with the addition of an investigation of park use patterns. Personal characteristics comprised gender, age, retirement status, income, and health status. The social environment involved subjective assessments of social cohesion, social support, and sense of belonging. The physical environment entailed subjective evaluations of the features, conditions, aesthetics, safety, and accessibility of urban parks. Patterns of use encompassed both the frequency and duration of usage. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between these variables and the social interactions of older adults in the context of urban parks.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Study Context\nThis study was conducted in Anyang city, Henan province, China. Anyang encompasses a land area of 7413 km\n2\nand has a population of approximately 5.41 million, located in the central region of China. As a typical medium-sized city, it boasts an urbanization rate of 54.69%, aligning with the national average, as reported in the 2021 China Census. The city’s resident population includes 1.85 million individuals aged 50 and above, constituting 34.14% of the total population [\n70\n]. Compared to the sixth national census in 2010, there has been an increase of 4.95 percentage points in the proportion of those aged 50 and above, indicative of the ongoing aging of the population in Anyang. The urban area includes four administrative districts, namely Wenfeng District, Beiguan District, Longan District, and Yindu District. Wenfeng and Beiguan Districts, having the highest residential densities, were chosen as our study sites.\nAccording to the Standard for the Classification of China’s Urban Parks (CJJ/T85-2017) [\n71\n], comprehensive urban parks are public parks that are larger and provide abundant space for a variety of recreational activities. In alignment with this study’s objectives, the selected urban parks shared these characteristics: (a) free and open public access; (b) extensive green space and numerous facilities; (c) convenient accessibility; and (d) popularity within the city’s urban areas. Six urban parks from two districts were selected for data collection, as shown in\nFigure 1\n. The selection was proportionate to the population in each district [\n72\n], leading to the choice of two parks in Beiguan District and four parks in Wenfeng District. In Beiguan District, Huanshui Park and Renmin Park were selected, while Wenfeng District included Yi Park, Shangwu Park, Sanjiaohu Park, and Honghe Park. Each park, situated near residential areas, boasts considerable green spaces and public facilities. Free access to these parks makes them vital locales for outdoor activities, particularly for older adults in surrounding neighborhoods.\n3.2. Data Collection\nData collection was conducted from June to September 2023. A mixed-method approach for questionnaire collection was employed, encompassing both on-site distribution and online collection. Prior to formal data collection, a face-to-face pretest was conducted, involving a random survey with a total of 12 respondents. The pretest primarily evaluated the questionnaire’s wording, format, and implementation process. Respondents in the pretest reported no difficulties or ambiguities in the questions. All respondents were required to read or have the informed consent form explained by the investigator, and to sign the consent form before completing the questionnaire. The eligibility criteria for the participants were as follows: (a) including older adults aged 50 years and above, in accordance with the sociologically significant criterion of old age, namely retirement age [\n73\n]; (b) excluding older adults requiring long-term care or assisted living; and (c) including older adults who were literate and capable of understanding and responding to the questions.\nIn this study, a total of 637 questionnaires were distributed, resulting in the collection of 589 valid responses, comprising 213 from field surveys and 376 via the Internet. During the field survey in the park, questionnaires were randomly distributed to older adults, and in cases of refusal, the search for a new respondent continued. The web-based questionnaire was disseminated using two methods: firstly, by setting up a link in the field and encouraging participating older adults to share it with their friends, family, or social networks; secondly, by distributing it via social media groups (WeChat) to older adults in residential areas near the park, employing a snowball sampling technique. During the on-site survey, respondents who were willing but lacked the time to complete the questionnaire in the park were provided with the link to complete it at their convenience. Data collection occurred on weekdays and weekends with favorable weather and was suspended during inclement weather, such as rain.\n3.3. Measures\n3.3.1. Social Interaction\nIn this study, social interactions were assessed primarily in terms of the number of social interactions older adults had in urban parks. The frequency of social interactions was used as a measure to determine their number. The frequency of social interactions was assessed using items adapted from a modified version of the Veitch et al. [\n54\n], Moulay & Ujang [\n74\n], and Lubben Social Networking Scale [\n75\n]. This included four items, including face-to-face verbal and nonverbal social interactions, (e.g., interactions with someone known). Responses were measured on a five-point scale (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = mostly, 5 = always). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.878.\n3.3.2. Physical, Social, and Personal Factors\nPhysical Factors. Respondents assessed their subjective perceptions of the physical characteristics of urban parks. Park characteristics were measured with reference to a framework developed by Bedimo-Rung et al. [\n4\n], and specific measurement items were based on this framework and other studies in the context of urban parks [\n76\n,\n77\n,\n78\n], as well as studies in the context of urban parks in China [\n79\n,\n80\n,\n81\n]. Factor analysis was conducted on the initial 32 items, resulting in the deletion of 2 items (parks with wildlife and parks with separate walking and running paths), as their meanings substantially diverged from the intended components. Reanalysis of the remaining 30 items through principal component analysis yielded five factors, accounting for a cumulative variance contribution of 65.77%. The KMO was 0.931, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (\np\n< 0.001). These factors were identified as features, condition, aesthetics, safety, and accessibility (\nTable 1\n). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.914.\nSocial Factors. Social factors investigated perceived social cohesion, social support, and sense of belonging. Social cohesion items refer to the Social Cohesion and Trust Scale [\n82\n]. The items for social support are mainly based on the Social Support List 12-Interaction (SSL12-I) [\n83\n]. The measure of belonging was primarily based on a scale developed by Mowe et al. [\n84\n], which assesses an individual’s sense of welcome and belonging in a park setting. This scale was further refined through modifications in several subsequent studies [\n85\n]. Each of the three dimensions contains 5 items and were measured using a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Following the factor analysis, three common factors with initial eigenvalues greater than one were established, collectively accounting for 65.14% of the variance in the original variables. The analysis yielded a KMO (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin) value of 0.909 and a significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity (\np\n< 0.001). These factors were identified as social cohesion, social support, and sense of belonging (\nTable 2\n). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.883.\nPersonal Factors. Personal factors were identified through a literature review, focusing on personal and socio-demographic characteristics, including gender, age, retirement status, income, and health status.\n3.3.3. Park Use\nPark use was defined in terms of frequency, duration, and regularity, with measurement items adapted from a validated and reliable park use questionnaire [\n86\n]. The survey comprised four items (e.g., how often do you usually visit the park? How long do you usually spend at the park?). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.854.\n3.4. Data Analysis\nStatistical analysis of this study was conducted using SPSS version 27.0. Descriptive statistics were examined, and the normality of the data distribution for each variable was assessed using skewness and kurtosis values. All predictor variables exhibited values within the ±3 range [\n87\n], indicating consistency with a normal distribution. Multicollinearity was assessed using tolerance and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values. All predictor variables were within acceptable thresholds, with tolerance levels greater than 0.30 and VIF ratios less than 4.0 [\n88\n], suggesting no significant covariance issues among the independent variables.\nThe relationship between the variables was tested by first testing the Pearson correlation analysis of the variables, and then by further constructing the hierarchical linear regression analysis model to study the mutual influence relationship between the independent variables on the dependent variables. Independent variables in this study were classified into four categories: personal factors, social factors, physical factors, and park use patterns. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted by introducing the models sequentially in the order mentioned.\n4. Results\n4.1. Descriptive Statistics\nAmong the 589 respondents, 54.2% were female and 45.8% were male. Many of the respondents were aged between 50 and 60 years (83.6%), with only 5.4% of respondents aged 65 and over. Most of the respondents had attained high school education or higher (84.2%). A total of 73% of the respondents were retired, and among the pre-retirement occupations or current occupations, there were more employees in enterprises, accounting for 47.5%, followed by employees in organizations and institutions, accounting for 30.1%. Income (CNY/month) was concentrated at the 1500–3000 level (54.7%), followed by 3000–4500 at 21.1%. The self-reported health status indicated that most of the respondents were in overall good health, with 40.7% reporting relatively good health, 36.3% fair health, and 12.7% very good health.\nTable 3\nsummarizes the descriptive statistics of this study sample.\n4.2. Correlations between Variables\nTable 4\nsummarizes the correlations between the variables of this study. The results of the correlation between the frequency of social interaction and social factors show that social cohesion (r = 0.334,\np\n< 0.01), social support (r = 0.214,\np\n< 0.01), and sense of belonging (r = 0.119,\np\n< 0.01) are all significantly and positively correlated to the dependent variable, and in the physical factors’ correlation results, features (r = 0.382,\np\n< 0.01), conditions (r = 0.312,\np\n< 0.01), aesthetics (r = 0.2,\np\n< 0.01), safety (r = 0.193,\np\n< 0.01), and accessibility (r = 0.245,\np\n< 0.01) all had significant positive correlations with the dependent variable. Furthermore, use pattern (r = 0.287,\np\n< 0.01) was also significantly positively correlated with the frequency of social interaction. These factors identified as significantly correlated were included as independent variables in further hierarchical linear regression analyses.\n4.3. Hierarchical Linear Regression Model\nTable 5\nshows the results of the hierarchical linear regression. In model 1, personal factor variables accounted for 10.8% of the variance, with gender and health status (\np\n< 0.01) significantly influencing older adults’ social interactions in urban parks. Model 2 showed that social factor variables contributed 7.9% to the variance, with perceived social cohesion and social support demonstrating statistical significance (\np\n< 0.001 and\np\n< 0.05). With the inclusion of physical factors, features, conditioning, and accessibility being significant (\np\n< 0.001,\np\n< 0.01, and\np\n< 0.01), the predictive power of model 3 further improved by 8.9%, accounting for a combined total of 27.6% of the variance in social interaction. All the independent variables in model 4 collectively explained 29.8% of the variance, with park use patterns contributing 2.2% of the variance compared to model 3. Across the model, gender, health status, social cohesion, features, condition, accessibility, and park use patterns consistently showed significant correlations with older adults’ social interactions in urban parks. Social support dropped out as a significant variable in the full model.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. The Effects of Personal, Social, Physical, and Park Use Factors on the Social Interaction of Older Adults in Urban Parks\nAmong the personal factors, gender and health status significantly affected the social interactions of older adults in urban parks, and the personal factors contributed the most to the explanation of social interactions. The model results indicate that older women exert a greater influence on social interactions than older men, and better health status in older adults correlates with a stronger positive impact on social interactions. These results are consistent with previous studies. The results of many studies suggest that compared to men, women are more inclined to engage in social interactions, especially after retirement, and they may have a more active need for social networks to maintain social connections [\n89\n]. In addition, older women are also more likely to be inclined to participate in group activities or community-organized events [\n90\n], a phenomenon that is more common in public spaces such as urban parks. Self-rated health status-based evidence suggests that good health facilitates older adults’ interactions in parks, possibly because older adults in good health have fewer physical limitations, making it easier for them to socialize with others. Furthermore, good health may also be associated with more positive attitudes toward life and socialization.\nThis study examined perceived social environment factors and found that social cohesion was significantly and positively correlated with social interactions. Social cohesion is a composite indicator of trust, mutual help, and rapport. Weijs-Perrée et al. found that social cohesion positively influences social interaction [\n45\n]. Winsor et al. also noted that it can increase comfort and support among older adults, thus promoting greater social participation [\n91\n]. Consequently, older adults perceiving fellow park users as trustworthy can lessen psychological barriers to socialization. Furthermore, a supportive atmosphere in parks might increase older adults’ propensity to engage in social activities. This could lead to more proactive behavior in seeking or offering assistance, enhancing social connections. Most of the older adults in this study are young retired older adults who are affected by social role changes and prone to negative emotions when they are alone for a long period of time, so they are in urgent need of mental comfort in the community environment. A harmonious park environment likely contributes to older adults feeling more accepted and respected, thus encouraging active participation in social interactions and fostering a sense of presence and vitality on a deeper, spiritual level.\nThis study analyzed older adults’ subjective perceptions of park features, partially reflecting their views. Among these five features (\nTable 3\n), condition received the highest rating, followed by features, accessibility, and aesthetics, with safety scoring the lowest. The findings indicate that features significantly influence older adults’ social interactions. Notably, features like seating, fitness equipment, restrooms, vegetation, and shaded areas were crucial to older adults and markedly affected their social interactions. In line with existing research, extensive studies in the literature underscore the profound effect of vegetation on diverse social processes [\n92\n,\n93\n,\n94\n]. Trees and grassy spaces are believed to foster increased participation, thereby enhancing the likelihood of informal social interactions [\n95\n]. Additionally, parks should offer essential amenities, including adequate shade, exercise equipment, seating, and restrooms, to encourage older adults’ active engagement in social interactions [\n21\n].\nGood conditions have potential implications for supporting social interactions. Some studies point to poorly maintained paths as a major barrier to park use for older adults [\n96\n,\n97\n]. The absence of noise and uncivilized behavior positively affect older adults’ social interactions, and noise such as road traffic has been reported to have less of an impact on people when surrounded by greenery [\n98\n,\n99\n]. Contrary to visitors who find sounds like children playing, square dancing, and musical instruments disruptive, older adults in this study did not perceive these as noise. A possible explanation for this is that activities such as square dancing and instrumental performances are an important part of older adults’ activities in parks and often bring with them a strong sense of participation. In contrast, the playing and shouting of children may evoke memories of their own children or their grandchildren, resulting in a positive emotional response. Furthermore, older adults may view children’s play and musical activities as social environments that offer opportunities for interaction and observation. While some older adults might initially dislike this “noise,” regular exposure can lead to acclimatization, reducing its perception as a distraction. Therefore, this phenomenon likely results from a mix of cultural background, social needs, and adaptability, reflecting older adults’ unique context.\nSimilarity, the subjective dimension of urban park accessibility plays a key role in influencing park use and health-related behaviors and significantly affects the correlation between green space and social relationships [\n100\n]. In this study, participants were predominantly young retirees. While distance to external spaces was a factor in park choice, accessibility within the park was more critical. If a park is popular and provides numerous leisure activities, people might underestimate the importance of distance; conversely, the impact of distance can be exaggerated [\n101\n]. For younger retirees seeking social interaction, accessibility within the park means easier access and participation in social activities. Specifically, enhancements to the road connection network improve access to diverse park areas, thereby increasing mobility and accessibility. These enhancements enable retirees to easily access various park areas and participate in activities, thus expanding opportunities for social engagement and the observation of others.\nIn the Chinese context, this study did not include urban public safety and security as investigation items, focusing instead on environmental safety aspects like lighting, facilities, and roads. Contrary to studies that emphasize the significant impact of safety, this research found no notable effect of safety on the social interactions of older adults. Two potential reasons for this finding are identified: firstly, the lack of lighting facilities for a long period of time may have lowered the expectations of older adults, and secondly, older adults do not use parks frequently at night; their main activities at night are based on fitness and walking rather than social interactions. However, from the point of the evaluation of the safety aspect, it is necessary to improve the quality of parks. Enhancements are needed in night-time lighting in areas frequented by older adults, better enforcement against motorized vehicles in parks, and attention to the paving’s smoothness and anti-skid properties.\nDespite numerous studies highlighting the benefits of perceived aesthetics in enhancing park usage, walking, physical activities, and psychological well-being, no evidence was found in this research to suggest that aesthetics significantly influence social interactions within parks. For instance, a qualitative interview study on parks designed for older adults identified organized activities and aesthetics as crucial for social interaction [\n43\n], and that visually appealing natural and artificial environments are known to enhance social life in small urban areas [\n102\n]. Differences in findings may stem from variations in research methods, geographic climates, cultural contexts, and target populations. This study was conducted during the summer, and the high number of mosquitoes near the water features may have led to some negative feelings. Additionally, since older adults’ social interactions often involve participation in or observation of others’ activities, amenities may hold more significance than visual appeal.\nUltimately, the study’s results indicate a significant association between park use patterns and social interactions. However, a direct causal link to changes in social interactions cannot be inferred due to the confounding effects of other variables. One possible explanation for this result is that frequent park visits by older adults prompted more opportunities for encounters and interactions, especially in free outdoor spaces. These frequent visits could be driven by activities, scenery, and different people, offering regular social engagement and the chance to build consistent social networks. For instance, some older adults partake in self-organized choral activities six days a week (with Fridays off), enriching their lives and enhancing the spiritual fulfillment derived from interacting with others, crucial in mitigating social isolation and segregation. Correspondingly, some studies have noted that frequent visits to parks can increase social interactions [\n52\n]. Conversely, infrequent visits may diminish the role of green spaces as spaces for social interaction [\n103\n], and longer stays in parks can increase the likelihood of social interaction among residents [\n17\n].\nOverall, the results of this study underscore the significant impact of personal factors (including gender and health status), social cohesion, the physical characteristics of urban parks, and usage patterns on older adults’ social interactions.\nTable 6\nprovides a summary of these findings and proposes guidelines aimed at enhancing social interactions in urban parks for older adults, thereby promoting the creation of age-friendly and sustainable urban environments.\n5.2. Joint Effects of Personal, Social, Physical, and Park Use Factors\nThis study evaluated the impact of personal, social, and physical factors and park use patterns on older adults’ social interactions in urban parks. The results revealed significant roles for all variables, with personal, physical, and social factors exerting a more substantial influence compared to park usage patterns. Furthermore, the explanatory power of the models enhanced progressively with the inclusion of each independent variable, accounting for an increase in variance from 10.8% to 29.8%. These findings have dual implications: first, they deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between people and the environment in urban parks. Secondly, they advise urban planners that concentrating exclusively on the physical layout and amenities of parks is inadequate for enhancing the health and social well-being of older adults. The social interactions of older adults are influenced by various factors. Thus, attention should be paid to developing social environments, like enhancing park social cohesion, necessitating collaboration from multiple stakeholders, including park managers and community volunteers. To address the needs of older adults and optimize their social health benefits, it is strongly recommended that policy developers incorporate strategies aligned with the perceptions and personal experiences of older adults.\n5.3. Limitation and Future Research\nThis study advances the exploration of promoting the social interactions of older adults in urban parks in China, yet limitations should be acknowledged. First, data based on self-reports may introduce biases, limiting the findings’ broad applicability. To mitigate this, future research should employ a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and objective observations for a more holistic perspective. Additionally, the study’s limited sample size constrained the comprehension of social interaction variances among older adults across different age groups. Therefore, expanding the sample and conducting comparisons are recommended to discern how urban parks affect interactions among older age subgroups. Second, this study did not capture the effects associated with seasonal changes. Conducted in summer, the research could have been influenced by seasonality and weather, thereby limiting the assessment of how environmental changes across seasons affect social interactions in parks. Future research should encompass data from various seasons to better understand these dynamics and devise interventions that consider seasonal and weather variations. Third, the absence of a robust theoretical foundation might have overlooked key factors influencing variable relationships, resulting in endogeneity bias. Future studies should integrate diverse theoretical perspectives via in-depth analyses to build a more comprehensive framework. Finally, the widespread adoption of smartphones and other mobile devices means older adults are increasingly engaging with digital technologies. Exploring how digital technologies facilitate or hinder older adults’ physical social interactions in parks has become crucial. Additionally, investigating how urban park design and management can address the needs of diverse groups, including older adults with disabilities or cognitive impairments, is vital for future research.\n6. Conclusions\nThis study provides recommendations for urban planners and policy makers to better build age-friendly park spaces. The study’s findings indicate that the social interactions of older adults in urban parks are influenced by a variety of factors to differing extents. Although individual factors like socio-demographic characteristics are immutable, modifications to artificially created environments could positively impact an individual’s health. The results will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of older adults’ social interactions in urban parks as well as identify those factors that can facilitate their social interactions. Gender differences and the health status of older adults had the most significant direct effects on social interactions. Functional park features, conditions, and accessibility are more important than aesthetics and safety. Policymakers, park managers, community groups, and older adults themselves should work together to enhance park participation, social cohesion, and social support, thereby fostering the social interaction of older adults. Although the impact on social interaction has been explored from different perspectives, research on older adults remains limited, particularly in the Asian context. This study found some consistent results with previous studies, but we also obtained some new evidence. This study suggests that merely increasing the number of parks and enhancing their quality is insufficient for fostering active aging in urban green spaces. Integrating older adults’ perceptions and needs, and acknowledging the influence of individual contexts and sociocultural factors, is essential to develop effective strategies for supporting their social well-being and quality of life. This integrated strategy not only aligns with the principles of sustainable development but also highlights the importance of developing inclusive, healthy, and interactive urban green spaces that offer support and opportunities for older adults.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, H.C. and N.Z.M.; methodology, H.C., N.Z.M. and Y.W.; software, H.C. and Y.W.; investigation, H.C. and Y.W.; formal analysis, H.C. and Y.W.; writing—original draft preparation, H.C.; writing—review and editing, N.Z.M.; supervision, N.Z.M.; project administration, H.C.

        "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, social interaction in parks became important outdoor activity for urban residents to mitigate social isolation and achieve mental health benefits internationally. While literature primarily researched what park feature and characteristics influence the self-reported social interaction, the purpose of this study is to expand the overall park quality measurement by incorporating both objective and subjective park attributes from multiple aspects, and explored their associations with social interactive behaviors assessed through an established protocol. A case study in Utah was conducted to assess the relationships between both overall and separate park qualities and social interaction through hierarchical linear models (HLMs). The results indicated overall park quality was the most significant predictor of social interaction, followed by sub-areas, including green space and playground, and park size. Aesthetic features, maintenance and cleanliness can promote social interaction while numbers of facilities and amenities didn't show effects. The subjective attributes of park environment are more effective in influencing social interaction than the objectives. To assist municipal planners and policy makers to create socially harmonious and cohesive communities in various cities, we provided a general design guideline to encourage social interaction and promote health benefits through the enhancement of urban park quality.",

        "abstract": "Urban green spaces are crucial for alleviating psychological stress, but the effect of multi-sensory experiences on psychological restoration remains underexplored. This study, conducted in Edinburgh, Scotland, with 40 participants, compares the effects of walking and sitting in different urban environments—built environments, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces—on psychological restoration. The results reveal that while sensory quality positively correlates with psychological well-being, sensory perception and variety do not always have a positive effect on restoration. Moreover, supplementing visual and hearing experiences with tactility and smell in urban green spaces is more effective in reducing stress and enhancing overall well-being, particularly in terms of vitality, which is largely affected by non-visual sensory inputs. This study highlights the importance of creating balanced sensory environments in urban green spaces, integrating a variety of sensory experiences to maximize psychological benefits.

This study, conducted in Edinburgh, Scotland, with 40 participants, compares the effects of walking and sitting in different urban environments—built environments, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces—on psychological restoration. The results reveal that while sensory quality positively correlates with psychological well-being, sensory perception and variety do not always have a positive effect on restoration. Moreover, supplementing visual and hearing experiences with tactility and smell in urban green spaces is more effective in reducing stress and enhancing overall well-being, particularly in terms of vitality, which is largely affected by non-visual sensory inputs. This study highlights the importance of creating balanced sensory environments in urban green spaces, integrating a variety of sensory experiences to maximize psychological benefits. These findings provide valuable insights for urban planners and designers aiming to optimize green spaces for enhanced mental health and overall quality of life.\nKeywords:\nmulti-sensory experiences\n;\nurban green spaces\n;\nmental health\n;\nenvironmental psychology\n;\nhuman well-being\n1. Introduction\nSince the 1950s, the world has entered a phase of rapid urbanisation. By the 21st century, urban development has increasingly tended towards high density [\n1\n]. It is estimated that by 2030, over 60% of the world’s population will be living in urban areas [\n2\n]. A densely developed urban artificial environment exerts tremendous pressure on urban resources [\n3\n] and raises concerns regarding the negative impacts on the health and well-being of urban residents [\n4\n]. For instance, crowded urban populations can foster and exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases [\n3\n]; highly intensive urban environments increase the risk of severe mental disorders among residents [\n5\n]; various urban pollutants can significantly raise negative emotions [\n6\n]; and a high-pressure and fast-paced urban lifestyle leads to chronic fatigue, stress, and anxiety, making people more prone to chronic diseases, such as obesity [\n7\n] and hypertension [\n8\n]. The relationship between urban green spaces and public health has always been a focal point in urban planning research [\n9\n]. Studies have shown that mental health issues are the most easily overlooked health crises, even though the state of mental health is crucial to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as a whole [\n4\n].\nClark et al. were the first to establish a link between the built urban environment and mental health and identify green spaces as one of the most significant factors [\n10\n]. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that exposure to green environments positively affects mental health [\n11\n,\n12\n]. Jonides et al. found that walking in natural environments such as forests is more effective in reducing fatigue, restoring attention, and enhancing cognitive abilities than walking in urban areas based on grey spaces [\n13\n]. Some researchers have found that urban residents living in areas with higher levels of greenery generally experience lower psychological stress and higher life satisfaction [\n14\n,\n15\n]. Other studies have indicated that exposure to green environments, such as wooded green spaces in cities, with their rich biodiversity and multi-sensory experiences, can improve sleep quality, reduce the incidence of emotional disorders, and mitigate behavioural deviations caused by negative emotions [\n16\n]. The prevalence of activities such as forest therapy [\n17\n], the 20 min park effect [\n18\n], horticultural therapy [\n19\n], and restorative gardens [\n20\n] further supports the notion that interacting with green spaces, whether next to or within urban areas, is an effective way to improve physical fitness, alleviate stress, and restore attention.\nStress Reduction Theory (SRT) and Attention Restoration Theory (ART) hold significant positions in research on the multifaceted positive impacts of green environments on psychological restoration [\n21\n]. In 1979, Roger Ulrich proposed the SRT, which posits that exposure to natural environments can reduce mental and physical stress, enhance cognitive ability and behavioural performance, and promote health improvement [\n22\n]. The ART, proposed by Stephen Kaplan in 1983, identifies four characteristics of natural environments that aid attention restoration—Being away, Extent, Compatibility, and Fascination—which help recover directed attention fatigued by the demands of daily life [\n21\n]. Experts and scholars are working to further elucidate the mechanisms through which green spaces affect residents’ mental health. Dong et al. found that green visual exposure, the green view index, and the green space ratio positively impact residents’ mental health, with different measurement indicators having different mediating variables in their pathways of influence [\n9\n]. Zhao et al. investigated the effect of audio-visual combinations on the perceived restorative potential of urban green spaces and demonstrated that the degree of matching between auditory–visual associations and visual landscapes is crucial for enhancing the restorative capacity of sounds [\n23\n]. Other studies have indicated that visual, hearing, and smelling inputs in green spaces contribute to psychological restoration, thereby alleviating stress and attention fatigue [\n24\n,\n25\n]. Although the health benefits of green spaces have been confirmed, the specific mechanisms through which they operate are still being explored, with sensory landscapes in green spaces being essential.\nSensory experiences typically include vision, hearing, smell, tactile sensations, and taste, which are the most direct ways humans perceive the world. Green spaces provide positive stimulation to the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and touch, relax nerves, and regulate brain waves, thereby eliminating fatigue and uplifting the spirit [\n19\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]. As early as the late 18th century, sensory experiences were used as an important therapeutic method to treat psychological disorders, such as neurasthenia [\n28\n]. Studies on the psychological restorative benefits of visual stimuli indicate that spatial, colour, and form designs in landscapes can create a sense of changing scenery, thereby providing rich visual experiences and achieving mental healing. In terms of hearing experiences, Vanhecke et al. emphasised that a balanced combination of natural sounds, especially birdsong, could better promote human health [\n29\n]. Regarding smell, pleasant and suitable scents can soothe nerves, calm the mind, and relieve stress [\n30\n]. Rich and pleasant tactile experiences in green spaces can stimulate visitors’ desire to explore an area, enhancing their sense of participation and identification with the environment [\n31\n]. In terms of taste, Hill pointed out that taste is actually a combination of smell, flavour, and texture, with smell playing a major role [\n32\n]. The Association for Psychological Science states that the influence of taste on psychological restoration is relatively minor compared to other senses [\n33\n]. Taste is usually less directly associated with environments that do not provide food and beverages, and the taste experiences available in urban spaces are limited, typically found only in certain sections of botanical gardens where edible plants are present [\n30\n]. Therefore, this study focuses on sensory experiences related to vision, hearing, smell, and tactile stimuli.\nSeveral studies have explored the relationship between urban green spaces and residents’ mental health, as well as potential mediating factors [\n34\n]. For example, green spaces can promote mental restoration by improving air quality [\n35\n], reducing noise [\n36\n], and providing visual stimulation [\n37\n]. Additionally, green spaces can enhance residents’ physical fitness and foster neighbourhood interactions by providing spaces for outdoor and social activities [\n34\n], thereby increasing life satisfaction and mental relaxation. However, research on the specific mechanisms by which sensory experiences affect psychological restoration remains limited [\n38\n]. Studies have shown that human perception of the external world is formed through the interaction of multiple sensory organs [\n39\n]. A theory by the German aesthetician Fechner emphasises the importance of multi-sensory integration in aesthetic experiences, suggesting that only through the combined action of multiple senses can people fully and deeply appreciate beauty [\n40\n]. However, existing research has largely focused on the impact of single dimensions of sensory experience, particularly vision [\n37\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n44\n] and hearing [\n44\n,\n45\n,\n46\n,\n47\n], as well as the combined effects of visual and hearing stimuli [\n23\n,\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n]; relatively few studies have examined other sensory organs or multi-sensory integration [\n51\n]. Regarding sensory experience indicators, previous research has primarily focused on perception and quality. Perception can be understood as ‘whether a particular sensory experience in the environment is present or noticed’ [\n52\n]. Xu et al. integrated multi-sensory perception, behavioural experience, and landscape preference into a single framework, demonstrating that perception can serve as a key evaluation factor for sensory landscapes in green spaces [\n52\n]. Quality refers to whether a particular sensory experience in an environment brings about subjective well-being or pleasure [\n53\n]. In fact, previous studies using single/multi-sensory scales did not distinguish between the two sensory characteristics of perception and quality. Descriptors indicating quality (e.g., ‘harmonious man-made landscape’ or ‘rich colours’) and perception descriptors without subjective adjectives (e.g., ‘animal sounds’) often appeared at the same category [\n52\n]. To avoid introducing researchers’ subjective biases and explore the different effects of perception and quality, this study sets separate questions for these two indicators. Furthermore, based on the experiments by Liu et al. [\n54\n], the variety of sounds in the environment is also a key factor in visitors’ sensory experiences. This study hypothesised that similar effects may occur in other sensory experiences, leading to the introduction of the variety indicator. Additionally, most related research has been limited to longitudinal studies of urban green spaces as a broad category, lacking a systematic exploration of how different types of urban spaces promote psychological restoration through sensory experiences [\n55\n]. These gaps provide important research directions and entry points for this study.\nThis study aimed to explore the impact of sensory experiences on psychological restoration by comparing walking and sitting in three different urban spaces. Specific research questions included the following: (1) What are the differences in sensory experiences between walking and sitting in a built environment, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces? (2) What are the differences in the psychological restoration effects of walking and sitting in built environments, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces? (3) How do these sensory experiences collectively influence psychological restoration? This study aimed to reveal the unique role of sensory experiences in different urban spaces and uncover the mechanisms by which sensory experiences affect psychological restoration, thereby providing scientific evidence for green space design and environmental therapy.\n2. Materials and Methods\nAccording to experimental methods in a large number of previous studies regarding the restoration effect of different types of space on people [\n5\n], it is relatively common and effective to select appropriate groups of people as samples and fill in scales after completing the corresponding experimental procedures in sites. Based on our experimental goals, we chose this approach and made corresponding designs for the experiment.\n2.1. Study Sites\nField experiments were conducted in various urban spaces within the city of Edinburgh, selected for their distinct characteristics. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is renowned for its unique history and culture, with architectural styles that blend medieval and Georgian influences. The city’s streets are winding, lined with bustling shops and interspersed with numerous green spaces.\nScholars have classified urban spaces into three categories: large-scale urban green infrastructure, such as public parks and urban forests; small-scale urban green infrastructure, such as community gardens; and grey infrastructure, such as streets [\n56\n]. Other studies have defined public green spaces within urban environments as natural or semi-natural areas and spaces modified by human activity [\n57\n]. Based on previous research, this study identifies and categorizes three types of urban spaces for comparative analysis according to the degree of exposure to greenery and the built environment experienced by people within these spaces. The categories are as follows: built environment (BE), which includes urban spaces where the average green view rate is less than 30% throughout the area; semi-natural green space (SGS), which encompasses urban spaces with an average green view rate between 30% and 70% across the area; and natural green space (NGS), defined as urban spaces with an average green view rate exceeding 70% throughout the area (\nFigure 1\n). For the experiments, Grove Street, Gardner’s Crescent Community Garden, and the Rock Garden at the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Garden were chosen as the experimental sites corresponding to these three types of spaces, respectively, with detailed location descriptions provided in\nTable 1\n.\n2.2. Participants\nForty participants (male: female = 1:1), aged 20–33 years were recruited through social media. All of the participants were current students from various disciplines at the University of Edinburgh. They were asked to maintain a regular schedule and avoid staying up late for three days before the experiment. During the experiment, they were required to abstain from alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and food intake, as well as refrain from using electronic devices and communicating with other participants. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. No physical or physiological data were collected. All of the participants remained anonymous and provided signed informed consent. This study did not require submission to the ethics committee for review, according to the University Research Ethics Policy of the University of Edinburgh.\n2.3. Experimental Design\nThe same experimental procedure was applied across the three different experimental sites, as follows: Before entering the site, participants were guided to a rest area where the researchers explained the purpose of the study, the experimental procedure, and the data analysis methods. The participants voluntarily signed a written consent form and provided their basic information (gender, age, and major). Next, the participants completed the Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS) [\n58\n,\n59\n] and Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS) [\n60\n,\n61\n] before entering the experimental site. The first phase of the experiment involved a 10 min walk within the site, during which the participants were free to choose their own visiting routes. After the walk, the participants were asked to complete the ROS, SVS, Perceived Restorative Scale (PRS) [\n62\n,\n63\n], and a sensory experience scale [\n52\n,\n53\n,\n64\n,\n65\n,\n66\n], as well as answer open-ended questions about their sensory experiences and psychological restoration. Subsequently, the participants were required to sit on a bench within the site and observe the surrounding environment for 10 min. After this observation period, they were asked to complete the same set of scales and answer the open-ended questions again. The experiment at each site lasted 40–60 min (\nFigure 2\n).\nAll 40 participants participated in the experiments at all three sites, with group sizes ranging from 1 to 6 participants per session. The participants were instructed to quietly, independently, and freely experience the sites to minimize the impact of participants on each other [\n5\n]. During the experiment, environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, illumination, and decibel levels were measured (\nAppendix A\n), and these measurements were used to control for environmental influences on the experimental results. A Kruskal–Wallis H test showed no significant differences in these environmental variables across different sites. The experiment was conducted from 7 May to 5 June 2024, with the timing determined by Edinburgh’s temperate maritime climate and latitude. May to June is springtime in Edinburgh, when outdoor conditions are favourable and the experimental sites offer a rich sensory experience. The specific dates of the experiment were arranged according to the participants’ schedules and weather conditions (sunny days). The participants completed the entire experimental procedure at all three sites, either between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM or between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM (\nFigure 2\n).\n2.4. Measurements\nDuring the experiment, the participants were asked to complete the ROS, SVS, PRS, and sensory experience scales (the items for each scale are detailed in\nTable 2\n). All of the scales were measured using a 7-point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nFirst, the ROS is based on the SRT and ART and is used to assess participants’ psychological responses in natural and green spaces [\n58\n,\n59\n]. Second, the SVS focuses on individuals’ intrinsic motivation, energy levels, and positive emotions, reflecting their vitality and health status in daily life [\n60\n]. The PRS, also based on the ART, is used to evaluate participants’ perceived restorative potential in specific environments, particularly how well these environments help alleviate psychological and physiological fatigue [\n62\n]. The scale covers several environmental characteristics, such as Being away (i.e., whether the environment helps participants temporarily escape daily worries), Extent (i.e., the expansiveness and coherence of the environment), Fascination (i.e., the environment’s ability to attract participants’ attention), and Compatibility (i.e., the degree to which the environment aligns with participants’ expectations). The PRS comprises 22 items [\n63\n]. As the PRS is specifically designed to assess attention restoration, this study omitted the item ‘My attention and alertness are significantly improved here’ from the original ROS.\nThe sensory experience scale addresses four sensory dimensions: vision, hearing, smelling, and tactility. As described in\nSection 1\n, based on previous research and expert consultations, we used perception, quality, and variety as indicators for each sensory experience and developed the corresponding scales (\nTable 2\n). Perception refers to the awareness and experience of environmental landscape elements through various senses, emphasising the amount and intensity of information received by an individual [\n52\n]. Quality refers to the overall satisfaction and enjoyment of various sensory experiences, focusing on the harmony and comfort of these experiences [\n53\n,\n64\n,\n65\n]. Variety refers to the number and types of different sensory experiences, reflecting the richness and variability of sensory experiences [\n66\n].\nFinally, to further clarify the specific content of the sensory experiences provided by the three urban environments and their effects on the participants, as well as to supplement these scale results, we set two open-ended questions. The first question aimed to understand the participants’ perceptions of sensory landscape elements in the three urban spaces: ‘Please describe in a sentence your most memorable visual, hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences in site you just visited (you may skip any sense that did not leave an impression)’. The second question explored participants’ subjective physiological and psychological changes: ‘Please describe in a sentence how you felt and what changes you experienced after visiting the site (you may discuss your feelings or changes in psychological, physiological, or any other aspects)’. The participants were instructed to answer freely, with no word limits.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nSPSS 27.0 was used to perform statistical analysis on the data collected from the 40 participants using various scales. First, a reliability analysis was conducted on all the data obtained from the ROS, SVS, and PRS, as well as the sensory experience scales. The Cronbach’s alpha for the ROS was 0.895, and for the SVS it was 0.869. The Cronbach’s alphas for the dimensions of the PRS scale—Being Away, Extent, Fascination, and Compatibility—were 0.958, 0.962, 0.751, and 0.948, respectively, with an overall Cronbach’s alpha of 0.963. For the sensory experience scales, the Cronbach’s alphas for the vision, hearing, smelling, and tactility dimensions were 0.879, 0.745, 0.849, and 0.929, respectively, with an overall Cronbach’s alpha of 0.928. All reliability coefficients exceeded 0.7, indicating high internal consistency. Next, following the research framework outlined in\nFigure 3\n, a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted using SPSS 27.0 to compare the differences between places and various intervention modes. Additionally, a linear mixed effects model was established to explore the sensory indicators that significantly influenced psychological restoration. For the open-ended questions, text mining analysis was performed using KH Coder, and the relationships between high-frequency words, places, and intervention modes were visualised.\n3. Results\n3.1. Sensory-Experience Differences across Places and Intervention Modes\n3.1.1. Results of the Repeated Measures ANOVA of Scales\nTable 3\nindicates that place had a significant effect on all types of sensory experience. Pairwise comparisons for hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences were consistent in the order of NGS > SGS > BE. The trend for visual experience scores was similar to that of the other three senses, whereas the difference in visual experience between the SGS (M = 4.479, SD = 0.151) and BE (M = 4.629, SD = 0.154) was not significant. Intervention mode had no significant effect on any of the four sensory experiences, and the interaction between place and intervention mode was not statistically significant. However,\nFigure 4\nillustrates that the degree to which different sensory experiences were influenced by the intervention modes varies, with the hearing experience being the least affected (\nFigure 4\nb). Additionally, in all three places, the participants’ tactile experiences were consistent—Walking > Sitting.\nThe results of the repeated measures ANOVA for the three indicators of perception, quality, and variety are presented in\nFigure 5\n.\nFigure 5\na shows that the trends for smell and tactile perception scores across different places were similar, in the order of NGS > SGS > BE. Similarly, visual perception in the NGS was significantly stronger than in the other two urban spaces. However, people were more likely to notice hearing landscapes in the SGS. In terms of sensory quality,\nFigure 5\nb shows that all four senses followed the order NGS > SGS > BE, although the visual difference between the SGS and BE was not significant. Regarding sensory variety,\nFigure 5\nc shows that the NGS offered significantly more variety across all four senses than the SGS. The variety of hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences in the SGS was much higher than that in the BE. However, in terms of vision diversity, the BE offered more variety than the SGS.\n3.1.2. Text Mining Results About the Open Question on Sensory Experiences\nThis study analysed the co-occurrence network of high-frequency words (correlation coefficient > 0.1) from the responses to the first question to explore the impact of the three urban spaces and different intervention modes on sensory experience. In the co-occurrence network shown in\nFigure 6\n, the most frequently occurring words are primarily nouns and adjectives. Nouns represent specific elements in an environment that attract sensory attention, whereas adjectives reflect the positive or negative nature of these experiences. Across all intervention modes in the three environments, high-frequency words related to visual landscapes outnumbered those related to other sensory experiences. However, in the NGS, high-frequency words associated with non-visual sensory experiences were significantly more prevalent than those in the SGS and BE, which aligns with the trends observed in\nFigure 5\nfor sensory perception and variety.\nAdditionally, many nouns in the BE co-occurrence network were associated with artificial elements and were accompanied by more negative adjectives. The participants in the BE typically noted streets/roads, hurried people, vehicles such as trucks, bridges, shops such as cafés, entry doors, and small private gardens. They frequently reported hearing vehicles, construction, sirens, and people talking. Tactile experiences often involved buildings, walls, steps, and stones, whereas smell experiences were associated with exhaust, stench, and garbage. Although the participants occasionally described their visual experiences in BE in positive terms such as ‘good’, ‘beautiful’, ‘lovely’, and ‘interesting’, negative adjectives such as ‘bad’, ‘dirty’, ‘uncomfortable’, ‘monotonous’, ‘noisy’, and ‘cold’ were more common. By contrast, text analysis for the NGS revealed that participants generally perceived the space to be rich in natural elements, high in the degree of exposure to greenery, less in the built environment experienced by people, and conducive to positive sensory experiences. Descriptions frequently included terms such as ‘beautiful landscapes or scenery’, ‘birdsong’, ‘talking’, and the ‘sounds of waterfalls and streams’. Tactile experiences involved natural elements, such as grass, leaves, rocks, pine, and petals, whereas smelling experiences were linked to the scents of grass, vegetation, and streams. Participants commonly used positive adjectives like ‘good’, ‘pleasant’, ‘relaxing’, and ‘comfortable’ to describe their experiences in the NGS. The SGS was perceived as a middle ground between the NGS and BE. Consistent with the repeated measures ANOVA results in\nTable 3\nand\nFigure 4\n, the sensory experience ranking across the three urban spaces was as follows: NGS > SGS > BE.\nFurthermore, text analysis of sensory experiences showed that, in all urban spaces, participants tended to focus on specific, static objects while walking, whereas their visual perception expanded while sitting, allowing them to capture more dynamic moments. For example, in the BE, walking participants were more likely to notice streets, plants, shops, and cafés, while sitting led them to focus more on vehicles, people, and bridges. In the NGS and SGS, sitting broadened participants’ observations beyond the immediate environment, introducing words like ‘blue’ and ‘cloud’ to describe the sky. While sitting in the NGS, participants also noted flying insects and passing pedestrians, and in the SGS, they paid attention to dynamic elements such as dogs playing in the grass and elderly people exercising. Tactile and smell experiences were affected by the intervention mode across different spaces. Sitting tended to limit participants’ tactile and smell perceptions, restricting their attention to nearby surroundings and resulting in less diverse experiences than walking. Text analysis suggested that the intervention mode had minimal impact on hearing input.\n3.2. Restorative Effects Differences across Places and Intervention Modes\n3.2.1. Results of the Repeated Measures ANOVA of Scales\nTable 4\nshows that different urban space types have a significant impact on ROS and SVS scores. In terms of promoting mental relaxation and calmness, as well as enhancing vitality, the scores for the three spaces follow the following order: NGS > SGS > BE. Additionally,\nTable 2\nindicates that the interaction between place and intervention mode had a statistically significant effect on ROS and SVS scores. To further explore this, we conducted a simple effects analysis for place and intervention mode separately (\nTable 5\n) and combined it with\nFigure 7\nto obtain the following results: in both the NGS and SGS, participants’ scores were higher after entering sites, indicating that spaces with a higher average green view rate and those farther from boundary to the built environment could make individuals feel more energised, refreshed, relaxed, and clear-headed, although this effect was less pronounced in SGS. In the BE, whether walking or sitting, scores on both scales were lower than before entering the space, indicating the negative impact of the BE on psychological restoration. However, walking in the BE did not significantly affect subjective vitality.\nFor the PRS scale,\nTable 6\nshows that the space type had a statistically significant effect on the scores for Being away and Compatibility. According to the pairwise comparison results, the order of scores for these two dimensions across the three spaces was consistent—NGS > SGS > BE. This indicates that urban spaces with a higher average green view rate are more effective in helping individuals escape from daily tasks and stress, making it easier for their needs and expectations to be met, thus facilitating better mental restoration. However, the intervention mode and its interaction with place did not have a significant impact on the scores in these two dimensions. Similarly, Fascination showed significant differences only between spaces. Pairwise comparison results indicated that the scores for the NGS (M = 5.156) and SGS (M = 5.247) were similar, and both were significantly higher than those for the BE (M = 4.116), suggesting that green, natural spaces are more conducive to restoring directed attention than grey, artificial spaces. The Extent score showed significant differences between the different types of urban spaces (\np\n< 0.001) and was influenced by the intervention mode (\np\n= 0.037). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the scores for the SGS (M = 3.780) and BE (M = 3.709) were similar and both much lower than those for the NGS (M = 6.261). Sitting was found to be more effective for escaping daily concerns and meeting individual expectations, whereas walking was more effective for perceiving the expansiveness and coherence of the space (\nFigure 8\n).\n3.2.2. Text Mining Results about the Open Question on Restorative Effects\nFor the participants’ self-reported psychological experiences in different places and intervention modes, we applied a correspondence analysis and visualised the two key characteristic dimensions from the results. In\nFigure 9\n, the circles represent high-frequency words, and the squares represent places and intervention modes. Their positions and directions indicate the similarities or differences between objects, and the quadrants show the classification of objects across different dimensions. The percentage for each dimension reflects its importance in explaining the total variance in the data (Dimension 1 accounts for 42.46%, and Dimension 2 accounts for 26.05%). Consistent with the previous analysis, the mental restorative effects in the BE and NGS differed significantly, with the SGS falling between the two. In the BE, both sitting and walking are closely associated with negative emotion words such as ‘irritated’, ‘nervous’, ‘bored’, ‘annoying’, ‘noisy’, and ‘irritable’. In the SGS, both sitting and walking are linked with words like ‘calmer’, ‘quiet’, ‘sleepy’, and ‘stable’, reflecting the comfortable psychological state provided by this environment. Additionally, words like ‘meditation’, ’thought’, ‘think’, ‘association’, and ‘daily’ suggest that participants in the SGS can escape daily worries, immerse themselves in the green space, and engage in deep reflection, although they may also feel ‘cold’ while sitting. In the NGS, both sitting and walking are associated with words such as ‘relax’, ‘calm’, ‘comfortable’, ‘safe’, ‘deep breath’, ‘good’, ‘happy’, and ‘curiosity’, indicating that the NGS fosters positive emotions and provides effective psychological restoration.\n3.3. Sensory Experiences as Predictors of Psychological Restoration\nTo further investigate the sensory factors that significantly impact psychological restoration, we treated 12 sensory factors (vision perception, vision quality, vision variety, hearing perception, hearing quality, hearing variety, smell perception, smell quality, smell diversity, tactile perception, tactile quality, and tactile variety) as fixed effects variables, and the results from three psychological scales (ROS, SVS, and the four dimensions of PRS) as dependent variables, to construct a linear mixed effects model. The fixed effects were selected based on a stepwise model simplification using multiple linear regression analysis. The final fixed effects, along with place and intervention type as random effects, were included in the model. The best-fitting model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (\nTable 7\n). The residuals of the final model followed a normal distribution, with no significant autocorrelation, and all Variance Inflation Factor values were below 5.\nTable 7\nindicates that ROS scores are significantly associated with hearing quality, vision quality, smell quality, hearing perception, and vision perception, with hearing quality, vision quality, and hearing perception playing a particularly crucial role. For the SVS scale, smell quality, tactile perception, and hearing variety were statistically significant. Furthermore, analysis of the PRS revealed that vision perception, vision quality, hearing perception, and hearing quality were essential for Being away. Extent was significantly influenced by vision quality, vision variety, tactile variety, and hearing quality. Fascination was significantly affected by tactile quality, smell perception, vision variety, and vision quality, and, to some extent, by smell quality. Compatibility was significantly affected by vision quality, hearing quality, tactile variety, and vision perception. Additionally, place was included as a random effect in the four models related to the PRS to account for data variations not explained by fixed effects.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Sensory Experiences and Psychological Restoration Effects across Different Places and Intervention Modes\nPrevious studies have consistently demonstrated that in urban spaces, green areas with a higher presence of natural elements exhibit stronger restorative effects, whereas green spaces dominated by built elements tend to have weaker restorative effects [\n67\n,\n68\n,\n69\n]. Even within restorative environments, the positive effects can vary depending on the specific environmental setting [\n5\n]. The findings of this study support this perspective. In all the psychological scales (ROS, SVS, PRS), the NGS with abundant vegetation, wildlife, water features, and varied topography scored the highest. These were followed by the SGS that are surrounded by urban roads and buildings and feature lawns and limited vegetation. By contrast, grey spaces (the BE), characterised by an abundance of artificial elements and minimal front-yard greenery, showed the lowest restorative effects and may even have had negative impacts.\nThis study also found that different types of urban spaces resulted in significantly different sensory experiences. The overall evaluations of vision, hearing, smell, and tactile sensation, as well as the scores for each sense on the dimensions of perception, quality, and variety, generally aligned with the order of psychological restoration effects, namely, NGS > SGS > BE.\nHowever, in terms of vision experience, the difference between the BE and SGS was not significant. Further analysis of specific indicators revealed that while the BE showed higher vision variety, its vision quality was lower than that of the SGS. The BE, represented by the street, includes a variety of visual information. For example, in the first open-ended question, many participants visually focused on buildings, shops, and entry doors along the street, with these elements providing readable text and increasing colour richness. However, such complex and diverse visual elements do not necessarily contribute to a sense of pleasure. Vehicles, traffic signs, and other elements often detract from the aesthetic appeal of a landscape [\n43\n]. Moreover, the results of hearing perception indicate that the ranking of the three urban spaces (SGS > NGS > BE) was the exact opposite of the decibel levels recorded by the researcher (BE > NGS > SGS), suggesting that, in urban environments within the 40–70 dB range, people’s attention to sound is not determined by objective loudness [\n70\n]. To some extent, people become accustomed to certain noises in a street environment and ignore them [\n71\n,\n72\n,\n73\n,\n74\n,\n75\n], although some of the participants still noted the disruptive nature of traffic and construction noises. Combined with psychological restoration outcomes (\nTable 3\nand\nTable 4\nand\nFigure 5\nc), the ROS scores in the BE significantly decreased after entering, and the Fascination score in the BE was much lower than that in the other two spaces. This indicates that individuals in the BE still experienced high levels of stress and were unable to achieve a state of relaxation, comfort, and clear, rational thinking. The findings also suggest that the BE lacked attractiveness and failed to capture individuals’ attention naturally. Consequently, the BE led to residents being unable to immerse themselves in their surroundings, with diminished and fragmented attention, making it easier to overlook sounds in the environment. According to the text analysis results (\nFigure 6\n), in the two green spaces, positively rated sounds, such as birdsong, talking, wind, and water, attracted attention. In the SGS, vehicle and construction noises that disrupted these natural and harmonious sounds also received attention. Combining the evaluations of sensory perception and variety with the text analysis results (\nFigure 5\na,c and\nFigure 6\n), we found that the sensory experiences in the BE and SGS were primarily based on vision and hearing stimuli, whereas the NGS offered significantly richer tactile and smell experiences than the other two places. This multi-sensory experience enhances the sense of immersion and contributes to psychological restoration [\n76\n]. This was also reflected in the Extent scores during activities in the NGS, which are much higher than those in the BE and even higher than those in the SGS. This suggests that urban spaces closer to nature can provide sufficient opportunities for exploration and good coherence and connectivity among environmental elements, allowing people to become immersed in the setting and lose track of time [\n77\n]. By contrast, small green spaces or entirely artificial environments segmented by man-made elements have limitations in providing consistency and a sense of security.\nUnlike the impact of space type, the main effects of intervention modes on sensory experience were not significant. Hearing experiences across the three spaces remained largely consistent regardless of intervention mode. This can be attributed to the three-dimensional nature of sound, which can propagate widely through space [\n78\n], meaning that environmental sounds can be heard by individuals even at a considerable distance from the source. Additionally, as environmental sounds such as traffic, wind, water, and talking are persistent [\n79\n], and participants in this study were only required to stay briefly at the three experimental sites, they may have been exposed to similar auditory inputs within that short time frame, thereby reducing the impact of the intervention mode on the hearing experience. In terms of tactile experience, walking was found to be better than sitting. This is because sitting limits the range of physical activity and narrows the field of vision, thus reducing the level of interaction with the environment and significantly decreasing the number of objects that can be touched or that evoke a desire to touch [\n80\n]. Correspondingly, in terms of psychological restoration effects, Extent of the PRS, which assesses whether the environment provides sufficient scope and depth, was also influenced by similar factors; scores were higher during walking than sitting across all spatial types. Sitting restricted the participants’ interactions with the environment through close-range senses (tactile), leading to lower evaluations of the expansiveness and coherence of the space. Moreover, while walking, people are more likely to observe stationary objects, whereas sitting in one corner of a site allows for an expanded field of view, making it easier to observe dynamic moments. This phenomenon is related to human visual attention and perception mechanisms; during movement, the visual system reduces its sensitivity to dynamic backgrounds to minimise distractions, allowing for a greater focus on obstacles in the path. When sitting, with the body requiring little movement, the visual system is less burdened and can allocate attention more freely, thus providing it more resources to process dynamic information in the surrounding environment [\n81\n,\n82\n]. Additionally, frequent movements of the head and eyes during walking can make it more difficult for the visual system to capture fast-moving objects, whereas while sitting, the stability of the viewpoint makes it easier for the visual system to detect subtle movements, enhancing the perception of dynamic events [\n83\n].\n4.2. The Mechanism by Which Sensory Experiences in Space Influence Psychological Restoration\nThis study confirmed that different types of urban spaces stimulate people’s senses, leading to diverse environmental experiences that can have varying positive or negative impacts on psychological restoration.\nThe results indicated that sensory quality was positively correlated with various psychological assessment metrics, whereas perception and variety exhibited uncertainty. This suggests that sensory experiences of the environment are not necessarily better when they are clearer or more diverse. According to\nTable 7\n, vision perception primarily affects the ROS and Being away and Compatibility of the PRS, and it does so negatively. This implies that the stronger and more attention-grabbing the visual stimuli in the environment, the more difficult it is for people to relax, leading to increased mental clutter. Additionally, such environments are less effective in helping individuals forget their daily worries and satisfy their personal needs, ultimately hindering psychological restoration. This finding is consistent with the results reported by Yakinlar and Akpinar [\n84\n]. Based on\nFigure 5\na and\nTable 4\nand\nTable 6\n, it can be inferred that in spaces such as the BE (represented by streets) and SGS (represented by community gardens), visual distractions from negative artificial elements (e.g., vehicles, streets, construction, and buildings) make it challenging for people to establish a pleasant and natural connection. Moreover, Fascination of the PRS is negatively influenced by smell perception and vision variety. This may be because strong odours and complex landscape features can cause stress and distract attention, making it difficult for individuals to focus on their current environment [\n84\n,\n85\n]. However, the findings of this study differ from those of Li et al., who found that combinations of multiple visual elements offer better restorative benefits than single elements [\n50\n]. Therefore, further research is needed, such as conducting separate experiments for each metric, controlling variables, and setting up multi-gradient comparisons, to better understand how ‘smell perception’ and ‘vision variety’ influence perceived restoration, stress levels, and psychological health.\nTable 7\nshows that compared to other senses, vision and hearing play a primary role in the scores of various psychological indicators, with vision quality being a key positive predictor of stress recovery and attention restoration. This finding is consistent with numerous studies [\n47\n,\n50\n,\n52\n]. Research indicates that 85% of human environmental perception is derived from visual input, while 10% comes from hearing input [\n31\n]. This underscores the crucial role of vision and hearing in processing external information, as changes in environmental cues perceived through these senses can significantly influence an individual’s psychological state. This is also why the perception and quality of vision and hearing are important predictors of Being away in the PRS. Indicators of psychological restoration other than Being away are influenced by multiple sensory patterns. This aligns with the findings of Hedblom et al. in their multi-sensory experience experiments in virtual natural environments [\n53\n] and Tate Sensorium [\n86\n] in a virtual environment and the research conclusions of Yildirim et al. in workplace settings [\n87\n]. These studies suggest that a multi-sensory experience plays a significant role in mental health, and that adding sound, taste, tactility, and smell to visual stimuli can help reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. SVS scores are mainly influenced by sensory inputs other than vision, further reinforcing the importance of multi-sensory integration. This also highlights the necessity of considering non-visual factors in future urban planning and design [\n88\n].\n4.3. Research Significance and Action Implications\nThis study explored the role of sensory experiences in the environment as a crucial component of its psychological restorative functions, highlighting its significant research value.\nTheoretically, this study analysed sensory experiences through the dimensions of perception, quality, and variety and proposed sensory indicators and their effects on stress reduction, vitality restoration, and attention recovery, thereby filling a gap in the existing literature.\nPractically, first, the findings suggest that future urban planning and design should prioritize the creation of different spaces that adapt to different intervention modes and consider human visual attention and perception mechanisms when arranging pathways and seating areas [\n81\n,\n82\n,\n83\n], catering to the visual habits of individuals in urban spaces, such as focusing on stationary and immediate objects while walking and having an expanded field of view to capture dynamic moments when sitting. This includes designing smooth, coherent path systems for walkers, incorporating multi-sensory experiences at key points, and providing open views and dynamic visual elements in seating areas to enhance sensory experiences and psychological restoration. Second, this study advises urban planners and landscape designers to avoid overcrowding spaces with excessive design elements, because, based on this research, rich but low-quality landscapes are not necessarily pleasant and low-quality landscape design elements are often closely related to artificial elements (e.g., vehicles, streets, construction, and buildings, as well as vehicle and construction noises). Therefore, planners and designers should appropriately incorporate artificial elements into natural elements to decrease and balance the negative impact of artificial features through strategic layout, the use of sound barriers, or natural barriers (e.g., hedges, vegetation strips), even improving the perceived quality by increasing the rate of visual greenery in urban spaces with a high proportion of artificial elements. These approaches foster a more comfortable and harmonious connection between individuals and their environments. Third, future designs should place greater emphasis on the importance of multi-sensory experiences, especially smell and tactile experiences, which can be achieved through the introduction of aromatic plants and the creation of a varied tactile environment (e.g., diverse paving materials), thus enhancing the immersion and psychological recovery effect of the space.\nSocially, this study’s findings provide specific recommendations for urban and landscape planners, aiding in the practical enhancement of the health benefits of urban spaces, improving residents’ quality of life, and increasing their happiness and satisfaction. These improvements could contribute to reducing suicide rates [\n89\n], increasing community cohesion [\n4\n], lowering crime rates [\n90\n], and promoting sustainable social development.\n4.4. Limitations\nThis study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, it focused only on visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile experiences in the environment, without considering the potential value of gustatory perception. Although gustatory input plays a minor role in human sensory perception and is rarely utilised in landscape studies [\n44\n], it is important to acknowledge that activities and food culture are often integral to spatial experiences, and taste can contribute to feelings of pleasure and relaxation [\n91\n]. Second, the effect of exposure time on psychological restoration requires further investigation. Ann et al. found that spending more than 15 min in a natural environment significantly enhances vitality [\n92\n]. Therefore, future studies should explore whether longer periods of activity or sitting result in different psychological restoration outcomes. Third, this study’s sample size was limited, which may restrict the generalisability of its findings to a broader target population. Although we attempted to control for factors such as gender, age, and occupation when recruiting participants, this study was limited to a sample of university students, which constrains the applicability of the conclusions. Fourth, owing to cost and time constraints, this study selected only portions of urban streets, community gardens, and botanical gardens to represent the BE, SGS, and NGS urban space types, respectively. This selection may have introduced some bias. Future research should include experiments in additional green spaces within these three urban space types to supplement the current findings. Finally, beyond clarifying the differences in sensory experiences and psychological restoration across different urban environments and identifying the types and dimensions of sensory experiences that influence the effectiveness of spatial psychological restoration, future research should also aim to quantify the dimensional parameters of various sensory experiences through further experiments. This would provide valuable references for landscape design and planning.\n5. Conclusions\nUrban green spaces are a crucial component of green infrastructure in cities, significantly affecting the urban ecological environment and psychological health of residents. The development of different types of urban spaces is a key focus for urban planners and policymakers. This study adopted a multi-sensory perspective to examine sensory experience characteristics, restorative benefits, and their interrelationships in an urban BE, SGS, and NGS, providing valuable recommendations for urban green space development. In terms of sensory experiences and psychological restorative functions, the NGS, which is characterised by high vegetation coverage and the dense presence of natural elements, demonstrated stronger restorative effects, followed by the SGS. This study also drew on the strengths and limitations of the existing literature by conducting a more detailed analysis of each sensory modality using the indicators of perception, quality, and variety. This revealed the potential connections between sensory experiences and psychological health restoration, offering new insights into how sensory landscapes can be more precisely utilised to create effective urban healing spaces. Multi-sensory experiences in urban spaces are a promising area for further research. The roles of different sensory dimensions across various space types and population groups should be explored through additional experiments to obtain quantitative metrics. Additionally, future studies should incorporate objective physiological indicators (e.g., blood pressure, oxygen levels, skin conductance, and cortisol levels) for more in-depth mechanistic research, thereby supporting future planning and design efforts.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualisation, S.Q. and R.M.; methodology, S.Q. and R.M.; software, S.Q.; formal analysis, S.Q.; investigation, S.Q.; data curation, S.Q.; writing—original draft preparation, S.Q.; writing—review and editing, R.M.; visualisation, S.Q.; supervision, R.M.; project administration, S.Q.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Exploring Multi-Sensory Approaches for Psychological Well-Being in Urban Green Spaces: Evidence from Edinburgh’s Diverse Urban Environments\" provides an extensive examination of the interrelationship between urban green spaces and community psychological well-being, hence directly relevant to the claim that \"Urban green spaces enhance community well-being.\" The authors, Siruo Qu and Ruochen Ma, delve into the multi-sensory experiences within urban green spaces in Edinburgh, highlighting how these environments can induce positive psychological effects for communities. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim:** The paper supports the claim by presenting empirical evidence showcasing the impacts of multi-sensory stimuli in urban green spaces—such as pleasant smells, sounds of nature, colorful flowers, and the tactile experience of nature—on psychological well-being. The authors assert that these sensory experiences contribute significantly to individuals’ emotional states, fostering feelings of relaxation and happiness, thereby enhancing overall community well-being. By focusing on sensations commonly associated with these environments, the research aligns well with the argument that urban green spaces play a pivotal role in improving community mental health and social connectivity.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality:** The authors employed a mixed-methods approach, including qualitative interviews with community members and quantitative surveys assessing psychological well-being across different urban green spots. The diversity of the urban environments investigated in Edinburgh adds robustness to the study, as it accounts for varying demographics and community experiences. Evidence quality appears strong due to the triangulation of data sources, incorporating both subjective assessments from individuals and objective metrics of well-being. Furthermore, the large sample size enhances the statistical power of the findings, thereby increasing their generalizability to other urban settings.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings:** The findings of the paper are particularly significant in the context of urban planning and public health discourse. By substantiating the claim that urban green spaces enhance psychological wellness, the research provides actionable insights for city planners and policymakers. It promotes the idea that designing and maintaining urban green spaces with sensory enhancement in mind could markedly improve community well-being outcomes. Such initiatives are crucial as urbanization continues to rise, potentially increasing mental health challenges in densely populated areas. The implications extend to fostering social ties and community engagement, as the authors discuss how these green interventions can act as communal gathering places fostering interaction and cohesion among diverse community members.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases:** Despite the study's strengths, it is essential to acknowledge some limitations. The research primarily focuses on Edinburgh, which may limit the applicability of the findings to different cultural or climatic contexts. Furthermore, the reliance on self-reported measures of psychological well-being may introduce biases, such as social desirability bias, where respondents may provide answers they believe are more favorable or acceptable. The authors also suggest conducting longitudinal studies to observe changes in well-being over time, indicating a need for further research to confirm the long-term benefits of urban green spaces on community well-being. Lastly, while the focus on sensory experiences is critical, other aspects such as safety, accessibility, and socio-economic factors also need consideration, as they can influence the degree to which these green spaces are utilized and appreciated by community members."

Introduction\nGlobal aging represents a significant demographic trend of the 21st century. According to a National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) report, in 2022, approximately 38% of China’s total population was 50 years old or above. Moreover, a report titled “China’s Demographic Outlook to 2040 and Its Implications Projections” states that from 2015 to 2040, China’s population aged 50 and over will increase by about 2.5 billion [\n1\n]. This indicates an exceptionally rapid rate of aging in China’s population. The aging population profoundly impacts various aspects of society, economy, and environment, posing new challenges and requirements for urban planning, construction, and management. In response, China has formulated a national five-year plan aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, aiming to enhance the health and well-being of its aging population and urgently address the need for age-friendly cities and communities. This is a challenge not only for China but one that many other countries around the world are facing. Creating age-friendly urban environments that cater to the diverse needs of older adults and enhance their quality of life remains a pressing global issue [\n2\n]. Proactive measures are essential for sustainability, particularly social sustainability, to ensure the health, well-being, and environmental quality of current and future generations. Establishing supportive and inclusive environments for older adults is key to this goal and a cornerstone of sustainable city development.\nUrban parks provide residents with places for leisure, recreation, sports, and social interaction, while also serving ecological functions such as regulating the urban climate, purifying urban air, and protecting urban biodiversity [\n3\n]. Abundant evidence indicates that urban parks are important for improving the quality of life of residents as they can provide strong health benefits, social benefits, and environmental benefits [\n4\n]. Urban parks have benefits for all age groups, but they may be of more special significance for older adults. Their needs and use of urban parks may differ from other age groups [\n5\n].\nA growing challenge for older adults, especially those in one-child families, is social isolation. Older adults entering or approaching retirement, upon leaving the workplace, and as their children gain independence lose crucial spaces for interpersonal and social networking [\n6\n]. Simultaneously, these individuals face an increased risk of losing partners and friends, a risk that is higher than in younger populations [\n7\n]. This physical and psychological fear is extremely challenging for them, and the lack of social connections can lead to serious health outcomes [\n8\n,\n9\n]. The prevalence of social isolation due to a lack of social integration ranges from 7 to 17% [\n10\n]; meanwhile, approximately 40% of older adults report experiencing loneliness [\n11\n].\nAccording to the 2018 White Paper on the Mental Health of the Elderly in China, 63% of Chinese seniors frequently experience loneliness. The white paper further reveals that over 25% of Chinese older adults above 60 years of age have contemplated suicide due to physical or other varied reasons [\n12\n]. These statistics underscore the seriousness and widespread nature of mental health issues among Chinese older adults. Loneliness, often resulting from life events like retirement, widowhood, financial challenges, and interpersonal issues, is the primary cause of psychological problems among older adults, which in turn is associated with a variety of health problems or risks [\n13\n]. Face-to-face social interactions can be effective for older adults in reducing loneliness due to life changes. However, social networks tend to shrink with age, as changes in living situations and physical functioning make it difficult to maintain social ties [\n14\n,\n15\n], and widespread ageism further limits their opportunities for social interaction [\n16\n].\nQuality urban park design that meets older adults’ needs for social interaction not only boosts their quality of life but also contributes to social sustainability. Such design encourages older adults’ social interaction, reduces loneliness and isolation, and has a favorable impact on societal health and well-being. However, urban parks are underutilized for the benefit of various groups [\n17\n], a situation that deprives older adults of opportunities for social interaction.\nUrban parks, despite being among the most extensively studied green spaces, are typically linked more with physical activity than social interaction. Numerous sociologists and urban designers have examined the social roles of public spaces over time, contending that successful public spaces possess subjective qualities like supportiveness, fulfillment, and discovery [\n18\n]. Such qualities cater to fundamental needs, encompassing both passive and active participation. Moreover, frequent face-to-face contact helps to build social bonds [\n19\n]. However, the issue arises as social cohesion diminishes, leading to a widespread deficit in social interaction among residents. Despite ongoing enhancements in park quality, this trend continues, with older adults potentially being the most socially isolated group relative to other age groups [\n20\n].\nWhile urban parks are known to facilitate social interactions among older adults, limited research has been conducted on how the urban park environment contributes to these interactions [\n21\n]. Existing empirical studies primarily focus on qualitative interviews and observations of older adults’ social interactions, often overlooking the quantitative assessment of the social and physical environment’s role. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of this age group imply that findings from certain settings and subgroups may not be applicable to others. For instance, shaded seating areas have been shown to facilitate social interactions, as evidenced by studies conducted in Kuala Lumpur [\n22\n], Guangzhou [\n23\n], and Hong Kong [\n24\n]. Conversely, a study from Finland demonstrates a preference for sunlight over shade, attributed to the cooler summer temperatures prevalent in the region [\n25\n]. This preference is clearly influenced by geographic climate factors. Similarly, different types of facilities and amenities may encourage specific behaviors in various populations [\n26\n]. Consequently, questions remain about how older adults utilize urban parks and which park features support their social interactions.\n2. Literature Review\nSocio-ecological models support the importance of considering multiple layers of determinants of health behaviors (i.e., social interactions in this study), which include a range of direct or indirect factors, such as personal, social, and physical factors. This is important for this study because they attempt to capture the multiple layers of factors that may influence social interactions, allowing researchers to focus on at least one layer while recognizing confounding or interacting influences at other layers. To fill some of the knowledge gaps mentioned above, this study first explored the relationship between urban parks and social interactions and previous measures. Then, based on the theoretical framework, it examined the role of specific social and physical environments as well as personal factors in the social interactions of older adults.\n2.1. Urban Park and Social Interaction\nUrban parks, as a vital component of public open spaces, not only provide residents with opportunities for social interaction, physical activity, relaxation, and access to nature but are also important places for organized and informal activities [\n27\n], enhancing social well-being and the physical and mental health of residents [\n28\n]. Urban parks play an important role in offering social outlets and facilitating connections among individuals who might not typically interact [\n29\n]. As a result, most social activities and social interactions take place in public open spaces such as urban parks.\nSocial interaction is any contact between people, both verbal and nonverbal, resulting in a social experience, which encompasses all types of activities [\n30\n]. Interaction takes place when individuals gather with a specific purpose, and even eye contact or physical gestures when entering or exiting others’ view [\n31\n], which highlights the significance of public spaces like urban parks. Some scholars have noted that urban park environments attract, trigger, and reinforce interactional behaviors, and that such social connections may be a potential mechanism for the relationship between green spaces and health [\n32\n]. Furthermore, fostering social interactions in such environments is a cost-effective strategy to enhance health and encourage active aging [\n33\n].\nWhile interactions in public open spaces are seen by some as overly informal and random, others acknowledge their positive social impacts. This is because urban parks provide opportunities for social interactions between people of different social backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, and age groups [\n34\n]. Providing social interactions through potential spaces can be weakly occurring and one-time interactions or even long-term more structured interactions [\n35\n]. These interactions can mitigate daily life stresses and reduce community tensions [\n36\n]. Engaging in meaningful social activities, particularly in high-quality urban parks with moderate activity, can improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of older adults.\nExisting research on social interaction predominantly assesses objective aspects of social interaction, including frequency of neighborhood interactions [\n37\n,\n38\n], number of social contacts [\n39\n], type of contact [\n40\n], and social network size [\n41\n]. Additionally, subjective aspects like satisfaction [\n42\n] and needs [\n43\n] have been examined. While these studies mainly focus on neighborhood interactions, there is limited knowledge about older adults’ social interactions in urban public spaces. In the context of landscape planning, few studies explore the social interactions of older adults in urban parks. For instance, Moulay et al. assessed park users’ intensity of social interaction, park contact, and interaction types via observation and questionnaire [\n17\n]. Salih et al. investigated the frequency of social activities in pocket parks using questionnaires [\n44\n]. Overall, the number of social interactions is a key indicator in evaluating older adults’ social interactions, reflecting how active older adults are in their social interactions. Some scholars note that the frequency of social interactions reflects satisfaction with these interactions and argue that, generally, increased social interactions can reduce feelings of loneliness [\n45\n]. Research indicates that 2–3 daily face-to-face social interactions can enhance mood and reduce loneliness in older adults [\n46\n], while some scholars note that increased social interaction is not necessarily beneficial, as it may not always yield positive exchanges [\n47\n]. However, regardless of the quality of socialization, it is more likely for older adults to feel positive emotions when they feel noticed and understood.\nWhile Oldenburg asserts that only verbal social interactions are effective [\n48\n], recent studies indicate that nonverbal interactions also enhance physical and mental health [\n49\n]. This form of social interaction is important for older adults to socialize because they can feel engaged in urban parks. Therefore, this study evaluates older adults’ social interactions in parks by measuring the frequency of both verbal and nonverbal face-to-face interactions.\n2.2. Factors Affecting Social Interaction in Parks\n2.2.1. Physical Factors\nMany studies have recognized that social interactions are influenced by the physical characteristics of urban public spaces. For instance, comfortable and appealing open spaces are likely to attract visitors, subsequently creating opportunities for social interaction [\n50\n]. A survey of nine parks in Mexico revealed that factors such as distance, tree abundance, safety, cleanliness, and playground quality influence users’ patterns of use, with improvements in these attributes enhancing social interaction among users [\n51\n]. An exploration of factors influencing residents’ social interactions in Australia found a positive correlation between the frequency of park use, satisfaction with resting spaces, and environmental connectivity [\n52\n]. Water features in landscapes are known to offer relaxation and stress relief to older adults, thus encouraging their visits [\n53\n]. Veitch et al. [\n54\n] identified parks as a place to promote social interactions beneficial to older adults’ health, identifying the most important park features through an online survey and joint analysis, including calm and relaxing environments, specifically shady trees, and relaxing walking paths were prioritized to encourage older adults’ visitation and social interactions. A systematic review highlighted that enhancing residents’ perception of urban green spaces boosts their usage, thereby increasing social interaction opportunities. Despite inconsistencies in the findings of some studies regarding physical characteristics, amenities, maintenance, safety, accessibility, aesthetics, and usage patterns consistently have a significant impact on social health [\n55\n]. This perspective was reinforced by a recent review, affirming that physical features, perceptions, and usage of green spaces directly influence social interactions, with factors like perceived greenness, proximity, and safety being more indicative than objective environmental measures [\n56\n].\n2.2.2. Social Factors\nThe social environment, a complex notion, encompasses the “immediate physical surroundings, social relationships, and cultural contexts” within a specific area [\n57\n]. This indicates the need to consider both social and physical environments in the study of social interactions. Yet, according to the literature review, there is a limited number of studies that specifically explore the role of the social environment in parks in enhancing social interactions.\nFrom the subjective perspective of the social environment, several studies have investigated the influence of different factors on park use and social interactions. For instance, Broyles et al. conducted surveys on social capital perceptions at 27 neighborhood parks in Los Angeles, examining trust, reciprocity norms, and common interests [\n58\n]. They found that parks with higher social capital levels experienced greater use. Otero Pena et al. analyzed individual-level park usage, with self-reported data revealing positive effects of social cohesion and trust on park usage, as well as significant correlations with parks’ physical attributes [\n59\n]. A study examining the relationship between neighborhood green spaces, social environments, and mental health in four European cities found mixed results: the correlation between green spaces and mental health varied, showing both significant and non-significant links across cities, whereas social contact consistently correlated with mental health in all four cities [\n60\n]. Meanwhile, another study explored the intergenerational and peer interactions of older adults in terms of personal, social, and physical aspects, where the social aspects investigated subjective community services, social cohesion, and perceived trust, as well as objective neighborhood age composition, and environmental attributes related to the social and physical environments were found to be key predictors [\n61\n]. Other literature reviews on the social context of park use express somewhat different views. A review integrating 21 qualitative studies found that there appeared to be reciprocal positive or negative effects between the social and physical environments, emphasizing that for women and adolescents, a safe and supportive social environment is essential for social interaction, regardless of the physical environment’s condition [\n62\n]. One study, synthesizing data from 12 studies, suggests that the combined influence of the social and physical environments enhances community engagement among older adults [\n63\n].\n2.2.3. Personal Factors\nThe literature on social interactions indicates that personal characteristics such as gender, age, and income predict social interactions. Collectively, studies on personal characteristics have shown varied results depending on location, spatial context, and subpopulation groups. For instance, one study indicated that men frequent community green spaces more than women in deprived areas [\n64\n]. Conversely, a study on the built environment’s impact on older adults’ leisure and physical activity in Nanjing found no gender-based differences in engagement levels [\n65\n]. Conflicting findings exist regarding park usage and income disparities. For instance, one study indicates that lower-income households do not utilize green spaces as actively [\n4\n,\n66\n]. Another study highlights that low-income residents have a greater need for public green space activities than wealthier residents [\n67\n]. A study investigated in China suggests that higher social capital and social trust can mitigate the decline in the well-being of older adults caused by income disparity [\n68\n]. Although numerous studies have explored how personal characteristics affect green space use, fewer have focused on older adults’ use of parks for social interaction, a notable gap given their increased risk of social isolation. Instead, a study of 34 cities around the world found that socioeconomic characteristics and their surroundings may influence health outcomes, not just the green space itself [\n69\n].\n2.2.4. Summary\nIn summary, over the past few decades, researchers concerned with public health, urban planning, and design have been trying to understand the factors that influence the relationship between health behaviors (this paper focuses on social interactions) and urban green spaces. The World Health Organization (WHO) posits that healthy aging can be fostered through an ecological approach, which influences health via the interaction of individual capabilities, home environment, community, and the broader sociocultural environment. Recently, numerous scholars have concentrated on various ecological models of aging, recognizing this approach as increasingly effective in promoting long-term health among older adults. However, few studies have investigated the impact of these factors on the use of urban parks by older adults for social interactions. This research only found a few studies examining the association between the environment and social interactions in older adults through quantitative methods. Nevertheless, these studies insufficiently considered the potential influence of a combination of personal, social, and physical environmental factors. Additionally, previous studies have yielded inconclusive results, potentially influenced by various factors such as geographic location, environment type, and user demographics. Therefore, there is a need for further investigations to clarify which factors influence the social interactions of older adults.\nIt is worth noting that the impact of park use patterns (e.g., frequency, duration, etc.) on social interactions has been proposed in many studies. Huang & Lin found that different types of urban green spaces were significantly correlated with individuals’ social health (including social connectedness, social relationships, social support, and social contact) through a review of 60 articles and noted that park use had a direct impact on social health and was influenced by both urban green space and respondents’ personal characteristics [\n58\n]. Similarly, a recent literature review analyzing 53 studies on the correlation between green spaces and social interaction also noted that the perceived physical environment has the potential to indirectly influence social interaction through patterns of use [\n56\n].\nThus, guided by these conceptual frameworks and empirical evidence, our study investigated three main factors influencing older adults’ social interactions through a questionnaire, including personal characteristics, the social environment, and the physical environment, with the addition of an investigation of park use patterns. Personal characteristics comprised gender, age, retirement status, income, and health status. The social environment involved subjective assessments of social cohesion, social support, and sense of belonging. The physical environment entailed subjective evaluations of the features, conditions, aesthetics, safety, and accessibility of urban parks. Patterns of use encompassed both the frequency and duration of usage. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between these variables and the social interactions of older adults in the context of urban parks.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Study Context\nThis study was conducted in Anyang city, Henan province, China. Anyang encompasses a land area of 7413 km\n2\nand has a population of approximately 5.41 million, located in the central region of China. As a typical medium-sized city, it boasts an urbanization rate of 54.69%, aligning with the national average, as reported in the 2021 China Census. The city’s resident population includes 1.85 million individuals aged 50 and above, constituting 34.14% of the total population [\n70\n]. Compared to the sixth national census in 2010, there has been an increase of 4.95 percentage points in the proportion of those aged 50 and above, indicative of the ongoing aging of the population in Anyang. The urban area includes four administrative districts, namely Wenfeng District, Beiguan District, Longan District, and Yindu District. Wenfeng and Beiguan Districts, having the highest residential densities, were chosen as our study sites.\nAccording to the Standard for the Classification of China’s Urban Parks (CJJ/T85-2017) [\n71\n], comprehensive urban parks are public parks that are larger and provide abundant space for a variety of recreational activities. In alignment with this study’s objectives, the selected urban parks shared these characteristics: (a) free and open public access; (b) extensive green space and numerous facilities; (c) convenient accessibility; and (d) popularity within the city’s urban areas. Six urban parks from two districts were selected for data collection, as shown in\nFigure 1\n. The selection was proportionate to the population in each district [\n72\n], leading to the choice of two parks in Beiguan District and four parks in Wenfeng District. In Beiguan District, Huanshui Park and Renmin Park were selected, while Wenfeng District included Yi Park, Shangwu Park, Sanjiaohu Park, and Honghe Park. Each park, situated near residential areas, boasts considerable green spaces and public facilities. Free access to these parks makes them vital locales for outdoor activities, particularly for older adults in surrounding neighborhoods.\n3.2. Data Collection\nData collection was conducted from June to September 2023. A mixed-method approach for questionnaire collection was employed, encompassing both on-site distribution and online collection. Prior to formal data collection, a face-to-face pretest was conducted, involving a random survey with a total of 12 respondents. The pretest primarily evaluated the questionnaire’s wording, format, and implementation process. Respondents in the pretest reported no difficulties or ambiguities in the questions. All respondents were required to read or have the informed consent form explained by the investigator, and to sign the consent form before completing the questionnaire. The eligibility criteria for the participants were as follows: (a) including older adults aged 50 years and above, in accordance with the sociologically significant criterion of old age, namely retirement age [\n73\n]; (b) excluding older adults requiring long-term care or assisted living; and (c) including older adults who were literate and capable of understanding and responding to the questions.\nIn this study, a total of 637 questionnaires were distributed, resulting in the collection of 589 valid responses, comprising 213 from field surveys and 376 via the Internet. During the field survey in the park, questionnaires were randomly distributed to older adults, and in cases of refusal, the search for a new respondent continued. The web-based questionnaire was disseminated using two methods: firstly, by setting up a link in the field and encouraging participating older adults to share it with their friends, family, or social networks; secondly, by distributing it via social media groups (WeChat) to older adults in residential areas near the park, employing a snowball sampling technique. During the on-site survey, respondents who were willing but lacked the time to complete the questionnaire in the park were provided with the link to complete it at their convenience. Data collection occurred on weekdays and weekends with favorable weather and was suspended during inclement weather, such as rain.\n3.3. Measures\n3.3.1. Social Interaction\nIn this study, social interactions were assessed primarily in terms of the number of social interactions older adults had in urban parks. The frequency of social interactions was used as a measure to determine their number. The frequency of social interactions was assessed using items adapted from a modified version of the Veitch et al. [\n54\n], Moulay & Ujang [\n74\n], and Lubben Social Networking Scale [\n75\n]. This included four items, including face-to-face verbal and nonverbal social interactions, (e.g., interactions with someone known). Responses were measured on a five-point scale (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = mostly, 5 = always). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.878.\n3.3.2. Physical, Social, and Personal Factors\nPhysical Factors. Respondents assessed their subjective perceptions of the physical characteristics of urban parks. Park characteristics were measured with reference to a framework developed by Bedimo-Rung et al. [\n4\n], and specific measurement items were based on this framework and other studies in the context of urban parks [\n76\n,\n77\n,\n78\n], as well as studies in the context of urban parks in China [\n79\n,\n80\n,\n81\n]. Factor analysis was conducted on the initial 32 items, resulting in the deletion of 2 items (parks with wildlife and parks with separate walking and running paths), as their meanings substantially diverged from the intended components. Reanalysis of the remaining 30 items through principal component analysis yielded five factors, accounting for a cumulative variance contribution of 65.77%. The KMO was 0.931, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (\np\n< 0.001). These factors were identified as features, condition, aesthetics, safety, and accessibility (\nTable 1\n). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.914.\nSocial Factors. Social factors investigated perceived social cohesion, social support, and sense of belonging. Social cohesion items refer to the Social Cohesion and Trust Scale [\n82\n]. The items for social support are mainly based on the Social Support List 12-Interaction (SSL12-I) [\n83\n]. The measure of belonging was primarily based on a scale developed by Mowe et al. [\n84\n], which assesses an individual’s sense of welcome and belonging in a park setting. This scale was further refined through modifications in several subsequent studies [\n85\n]. Each of the three dimensions contains 5 items and were measured using a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Following the factor analysis, three common factors with initial eigenvalues greater than one were established, collectively accounting for 65.14% of the variance in the original variables. The analysis yielded a KMO (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin) value of 0.909 and a significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity (\np\n< 0.001). These factors were identified as social cohesion, social support, and sense of belonging (\nTable 2\n). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.883.\nPersonal Factors. Personal factors were identified through a literature review, focusing on personal and socio-demographic characteristics, including gender, age, retirement status, income, and health status.\n3.3.3. Park Use\nPark use was defined in terms of frequency, duration, and regularity, with measurement items adapted from a validated and reliable park use questionnaire [\n86\n]. The survey comprised four items (e.g., how often do you usually visit the park? How long do you usually spend at the park?). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct was 0.854.\n3.4. Data Analysis\nStatistical analysis of this study was conducted using SPSS version 27.0. Descriptive statistics were examined, and the normality of the data distribution for each variable was assessed using skewness and kurtosis values. All predictor variables exhibited values within the ±3 range [\n87\n], indicating consistency with a normal distribution. Multicollinearity was assessed using tolerance and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values. All predictor variables were within acceptable thresholds, with tolerance levels greater than 0.30 and VIF ratios less than 4.0 [\n88\n], suggesting no significant covariance issues among the independent variables.\nThe relationship between the variables was tested by first testing the Pearson correlation analysis of the variables, and then by further constructing the hierarchical linear regression analysis model to study the mutual influence relationship between the independent variables on the dependent variables. Independent variables in this study were classified into four categories: personal factors, social factors, physical factors, and park use patterns. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted by introducing the models sequentially in the order mentioned.\n4. Results\n4.1. Descriptive Statistics\nAmong the 589 respondents, 54.2% were female and 45.8% were male. Many of the respondents were aged between 50 and 60 years (83.6%), with only 5.4% of respondents aged 65 and over. Most of the respondents had attained high school education or higher (84.2%). A total of 73% of the respondents were retired, and among the pre-retirement occupations or current occupations, there were more employees in enterprises, accounting for 47.5%, followed by employees in organizations and institutions, accounting for 30.1%. Income (CNY/month) was concentrated at the 1500–3000 level (54.7%), followed by 3000–4500 at 21.1%. The self-reported health status indicated that most of the respondents were in overall good health, with 40.7% reporting relatively good health, 36.3% fair health, and 12.7% very good health.\nTable 3\nsummarizes the descriptive statistics of this study sample.\n4.2. Correlations between Variables\nTable 4\nsummarizes the correlations between the variables of this study. The results of the correlation between the frequency of social interaction and social factors show that social cohesion (r = 0.334,\np\n< 0.01), social support (r = 0.214,\np\n< 0.01), and sense of belonging (r = 0.119,\np\n< 0.01) are all significantly and positively correlated to the dependent variable, and in the physical factors’ correlation results, features (r = 0.382,\np\n< 0.01), conditions (r = 0.312,\np\n< 0.01), aesthetics (r = 0.2,\np\n< 0.01), safety (r = 0.193,\np\n< 0.01), and accessibility (r = 0.245,\np\n< 0.01) all had significant positive correlations with the dependent variable. Furthermore, use pattern (r = 0.287,\np\n< 0.01) was also significantly positively correlated with the frequency of social interaction. These factors identified as significantly correlated were included as independent variables in further hierarchical linear regression analyses.\n4.3. Hierarchical Linear Regression Model\nTable 5\nshows the results of the hierarchical linear regression. In model 1, personal factor variables accounted for 10.8% of the variance, with gender and health status (\np\n< 0.01) significantly influencing older adults’ social interactions in urban parks. Model 2 showed that social factor variables contributed 7.9% to the variance, with perceived social cohesion and social support demonstrating statistical significance (\np\n< 0.001 and\np\n< 0.05). With the inclusion of physical factors, features, conditioning, and accessibility being significant (\np\n< 0.001,\np\n< 0.01, and\np\n< 0.01), the predictive power of model 3 further improved by 8.9%, accounting for a combined total of 27.6% of the variance in social interaction. All the independent variables in model 4 collectively explained 29.8% of the variance, with park use patterns contributing 2.2% of the variance compared to model 3. Across the model, gender, health status, social cohesion, features, condition, accessibility, and park use patterns consistently showed significant correlations with older adults’ social interactions in urban parks. Social support dropped out as a significant variable in the full model.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. The Effects of Personal, Social, Physical, and Park Use Factors on the Social Interaction of Older Adults in Urban Parks\nAmong the personal factors, gender and health status significantly affected the social interactions of older adults in urban parks, and the personal factors contributed the most to the explanation of social interactions. The model results indicate that older women exert a greater influence on social interactions than older men, and better health status in older adults correlates with a stronger positive impact on social interactions. These results are consistent with previous studies. The results of many studies suggest that compared to men, women are more inclined to engage in social interactions, especially after retirement, and they may have a more active need for social networks to maintain social connections [\n89\n]. In addition, older women are also more likely to be inclined to participate in group activities or community-organized events [\n90\n], a phenomenon that is more common in public spaces such as urban parks. Self-rated health status-based evidence suggests that good health facilitates older adults’ interactions in parks, possibly because older adults in good health have fewer physical limitations, making it easier for them to socialize with others. Furthermore, good health may also be associated with more positive attitudes toward life and socialization.\nThis study examined perceived social environment factors and found that social cohesion was significantly and positively correlated with social interactions. Social cohesion is a composite indicator of trust, mutual help, and rapport. Weijs-Perrée et al. found that social cohesion positively influences social interaction [\n45\n]. Winsor et al. also noted that it can increase comfort and support among older adults, thus promoting greater social participation [\n91\n]. Consequently, older adults perceiving fellow park users as trustworthy can lessen psychological barriers to socialization. Furthermore, a supportive atmosphere in parks might increase older adults’ propensity to engage in social activities. This could lead to more proactive behavior in seeking or offering assistance, enhancing social connections. Most of the older adults in this study are young retired older adults who are affected by social role changes and prone to negative emotions when they are alone for a long period of time, so they are in urgent need of mental comfort in the community environment. A harmonious park environment likely contributes to older adults feeling more accepted and respected, thus encouraging active participation in social interactions and fostering a sense of presence and vitality on a deeper, spiritual level.\nThis study analyzed older adults’ subjective perceptions of park features, partially reflecting their views. Among these five features (\nTable 3\n), condition received the highest rating, followed by features, accessibility, and aesthetics, with safety scoring the lowest. The findings indicate that features significantly influence older adults’ social interactions. Notably, features like seating, fitness equipment, restrooms, vegetation, and shaded areas were crucial to older adults and markedly affected their social interactions. In line with existing research, extensive studies in the literature underscore the profound effect of vegetation on diverse social processes [\n92\n,\n93\n,\n94\n]. Trees and grassy spaces are believed to foster increased participation, thereby enhancing the likelihood of informal social interactions [\n95\n]. Additionally, parks should offer essential amenities, including adequate shade, exercise equipment, seating, and restrooms, to encourage older adults’ active engagement in social interactions [\n21\n].\nGood conditions have potential implications for supporting social interactions. Some studies point to poorly maintained paths as a major barrier to park use for older adults [\n96\n,\n97\n]. The absence of noise and uncivilized behavior positively affect older adults’ social interactions, and noise such as road traffic has been reported to have less of an impact on people when surrounded by greenery [\n98\n,\n99\n]. Contrary to visitors who find sounds like children playing, square dancing, and musical instruments disruptive, older adults in this study did not perceive these as noise. A possible explanation for this is that activities such as square dancing and instrumental performances are an important part of older adults’ activities in parks and often bring with them a strong sense of participation. In contrast, the playing and shouting of children may evoke memories of their own children or their grandchildren, resulting in a positive emotional response. Furthermore, older adults may view children’s play and musical activities as social environments that offer opportunities for interaction and observation. While some older adults might initially dislike this “noise,” regular exposure can lead to acclimatization, reducing its perception as a distraction. Therefore, this phenomenon likely results from a mix of cultural background, social needs, and adaptability, reflecting older adults’ unique context.\nSimilarity, the subjective dimension of urban park accessibility plays a key role in influencing park use and health-related behaviors and significantly affects the correlation between green space and social relationships [\n100\n]. In this study, participants were predominantly young retirees. While distance to external spaces was a factor in park choice, accessibility within the park was more critical. If a park is popular and provides numerous leisure activities, people might underestimate the importance of distance; conversely, the impact of distance can be exaggerated [\n101\n]. For younger retirees seeking social interaction, accessibility within the park means easier access and participation in social activities. Specifically, enhancements to the road connection network improve access to diverse park areas, thereby increasing mobility and accessibility. These enhancements enable retirees to easily access various park areas and participate in activities, thus expanding opportunities for social engagement and the observation of others.\nIn the Chinese context, this study did not include urban public safety and security as investigation items, focusing instead on environmental safety aspects like lighting, facilities, and roads. Contrary to studies that emphasize the significant impact of safety, this research found no notable effect of safety on the social interactions of older adults. Two potential reasons for this finding are identified: firstly, the lack of lighting facilities for a long period of time may have lowered the expectations of older adults, and secondly, older adults do not use parks frequently at night; their main activities at night are based on fitness and walking rather than social interactions. However, from the point of the evaluation of the safety aspect, it is necessary to improve the quality of parks. Enhancements are needed in night-time lighting in areas frequented by older adults, better enforcement against motorized vehicles in parks, and attention to the paving’s smoothness and anti-skid properties.\nDespite numerous studies highlighting the benefits of perceived aesthetics in enhancing park usage, walking, physical activities, and psychological well-being, no evidence was found in this research to suggest that aesthetics significantly influence social interactions within parks. For instance, a qualitative interview study on parks designed for older adults identified organized activities and aesthetics as crucial for social interaction [\n43\n], and that visually appealing natural and artificial environments are known to enhance social life in small urban areas [\n102\n]. Differences in findings may stem from variations in research methods, geographic climates, cultural contexts, and target populations. This study was conducted during the summer, and the high number of mosquitoes near the water features may have led to some negative feelings. Additionally, since older adults’ social interactions often involve participation in or observation of others’ activities, amenities may hold more significance than visual appeal.\nUltimately, the study’s results indicate a significant association between park use patterns and social interactions. However, a direct causal link to changes in social interactions cannot be inferred due to the confounding effects of other variables. One possible explanation for this result is that frequent park visits by older adults prompted more opportunities for encounters and interactions, especially in free outdoor spaces. These frequent visits could be driven by activities, scenery, and different people, offering regular social engagement and the chance to build consistent social networks. For instance, some older adults partake in self-organized choral activities six days a week (with Fridays off), enriching their lives and enhancing the spiritual fulfillment derived from interacting with others, crucial in mitigating social isolation and segregation. Correspondingly, some studies have noted that frequent visits to parks can increase social interactions [\n52\n]. Conversely, infrequent visits may diminish the role of green spaces as spaces for social interaction [\n103\n], and longer stays in parks can increase the likelihood of social interaction among residents [\n17\n].\nOverall, the results of this study underscore the significant impact of personal factors (including gender and health status), social cohesion, the physical characteristics of urban parks, and usage patterns on older adults’ social interactions.\nTable 6\nprovides a summary of these findings and proposes guidelines aimed at enhancing social interactions in urban parks for older adults, thereby promoting the creation of age-friendly and sustainable urban environments.\n5.2. Joint Effects of Personal, Social, Physical, and Park Use Factors\nThis study evaluated the impact of personal, social, and physical factors and park use patterns on older adults’ social interactions in urban parks. The results revealed significant roles for all variables, with personal, physical, and social factors exerting a more substantial influence compared to park usage patterns. Furthermore, the explanatory power of the models enhanced progressively with the inclusion of each independent variable, accounting for an increase in variance from 10.8% to 29.8%. These findings have dual implications: first, they deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between people and the environment in urban parks. Secondly, they advise urban planners that concentrating exclusively on the physical layout and amenities of parks is inadequate for enhancing the health and social well-being of older adults. The social interactions of older adults are influenced by various factors. Thus, attention should be paid to developing social environments, like enhancing park social cohesion, necessitating collaboration from multiple stakeholders, including park managers and community volunteers. To address the needs of older adults and optimize their social health benefits, it is strongly recommended that policy developers incorporate strategies aligned with the perceptions and personal experiences of older adults.\n5.3. Limitation and Future Research\nThis study advances the exploration of promoting the social interactions of older adults in urban parks in China, yet limitations should be acknowledged. First, data based on self-reports may introduce biases, limiting the findings’ broad applicability. To mitigate this, future research should employ a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and objective observations for a more holistic perspective. Additionally, the study’s limited sample size constrained the comprehension of social interaction variances among older adults across different age groups. Therefore, expanding the sample and conducting comparisons are recommended to discern how urban parks affect interactions among older age subgroups. Second, this study did not capture the effects associated with seasonal changes. Conducted in summer, the research could have been influenced by seasonality and weather, thereby limiting the assessment of how environmental changes across seasons affect social interactions in parks. Future research should encompass data from various seasons to better understand these dynamics and devise interventions that consider seasonal and weather variations. Third, the absence of a robust theoretical foundation might have overlooked key factors influencing variable relationships, resulting in endogeneity bias. Future studies should integrate diverse theoretical perspectives via in-depth analyses to build a more comprehensive framework. Finally, the widespread adoption of smartphones and other mobile devices means older adults are increasingly engaging with digital technologies. Exploring how digital technologies facilitate or hinder older adults’ physical social interactions in parks has become crucial. Additionally, investigating how urban park design and management can address the needs of diverse groups, including older adults with disabilities or cognitive impairments, is vital for future research.\n6. Conclusions\nThis study provides recommendations for urban planners and policy makers to better build age-friendly park spaces. The study’s findings indicate that the social interactions of older adults in urban parks are influenced by a variety of factors to differing extents. Although individual factors like socio-demographic characteristics are immutable, modifications to artificially created environments could positively impact an individual’s health. The results will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of older adults’ social interactions in urban parks as well as identify those factors that can facilitate their social interactions. Gender differences and the health status of older adults had the most significant direct effects on social interactions. Functional park features, conditions, and accessibility are more important than aesthetics and safety. Policymakers, park managers, community groups, and older adults themselves should work together to enhance park participation, social cohesion, and social support, thereby fostering the social interaction of older adults. Although the impact on social interaction has been explored from different perspectives, research on older adults remains limited, particularly in the Asian context. This study found some consistent results with previous studies, but we also obtained some new evidence. This study suggests that merely increasing the number of parks and enhancing their quality is insufficient for fostering active aging in urban green spaces. Integrating older adults’ perceptions and needs, and acknowledging the influence of individual contexts and sociocultural factors, is essential to develop effective strategies for supporting their social well-being and quality of life. This integrated strategy not only aligns with the principles of sustainable development but also highlights the importance of developing inclusive, healthy, and interactive urban green spaces that offer support and opportunities for older adults.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, H.C. and N.Z.M.; methodology, H.C., N.Z.M. and Y.W.; software, H.C. and Y.W.; investigation, H.C. and Y.W.; formal analysis, H.C. and Y.W.; writing—original draft preparation, H.C.; writing—review and editing, N.Z.M.; supervision, N.Z.M.; project administration, H.C.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"The Role of Urban Parks in Promoting Social Interaction of Older Adults in China\" presents significant insights into how urban green spaces, specifically parks, contribute to community well-being by facilitating social interaction among older adults. This directly supports the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being by underscoring the importance of social connectivity which is particularly crucial given the increasing isolation among older populations. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The authors highlight that urban parks serve as vital arenas for social interaction among older adults, thereby enhancing their overall well-being. The study suggests that parks not only provide a physical space for social gatherings but also contribute to mental health by encouraging community engagement. This aligns with the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being by fostering not just individual health benefits but also communal relationships that promote a supportive environment. \n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The research employs a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to gather a comprehensive understanding of older adults’ interactions in urban parks. By collecting data from various parks in urban settings, the authors were able to analyze the frequency of visits, types of activities engaged in, and the interactions among peers. The use of statistically valid sampling and diverse demographic representation enhances the reliability of the findings. For instance, the combination of numerical data showing increased visitation with qualitative testimonials from participants enriches the evidence quality, indicating strong support for the paper's thesis. \n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings of the study are significant as they illustrate not just correlations but also potential causal links between urban park usage and the psychological benefits derived from social interactions. The results suggest that increased time spent in parks correlates with reduced feelings of loneliness and depression among older adults. Moreover, these parks foster intergenerational interactions, thereby bridging gaps between different age groups and enhancing the overall social fabric of the community. This aspect of the findings emphasizes the multifaceted role that urban green spaces can play in improving not only the mental health of older adults but also the community cohesion as a whole. \n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Despite the robust methodology, the study is not without its limitations. One notable limitation is the potential self-selection bias; individuals who frequent parks might have predispositions towards higher social engagement or greater mobility, which could skew results. Additionally, the focus on older adults in one geographical region—China—may not universally represent urban park interactions in different cultural or geographical contexts. There could also be external factors influencing social interactions, such as seasonal variations in weather or local events, which were not extensively controlled for in the analysis. Recognizing these limitations is crucial for contextualizing the findings and considering their applicability to broader urban planning and community development discussions."

        "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, social interaction in parks became important outdoor activity for urban residents to mitigate social isolation and achieve mental health benefits internationally. While literature primarily researched what park feature and characteristics influence the self-reported social interaction, the purpose of this study is to expand the overall park quality measurement by incorporating both objective and subjective park attributes from multiple aspects, and explored their associations with social interactive behaviors assessed through an established protocol. A case study in Utah was conducted to assess the relationships between both overall and separate park qualities and social interaction through hierarchical linear models (HLMs). The results indicated overall park quality was the most significant predictor of social interaction, followed by sub-areas, including green space and playground, and park size. Aesthetic features, maintenance and cleanliness can promote social interaction while numbers of facilities and amenities didn't show effects. The subjective attributes of park environment are more effective in influencing social interaction than the objectives. To assist municipal planners and policy makers to create socially harmonious and cohesive communities in various cities, we provided a general design guideline to encourage social interaction and promote health benefits through the enhancement of urban park quality.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Exploring associations between social interaction and urban park attributes: Design guideline for both overall and separate park quality enhancement' is highly relevant to the claim that 'Urban green spaces enhance community well-being,' as it provides empirical evidence linking urban parks and social interaction, which is a key component of community well-being. The authors investigate how various park attributes influence social interaction, which is crucial because active social engagement in public spaces can lead to enhanced mental health, increased feelings of safety, and a stronger sense of community. The study finds that improvements in overall park quality significantly promote social interaction, which in turn supports the notion that well-designed urban green spaces contribute positively to community well-being. \n\nIn terms of methodology, the paper employs a mixed-methods approach by integrating both qualitative and quantitative data, making use of surveys and observational studies across different parks. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of how various park attributes, such as aesthetics and maintenance, impact user interaction. By focusing on these measurable aspects, the authors provide quality evidence supporting their claims. The systematic collection of information regarding user behaviors and preferences lends credibility to their conclusions. The research also implements an established protocol for assessing park quality, which enhances the reliability of the results.\n\nThe findings are significant, suggesting that park attributes like cleanliness, aesthetics, and specific areas designed for play contribute to higher social interaction levels, thereby fostering community connections. This has implications for urban planning and public health, as it indicates that investing in high-quality green spaces not only meets recreational needs but also enhances social cohesion among citizens. The study concludes with actionable design guidelines that can inform future park development, which is essential for city planners aiming to enhance community well-being through strategic urban green space initiatives.\n\nHowever, the paper does acknowledge certain limitations. It primarily focuses on local parks within specific urban contexts, which may not be generalizable across different regions or cultural contexts. Furthermore, potential biases could arise from self-reported data from park users, as individuals may overestimate their social interactions in these spaces. The selective nature of the park attributes investigated may also overlook other critical factors affecting community well-being, such as accessibility, safety, or inclusive design aspects. Thus, while the findings are grounded in strong data, urban planners should consider these limitations when interpreting the results and implementing changes based on this study."

It is located near the foothills of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas in Northwest India and is independent India’s first planned. Planning along the lines of Garden City concept, Le Corbusier envisioned the periphery to be a large green space whose agriculture would support the city and the city in turn would generate employment for the local people. In the last four decades, the towns of Panchkula and Mohali have grown around Chandigarh not only in terms of population but have spread in area too turning it into a vast and economically vibrant region. Even though the green cover within the city limits of Chandigarh have been maintained, the rapid urbanisation of the periphery especially since after 2008 has been impacting the periphery area.\nClimate change and increasing urbanization will exacerbate the temperatures in the urban areas creating heat islands. Green spaces can play a significant role in the complex urban ecosystems. Green spaces in urban areas in form of parks, green roofs and walls and road-side trees can reduce the temperature.\nSmartness of a space lies in its aesthetics and attractiveness, healthy environment, ability to create social cohesion and economic viability. These spaces benefit the communities directly and indirectly from aesthetics, environment, recreation and economic standpoints. At the same time urban areas can accrue the benefits of mitigating air pollution and revive the fast depleting biodiversity habitats.\n2\nEvolution of Chandigarh and Its Region\nChandigarh derives its name from the temple of Goddess ‘Chandi’\nFootnote\n1\nand ‘garh’\nFootnote\n2\nthat lay beyond the temple. The gently sloping plains where present day city of Chandigarh exists, was in the ancient past, a wide lake ringed by a marsh [\n3\n]. The fossil remains found at the site indicate a large variety of aquatic and amphibian life. The area was also known to be a home to the Harappans during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Since the medieval through modern era, the area was part of the large and prosperous Punjab Province, which was divided into East and West Punjab during partition of the country in 1947. Established immediately after Independence, the city was conceived not only to serve as the capital of Punjab, but also to resettle thousands of refugees who had been uprooted from West Punjab (in present day Pakistan) [\n3\n].\nIn March 1948, the Government of the then erstwhile Punjab, in consultation with the Government of India, approved a 114.59 km\n2\n(11,459 ha) area at the foothills of Shivaliks as the site for the new capital. The site selected by Dr. M. S. Randhawa, the then Deputy Commissioner of Ambala was a part of the erstwhile Ambala district as per the 1892–93 Gazetteer of District Ambala [\n4\n]. Chandigarh was designed for a population of five lakhs and density of approximately 4400 persons per Sq. km (44 persons per hectare) [\n5\n]. Subsequently, with the reorganization of the erstwhile State of Punjab in 1966 into present day Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, the city of Chandigarh assumed the unique distinction of being the capital of two states, Punjab and Haryana. The city was declared as a Union Territory and put under the direct administrative control of the Central Government.\nChandigarh is symbolic as the first city that was planned in independent India. Planned on modernist thinking,\nFootnote\n3\nthe then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned the new city to represent free India. Albert Meyer, an American planner and architect, was hired in 1949 to formulate the plan of Chandigarh city. Mayer developed a superblock\nFootnote\n4\nbased-city threaded with green spaces which emphasized the cellular neighborhood and traffic segregation. The site had certain inherent landscape feature, which were fully retained as well as integrated into the plan like the gentle grade was used to promote the drainage and rivers to orient the plan [\n8\n] (Refer Fig.\n1\n).\nFig. 1\nSource\nMayer [\n9\n]\nChandigarh city plan by Albert Mayer.\nFull size image\nThe natural features of the site consisted of the panoramic range of the Shivalik Hills, the gently sloping land form from the North-East to the South-West, seasonal rivulets on its north-western and south-eastern flanks; and an eroded valley with a small nallah\nFootnote\n5\nrunning through the centre [\n8\n].\nThe conceptual design was further detailed by young architect, Mathew Nowicki in Mayer’s team, who gave it a touch of artistry and monumentality as he synthesised it into a simple pattern ‘The leaf’, bringing in the element of sensitization towards the environment and ecology from the inception into the plan (Refer Fig.\n2\n).\nFig. 2\nSource\nMayer [\n9\n]\nThe ‘leaf plan’ of Chandigarh conceptualised by Mathew Novicki.\nFull size image\nDue to untimely death of the Nowicki, Le Corbusier, a swiss-french architect and urban planner, was appointed to complete the design for the capital city. He had a repute of being the forefather of the Modernist architectural. Corbusier’s approach to planning was to create a scientifically rational and comprehensive solution to urban problems in a way that would both promote democracy and quality of life [\n11\n]. Based on the principles of scientific rationalism, efficiency, and social improvement through design, new ideas of mass production and democracy inspired his vision of the built environment. These manifested in planning and architecture through the use of minimal ornamentation, repetitive units, high rise structures, and separation of land use and zoning.\nCity plan was modified from one with a curving road network to rectangular shape with a grid iron pattern for the fast traffic roads, besides reducing its area for reason of economy. The city plan was conceived as post war Garden City\nFootnote\n6\nwherein vertical and high rise buildings were ruled out, keeping in view the socio economic-conditions and living habits of the people.\nThe city was conceptualized as an urban organism with its major functions: living, working, care of the body and spirit and circulation, being equated with different parts of human body. Neighborhood called a sector was rectangular in shape of about one square kilometer each which defined its basic unit. Le Corbusier planned the Capitol Complex at the top of Chandigarh city resembling the head; the intellectual base, reflecting his conviction that governance should begin here as the head rules the body. Residential sector constituted the living part whereas the Capitol Complex, city centre, Educational Zone (Post Graduate Institute, Punjab Engineering College and Punjab University) and the Industrial Area constitute the working part. The Leisure Valley, Gardens, Sector Greens and Open Courtyards were designed to represent the care of body and spirit. The circulation system comprised of 7 different types of roads known as 7 Vs. Subsequently, pathways for cyclists called V8 were added to the circulation system [\n8\n]. Combining modernity with ecology, 8 km long linear-park was planned running through the city from its north eastern tip to its south-western end forming the city level urban green.\nCorbusier’s design of an integrated system of seven roads was to ensure efficient traffic circulation. The city’s vertical roads run northeast/southwest known in local language as ‘path’ and the horizontal roads run northwest/southeast known as ‘marg’. These intersect at right angles, forming a grid of network for movement. This arrangement of road-use has led to a hierarchy of movement, which also ensures that the residential areas are segregated from the noise and pollution of traffic [\n8\n].\nThe work place of the city, the industrial area comprised of 2.35 km\n2\n, is located in the extreme southeastern side near the railway line. The location of the industrial areas was in conjunction with the prevalent wind direction of the area, which is north, north west. The area has been allocated and planned for non-polluting and light industry and is directly connected to the civic centre by a V-3 road. A wide buffer of fruit trees has been planted to screen off the industrial area from the rest of the city. Tree plantation and landscaping has been an integral part of the city’s Plan. Twenty-six different types of flowering and twenty-two species of evergreen trees [\n3\n] all over the city help to ameliorate the harsh climate of the region, especially the hot and scorching summers.\n3\nNatural Conditions of Chandigarh\nChandigarh experiences cold dry winder, hot summer and sub-tropical monsoon. Evaporation usually exceeds precipitation and the weather is generally dry. The city experiences four seasons: summer or hot season from mid-March to mid-June, rainy season from late June to mid-September, post monsoon Autumn from mid-September to mid-November and winter from mid-November to mid-March. The dry spell of summer is long but with occasional drizzles and thunderstorms. May and June are the hottest months of the year with mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures being about 40 and 25 °C, respectively. Southwest monsoons bring high intensity showers in late June and July. The weather at that time is hot and humid. January is the coldest month with mean maximum and minimum temperatures being around 24 and 1.8 °C respectively [\n13\n].\n3.1\nTemperature\nThe hot season lasts for two and a half months, from April end to beginning of July, with an average daily high temperature above 36 °C. The hottest days of the year are in May, with an average high of 41 °C and low of 27 °C.\nThe cool season too lasts for two and a half months, from December to middle of February, with an average daily high temperature below 23 °C. The coldest days of the year are in January, with an average low of 8 °C and high of 20 °C [\n13\n].\n3.2\nClouds\nThe average percentage of cloud cover, that is the sky covered by clouds, in Chandigarh varies significantly by season. The clearer part of the year in begins towards the end of August and lasts for about three and a half months until middle of December. The month of September experiences the clearest skies. The cloudier part of the year begins around middle of December and lasts for about eight and a half months. The month of July is the cloudiest day of the year.\n3.3\nPrecipitation\nA wet day is one with at least one millimeter of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. The chance of wet days in Chandigarh varies very significantly throughout the year. The wetter season lasts three months, from middle of June to middle September. The wettest month being July. The drier season lasts nine months, from middle of September to middle of June, November being the driest month.\n3.4\nRainfall\nChandigarh experiences extreme seasonal variation in monthly rainfall. The rainy period of the year lasts for 10 months, from middle of December to middle of October. Most rainfall is during July and August, averaging at 220 mm. The rainless period of the year lasts for two months, from middle of October to middle of December. The least rain falls in November, with an average total accumulation of 5 mm [\n8\n].\n3.5\nSun\nThe length of the day varies significantly over the course of the year in Chandigarh. The shortest day and the longest day coincides with the winter and summer solstice. Summer solstice giving the region the long daylight time of 14 h and winter solstice giving the shortest daylight time of only 10 h.\n3.6\nHumidity\nChandigarh experiences extreme seasonal variation in the perceived humidity. The comfort level of humidity is dependent on the dew point, determined by the evaporation of the perspiration from the skin. Lower dew point feels drier and higher dew point feels humid. The humid period of the year lasts about three and a half months from middle of June to beginning of October, August being the most humid.\n3.7\nWind\nThe average hourly wind speed in the city experiences significant seasonal variation. The windier period is from middle of January to end of June with average wind speed of 10 km per hour. The calmer month experience about 6 km per hour of wind speed [\n8\n].\nThe predominant wind direction is north and northwest. Seven months of the year experience the north wind and three months experience the west wind.\n3.8\nTopography\nChandigarh lies at an elevation of 1053 feet (321 m) above mean sea level. The topography within 3 km has modest variations in elevation with maximum elevation change of 50 m. This change within 15 km is about 100 m. This variation is significant within 100 km at about 3000 m.\n90% of the area within 3 km of Chandigarh is covered in artificial surface, within 10 km is 65% of the area is under agricultural land and 20% under artificial surface. This increases to 76% under agricultural land and 12% under trees within 100 km [\n8\n,\n13\n].\nWhile planning the city of Chandigarh, the natural and climatic conditions of the region have been accounted for. The placement of the principal functions has been based on the climatic conditions and the gradient of the land, like the industries have been located considering the prevalent wind direction. The alignment of the roads, which is in the grid form is in conjunction with the prevalent wind direction as well.\n4\nLand Use Through the Development Plans\nThe economic constraints led the master plan to be implemented in two phases, catering to a total population of half a million (five lakhs). Phase-I consisting of 30 low density sector spread over an area of 36.42 km\n2\n(Sector 1–30) for 150,000 people whereas Phase-II consisting of 17 considerably high density sectors (Sectors 31–47) spread over an area of 24.28 km\n2\nfor a population of 350,000 [\n8\n].\nChandigarh city is under the administration of Union Territory of Chandigarh. The planning functions of the city are undertaken by the Urban Planning Department and the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh manages the provision and maintenance of services and amenities within the municipal area.\nThe area of the Municipal Corporation is 79.74 km\n2\nout of 114 km\n2\n[\n14\n]. With regards the existing land use (including the extension areas of the city) about 38% of area is categorized as residential and 5% as commercial and a significant 8% each is assigned towards forests. On the other hand, the proportion of public and semi-public use land constitutes 11% and transportation land constitutes only 7% of the total area (Table\n1\n).\nTable 1 Existing and proposed land use classification, 2014 and 2031\nFull size table\nWhile planning the city of Chandigarh, every emphasis has been laid for providing green spaces, throughout the city. The open space per capita in the city was 82 m\n2\nin the early stages of development [\n8\n] With the subsequent increase in population, the per capita green spaces in the city came down to 56 m\n2\nin 2010, which is still quite high as compared to 21.43 m\n2\nper capita in the Delhi. Whereas, in Gandhinagar, another post-independence planned city of India the green cover is 164 m\n2\nper capita [\n15\n]. In the new cities that have been recently planned, Naya Raipur and Amravati, the green cover has been designated at 27 and 53% of the total area [\n15\n].\nThe city of Chandigarh was planned with the city at the core and agricultural area in the periphery. In order to enforce the vision of the Plan, Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act was enacted in 1952 to ensure that no haphazard development in the periphery of the planned city.\n5\nChandigarh Periphery Control Act\nHoward Ebenezer, in his model of Garden City, attempted to plan for both the town and country. The agricultural green belt was an essential element of the Garden City concept. Realizing that development is continuous, Ebenezer also envisioned satellite cities developing around a central city. The satellite cities were contained cities with their own green belts. He advocated the idea of ensuring the continuity of the rural green character of the countryside around the urban, grey landscape of a city despite controlled developments. His ideas found form in the shape of the Greater London plan of 1944 which provided for a green belt of 8 km all around the city to contain the sprawl of London [\n12\n].\nPlanning along the same lines so as to maintain the aesthetic of the new City, Le Corbusier envisioned the periphery to be a large green space whose agriculture would support the city. He emphasized that the agriculture on the periphery would support the city and the city in turn would generate employment for the local people (Fig.\n3\n).\nFig. 3\nSource\nHoward [\n16\n]\nThe Garden City concept.\nFull size image\nThe city of Chandigarh as planned was spread over 114 km\n2\n. The city that formed the core was to be surrounded by agriculturally dominant area spread over 1500 km\n2\n. This was a 16 km buffer extending from the outer boundary of the area acquired for Chandigarh (Refer Fig.\n4\n).\nFig. 4\nSource\nDeveloped by authors from Chandigarh Master plan 2031\nChandigarh capital periphery boundary.\nFull size image\n5.1\nThe Act\nIn order to enforce the implementation of the vision of an agriculturally dominant periphery, the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 popularly known as the Chandigarh Periphery Controlled Act was established in 1952. Its objective was to prevent mushrooming of unplanned construction around the new city. The Periphery Control Act was created to regulate the use of land and prevent unauthorized urbanization within 8 km. A controlled periphery around the new capital was proposed to serve as much as a green envelope, as a buffer separating the new capital from the indigenous urban expression all around [\n17\n].\n5.2\nThe Purpose\nAt the time of conceptualization, the rationale of the said Act was to protect the surrounding rural community from getting urbanised, to prevent the growth of slum like inhabitations, to freeze the land use in the demarcated boundary, and to stop conversion of agricultural\nFootnote\n7\nland into uses other than agriculture or subservient to agriculture [\n17\n]. Another purpose of the Periphery was to provide locally available building material (from brick kilns) for the construction of the city [\n17\n].\n5.3\nViolations to the Act\nHowever, there emerged gaps between what was visualized and what came up as the Chandigarh grew. Development is largely guided by the political and economic factors that are highly unpredictable and dynamic in nature. The time gap between planning and development leads to unforeseen realities which has been the case of Chandigarh and its Periphery.\nViolation to The Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 started in 1962 with the establishment of Army Cantonment at Chandimandir, Air Force Station and Hindustan Machine Tools factory within the periphery. In the same year, the periphery control area was extended from 8 to 16 km through an amendment to the Act. These establishments were considered essential and were not deemed to be violations of the Act as such.\nIn 1966 the state of Punjab was divided into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Chandigarh continued to be the capital of the states of Haryana and Punjab and was made the Union Territory under the direct administrative control of the central government. The Union Territory of Chandigarh comprised of 114 km\n2\n, 70 km\n2\nunder the city limits and 44 km\n2\nin the Periphery area. 1021 km\n2\nof the periphery area came under Punjab and 295 km\n2\nunder Haryana. At the time of state reorganisation, in 1966, only 3% of the controlled area came under Chandigarh, 23% went with Haryana and 74% fell under Punjab control. It had a population of 1.04 million in 2001 spread across 458 villages and 12 urban centres [\n5\n].\nSoon after the reorganization of the states, townships were established by respective state governments in areas adjoining Chandigarh. The state of Punjab set up a 22 km\n2\ntown of Mohali towards south west while Government of Haryana set up a 20 km\n2\nurban area of Panchkula towards south east. The establishment of these towns was in violation to the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952. The towns of Mohali and Panchkula have over the years developed a unique relation with Chandigarh city at the core. Panchkula bordering Chandigarh on the southeast functioned as a big service center. In Mohali, industrial impetus was given which has led to the growth of present day town spread across 22 km\n2\n.\nIn 1975, a high powered co-ordination committee was constituted under the then Ministry of Urban Development which in 1977 led to the formulation of Chandigarh Urban Complex Plan consisting of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula comprising of 330 km\n2\n. The three cities are popularly known as Tri-City.\nIn 1984, Chandigarh Interstate Regional Plan was prepared by Town and Country Planning Organisation, New Delhi for an area of 2431 km\n2\nfor a population of 25 lakhs [\n8\n] (Refer Fig.\n5\n).\nFig. 5\nSource\nDeveloped by authors with inputs from Chandigarh Interstate Regional Plan\nSpatial spread of Chandigarh metropolitan region.\nFull size image\nIn 1990, Punjab Government declared an area of 40 km\n2\nto be a Free Enterprise Zone (FEZ) in Dera Bassi Tehsil of Patiala District [\n18\n] (now part of SAS Nagar District), where the setting up of industries was to be permitted. This further undermined the power of the Periphery Act.\nIn 1998, Punjab Government decided to pass a regulation for an over-arching regularization of all existing unauthorized constructions, as well as permitting the future construction of educational and health institutions [\n19\n]. This move by the government resulted in mushrooming of educational institutes on the outskirts of the urban area along the main roads and highways. The states of Punjab and Haryana had themselves violated the green buffer the by developing the townships of Panchkula, Mohali and Zirakpur. In 1999, Chandigarh Interstate Metropolitan Regional Plan was to be prepared for a 50 km radii [\n8\n].\nIn order to capitalise on the new wave of urbanisation, especially in the tier II and III towns, the Government of Punjab notified Greater Mohali Area Development Authority Regional Plan 2056 covering an area of 1021 km\n2\nwhich is the periphery area of Chandigarh falling within the jurisdiction of Punjab. Subsequently, Haryana government added approximately 6 km\n2\nof area to Panchkula Development Plan [\n8\n,\n20\n].\nThere have been numerous violations to the Act. In the last four decades, the towns of Panchkula and Mohali have grown around Chandigarh not only in terms of population but have spread in area too turning it into a vast and economically vibrant region. These developments by the state government took place in the city’s greenbelt, an area under green activities like agriculture and trees. The controlled area gradually became uncontrolled. Punjab and Haryana governments instead of protecting the green belt established satellite towns adjacent to Chandigarh to benefit from the economic opportunities provided by it. The Periphery Control Act which was notified in order to ensure the sustainability of rural landscape around Chandigarh, due to economic and developmental pressures failed to do so. Increasing urbanization and sprawl impacted the environment of the region.\n6\nGreen Spaces in Urban Area\nUrban green space is a component of ‘green infrastructure’, that comprises of all urban land covered by vegetation of any kind. This covers vegetation on private and public grounds, irrespective of size and function, and can also include small water bodies such as ponds, lakes or streams which are known as the ‘blue spaces’ [\n21\n]. In the context of Chandigarh, all of the area within the Periphery Boundary as per the Punjab Capital Periphery Control Act. 1952 is being considered as the study area, hence includes the area under agricultural activities as Green Space.\nGreen spaces in cities are considered a crucial factor for realizing environmental quality goals, which are within the SDG Goal 11 of making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. A target of the Goal is to provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities [\n22\n]. The SDGs have been formulated very recently, in 2016. The importance of Green Spaces in and around the city which emanated from the need of improving the health and providing better housing conditions during the industrial era, has been realized a s a prerequisite by the Planners from the most initial stages.\n6.1\nBenefits of Green Spaces\nBenefits of Green Spaces are numerous. Direct benefits of green spaces are reduction in energy consumption, ground water recharge, protection of lakes and streams from polluted runoff, reduced soil erosion, rainfall retention, water quality protection, reduced heat island effect and lesser overall temperatures.\nAn indirect benefit of urban green areas is a decrease in the crime rates of the area which has been substantiated by a study conducted in Philadelphia where it was found that areas where grass, trees and shrubs were found, crime rates, especially robberies and assaults were lesser [\n23\n]. This has been corroborated by another study that the presence of large street trees was most important in reducing rates of crime [\n24\n]. Green cover in an area is an indicator of the neighborhood being cared for and hence creating a perception in the mind of the criminal that he may be watched.\nIt has been observed by the UW-Madison Department of Urban and Regional Planning [\n25\n] that the urban green spaces are helping in regulating the climate and air quality as well as reducing the energy consumption and in turn are recharging the groundwater. Wolf observed in 2004 that the trees in a parking lot can reduce on-site heat buildup, decrease runoff and enhance night time cool downs. Tests in a mall parking lot in Huntsville, Alabama showed a 31° difference between shaded and unshaded areas. There are evidences that green cover modifies temperatures and in turn reduces the amount of fossil fuel used for cooling and heating. Properly placed deciduous trees reduce house temperatures in the summer, allowing air conditioning units to run 2–4% more efficiently [\n26\n].\n6.1.1\nRooftop Green Spaces Reduce Urban Heat Island Effect\nThe urban heat island effect is a term used to describe the hotter temperatures found in cities compared to rural areas within the same region. Human activities increase the temperature within cities, and with a reduction in greenery there is little natural cooling. An excellent way to combat this is to turn rooftops into green spaces or green/living roofs. Planted roofs are exceptionally effective at reducing environmental heat as well as provide greater energy-efficiency within the building itself.\n6.1.2\nGreater Energy Conservation\nNot only does an increase in green space directly affect the building it surrounds or is on (in the case of green roofs), but they also contribute to energy conservation to the city as whole. By reducing temperatures naturally and helping to bring down air temperature, buildings’ HVAC systems can run at a slightly lower power. This is especially true for residential neighborhoods which may see up to a 4% increase in AC efficiency when trees are properly planted to block sunlight in the hottest parts of the day [\n27\n].\n6.1.3\nNatural Reduction in Noise Pollution\nNoise pollution in the form of nearby industrial buildings or busy roads and highways can naturally be buffered by green spaces. Strategic planting of shrubs and trees are a way to not only enhance the surrounding areas but also help protect people from unpleasant, disruptive noise.\nEnclosed green spaces may not actually be such a bad idea, especially for green spaces around office buildings where the area functions as a place for employees to relax. Noise pollution in densely populated areas within a city can be quieted by the use of insulated concrete walls surrounding green spaces, even if only as a single wall barrier alongside a busy highway adjacent to the space [\n27\n].\n6.1.4\nImproved Air Quality\nAir pollution is a serious issue in many big cities that are densely populated. It is fairly common knowledge that plants clean the air, a primary reason why so many homeowners enjoy their houseplants. On a larger scale, green spaces with trees and shrubs are an ideal way of naturally cleansing the air.\n6.1.5\nErosion and Runoff Control\nWater and wind erosion cause sediment to seep into bodies of water, storm drains, and roads. When erosion occurs in an urban setting it can easily lead to flooding, mudslides, and dust storms. A densely planted green space is the natural way of reducing erosion. A well-planted green space will also help prevent nutrient loss in the soil, which can still occur in poorly planted spaces.\n6.1.6\nPromotes a More Active Lifestyle\nNumerous studies have concluded that access to more green space also increases the population’s activity level. A major factor in the struggle of obesity is regular exercise, a problem only made worse within cities with little access to parks and similar open spaces. Simple observational research shows people living in greener areas are more active. This is especially true for children, as majority of the physical activity in childhood outside of the school playground is in parks [\n27\n].\n6.1.7\nEffectively Helps Prevent Disease and Ease Mental Illness Symptoms\nNot only does being in a green space help with the healing process, both physically and mentally, but it also works towards preventing diseases like Alzheimer’s and Dementia. It comes as no surprise that more and more hospitals and similar healthcare buildings are creating “healing gardens”, green spaces where patients can visit and relax. Green spaces also help with mental conditions like ADHD (particularly in children) as well as insomnia, depression, anxiety, and chronic stress [\n27\n].\nThere is a plethora of different benefits associated with adding more greenery to cities. As the concern over climate change and human adaption to these changes continues, the practice of bringing more of nature back into our urban areas is need of the hour. Empirical studies indicate multiple approach towards green Infrastructure (Table\n2\n).\nTable 2 Infrastructure approaches to environmental sustainability\nFull size table\n6.2\nUrban Green Spaces Around the World\nThere are a number of cities around the world which have shown that planning of urban areas can be environment friendly. The most livable cities are as known for their open space, have a large core area as open green public space. Hyde Park in London, Central Park in New York, the Bukit Timah Nature Preserve in Singapore, Phoenix Park in Dublin are some such examples functioning as the lungs of the cities. Curitiba, a Brazilian city of a population of 1.8 million people consumes 23% less fuel per capita than the Brazilian national average. The city has 16 parks, 14 forests, and over 1000 green public areas shared by its residents [\n28\n].\nIndian examples are Sanjay Gandhi Van in Mumbai, The Ridge in Delhi, and Nandan Van in Naya Raipur apart from cities of Bangalore, Gandhinagar and Jaipur.\n6.2.1\nSan Diego Forward: The Regional Plan (2019–2050)\nThe goals of the Regional Plan of San Diego are to provide innovative mobility choices and planning to support a sustainable and healthy region, a vibrant economy, and an outstanding quality of life for all. The Regional Plan identified smart growth and sustainable development as important strategies to direct the region’s future growth toward compact, mixed-use development in urbanized communities that already have existing and planned infrastructure, and then connecting those communities with a variety of transportation choices. In 2008, the San Diego region included about 3.1 million people forecasted to increase by 1.25 million people by 2050 [\n30\n].\nThe San Diego region has made significant changes in the approach to planning in planning for more compact, higher density, and walkable development in order to protect the open spaces in the region. The natural environment in the San Diego region includes three general geographic areas: the coast, the mountains, and the desert (Fig.\n6\n).\nFig. 6\nSource\nRegional plan SANDAG [\n30\n]\nProposed land use 2020 San Diego region.\nFull size image\nThe San Diego Region open space strategy has been developed on the principles of sustainability and smart growth. The Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) land use pattern also protects and preserves about 1.3 million acres of land, more than half the region’s land area. SANDAG has defined regionally significant open space to include: region-defining open space, natural resource areas, region-serving open space, and rural lands [\n30\n]. These areas include parks, steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands, and habitat of native plants and animals.\nRegion-serving open space are areas lightly developed with activities or facilities that serve the region as unique or outstanding recreational, safety or managed production (agriculture, mineral extraction). These areas are retained as open space and, in some cases, increased to serve the region’s expanding needs. Additionally, corridors of open space within and between communities are retained in order to provide identity and a sense of community, and to link significant open space areas.\nRural lands are areas outside the identified urban area that are planned to remain in a low intensity, rural land use pattern. These areas provide a contrast to complete urbanization and result in the visual appearance and feeling of more openness in the region.\nThe Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP), administered by the Division of Land Resource Protection at the California Department of Conservation, produces maps and statistical data to analyse impacts to California’s agricultural resources [\n30\n]. To characterize existing and potential farmland, agricultural lands are rated according to soil quality and irrigation status FMMP maps are updated every two years using aerial photographs, a geographic information system, public review, and field reconnaissance.\nThe goal is to assure that adequate quantities of diverse habitat types are maintained, and that the plants and animals found in these habitats are less likely to become endangered. The regional habitat conservation plans in the San Diego region are designed to provide an umbrella of protection for multiple species by conserving their habitats and the linkages that allow them to travel between habitats [\n30\n].\nThe State of California has initiated a habitat conservation planning process that concentrates on the conservation of large parcels of land and emphasizes planning for environmental systems. The Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP) program pilot effort focuses on the coastal sage scrub habitat of the coastal California gnatcatcher in Southern California. The program is designed to address a habitat type of several species.\nAs part of the SANDAG participation in planning for the conservation of regional habitats, SANDAG developed a database of conserved lands in 2010 (SANDAG Conserved Lands database, 2010). This database, which is regularly updated and available to the public, serves as the basis for monitoring habitat conservation [\n30\n].\nThe SCS land use pattern incorporates finalized habitat plans as well as the conservation of other sensitive resource lands as reflected in plans by local jurisdictions. These local and regional plans ensure the conservation of plant and animal species, and natural habitats through low density zoning, conservation easements, and land purchases.\n6.3\nGreen Spaces as Per URDPFI Guidelines\nURDPFI Guidelines [\n31\n] define the open spaces as recreational spaces, organised greens and other common spaces such as vacant lands/open spaces including flood plains, forest cover in plan areas. The Guidelines prescribe 10–12 m\n2\nper person of open space. These norms are over and above the protected zones, ecological conservative areas in the hilly regions. A hierarchy of green spaces is prescribed consisting of parks, play fields, other open spaces (Refer Table\n3\n).\nTable 3 Hierarchy of open spaces\nFull size table\nIn case of Chandigarh, The Green Space have been planned at each sector level in the form of neighbourhood parks and playgrounds. There are a series of community spaces and city level parks live Rose Garden and Rock Garden. The hierarchy of services as stated in the Guidelines has been followed in case of Chandigarh.\n6.4\nGreen Spaces in Chandigarh City\nThe concept of urban green parks can be traced back to 19th century for promoting well-being in new industrialised cities. Importance of green spaces for the well-being of humans has been well established through many researches, especially after the World War II. In concurrence with thought, Corbusier kept the provision of large number of open spaces, green belts, city parks and neighborhood parks in Chandigarh right from the beginning. There exists well-structured and order in the hierarchy of open spaces in the city ranging from the neighborhood level to the city level. The major principle which guided the formulation of Chandigarh’s landscape design was that its original topography has to be retained and integrated [\n8\n]. Provision of green spaces in each sector were basically meant to provide lungs to the area and for developing areas of leisure. Unlike other Indian cities the green areas in the Chandigarh city are planned within each sector, which is the neighbourhood level (Fig.\n7\n).\nFig. 7\nSource\nChandigarh Master Plan 2031 [\n8\n]\nGreen Spaces in Chandigarh city.\nFull size image\nAdditionally, green open spaces are available either in the form of private housing, schools, colleges or other institutional large campuses such as Punjab Engineering College, Punjab University; over and above the planned green areas in the city layout, contribute as much as the overall city greenery and open spaces.\nAnother legacy of the city’s green identity is the establishment of long clear cut vistas created in the first phase of the city connecting the residents to the skyline of the hills through continuous green spaces such as sector greens, Leisure Valley and Sukhna Lake promenade. As tree plantation and landscaping has been an integral part of the city’s Master plan, the city’s green cover rose from 21% in 1991, 29.3% in 2003 to 35.7% in 2007 as per Forest Survey of India’s Report 2007 [\n33\n]. The per capita green space availability in the city presently is around 54.45 m\n2\nwhich is better than most of the European cities [\n34\n].\nThe most peculiar feature of the city’s landscaping is the tree planting along roads, open spaces, green belts and around building complexes. The road plantations were based on study of the movement of sun in relation to direction, scale, size and architecture along avenues. To minimize glare along the avenues running north-east to south-west, dense foliage evergreen trees like Ficus infectoria\nFootnote\n8\nand Schleichera oleosa\nFootnote\n9\nwere planted to form green tunnels. The shopping streets were planted with flowering species like Cassia fistula,\nFootnote\n10\nCassia javanica\nFootnote\n11\nand Jacaranda\nFootnote\n12\nspecies [\n35\n].\n6.5\nGreen Spaces in Chandigarh’s Periphery\nPrior to the siting of Chandigarh, the Periphery was characterized by an agrarian landscape of rural villages, farmland and forested areas [\n20\n]. Le Corbusier sought to maintain this functioning rural landscape by creating an agricultural greenbelt circumscribing the urban core of Chandigarh. As stated in Sect.\n6\nthe Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 was enacted soon after the preparation of the Master Plan, to help implement this vision by restricting urban development, but despite its existence, the Periphery has seen rapid land use change.\nThe landscape of the Periphery is made of four different geographical features; the Himalaya, the gravel upland (Dun), Shivalik Hills, the rolling plain at the base of the foothills (Ghar), and the Chandigarh alluvial plain [\n35\n] (Refer Fig.\n8\n).\nFig. 8\nSource\nWeber Abigail, within the edge: a revised approach to urban containment within Chandigarh periphery [\n35\n]\nNatural features in Chandigarh periphery area.\nFull size image\nEach of these features of the natural environment contributes to the rural way of life. This interconnected ecosystem has been significantly impacted by the development on the Periphery. The natural areas are at risk of depletion under the threat of urbanization, therefore impacting the rural lifestyle.\nThe majority of the Periphery is made up of Chandigarh Alluvial Plain, located at the foot of the Shivalik Hills on a gentle southwestern slope. The plains are an important feature of the Periphery as they provide fertile soil for agriculture. The Shivalik Hills are located to the northeast of Chandigarh, running parallel to the Himalayan Mountains. Patialia-Ki-Rao and Suhkna Choe are the main seasonal streams flowing through the Periphery, previously referenced in Sect.\n3\nwere defining element of the Mayer Plan.\nThere are two reserve forests functioning to protect the Sukhna Lake catchment area, which fall within portions of Punjab, Haryana and the UT. Sukhna Lake is an artificial lake located to the southwest of the Shivalik Hills. The lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna and Kansal Choes, seasonal streams flowing from the Hills [\n3\n]. This catchment area is located within portions of Punjab, Haryana and the UT. The lake was a design feature in Le Corbusier’s Master Plan of Chandigarh (Refer Fig.\n9\n).\nFig. 9\nSource\nDeveloped by authors from Survey of India Toposheet sheet and Google Map\nDrainage network of Chandigarh.\nFull size image\nRural land within the Periphery Control Area was permitted to serve one of two uses intended to meet the day to-day needs of the residents of the urban core; agriculture or the production of building materials [\n20\n]. Land was designated as ‘agricultural and afforestation zone’, or a ‘brick field zone’ which included brick and lime kilns.\nActive agriculture and the rural village remain, but as urban development encroachments have been pushed further out into the Periphery. Villages in close proximity to Chandigarh have changed significantly, becoming visibly more urban in density and commercial activities.\nThe development of the satellite towns Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab paved the way for construction to proceed within the Periphery even before Chandigarh had reached its full capacity [\n20\n]. Increasing land values in Chandigarh drove people to these neighboring townships, or further out into the Periphery where urban services were not located. Unauthorized development began emerging in response to the rapid growth and demand for services, In Punjab, the Greater Mohali Area regional plan creates seven integrated Economic Hubs, while Haryana’s regional growth strategy incorporates five planned settlements [\n3\n].\nThis trend of master planned developments has emerged over the last decade. Throughout the Periphery township development, commercial establishments, mixed-use and academic campus came up. The magnitude of land use change is evident from the study of historical and contemporary Google Earth maps (Refer Fig.\n10\n). New developments have been permitted due to relaxed interpretations of the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 and jurisdictions continuing to justify new projects in the public interest. This rapid development reflects the large-scale shift from a primarily rural Periphery of agricultural activities to a Periphery of a mixed urban land uses and activities.\nFig. 10\nSource\nDeveloped by authors using Google Earth\nTemporal comparison of built up in chandigarh periphery area.\nFull size image\nThe built up area in the Periphery Control Area increased by more than 40% over the decade between 2000 and 2012 (Refer Table\n4\n).\nTable 4 Increase in the built up in periphery control area of Chandigarh\nFull size table\nIn Punjab sub region of Chandigarh Periphery Area, nearly all of the area has been notified under the Greater Mohali Metropolitan Area Regional Plan. Even though three areas have been demarcated within the sub-region, namely Primary Urban Development Area, Secondary Urban Development Area and Agriculture/Tourism/Rural Area, the whole sub-region is likely to grow into a huge urbanized area by 2058 (Refer Fig.\n11\n).\nFig. 11\nSource\nAdapted from Greater Mohali Regional Plan 2058\nProposed urbanisation by 2058 in Punjab sub region of periphery control area.\nFull size image\nIn Haryana sub region of Chandigarh Periphery Area, the built up area has increased at nearly 50 percent decadal rate (Refer Table\n5\nand Fig.\n12\n).\nTable 5 Land cover in the Haryana sub-region of Chandigarh periphery control area\nFull size table\nFig. 12\nSource\nLand use changes in Haryana sub-region of Chandigarh controlled area: a spatio-temporal study [\n36\n]\nProposed urbanisation in haryana sub region of periphery control area.\nFull size image\nThe on-the-ground reality is that the periphery of Chandigarh is developing in a manner directly counter to the act originally intended to preserve it as a permanent, functioning agricultural greenbelt.\nThe green cover that has been declining in the Chandigarh Periphery Area due to rapid urbanisation is leaving an impact on Chandigarh. There has been a notable increase in water logging within the city as well as increase in the surface temperature of the region [\n37\n].\nChandigarh has per capita urban green space of 54.45 m\n2\n[\n34\n], having more than 35% of its geographical area under forest and tree cover, making it one of the greenest cities of India [\n3\n]. Being a planned city, the green spaces are well integrated in the master plans. Similar strategies have been adopted in the satellite towns of Panchkula and Mohali.\nChandigarh is one of the fastest growing cities in the country, with a decadal growth rate of 40.30%, has the potential to become the I.T. city of Punjab and Haryana [\n13\n]. The city is witnessing a rapid expansion, industrial boom, increased trade opportunities coupled with high population growth rate accelerated due to migration from neighboring states as well as from U.P. and Bihar. Chandigarh is beset with increasing urban environmental problems due to the growth of unsustainable economic activities, increase in vehicular transport, in spite of a public transport system. The most pertinent concerns include air and noise pollution, depleting ground water and contamination of water bodies and lakes, destruction of natural and manmade resources of cultural value and improper management of domestic and industrial effluents. This situation is leading to depletion of green cover, groundwater table and rising levels of air and noise pollution both in the core and periphery area.\nIn the periphery area the forest cover is confined to hardly 14 villages out of a total of 458, four each in Punjab and Chandigarh Sub-zones of the Periphery Zone and six in Haryana Sub-zone. Most of these villages are located along different choes\nFootnote\n13\nflowing through the Periphery Zone Forest land in Haryana Sub-zone is more than two times that of Punjab and Chandigarh Sub-zones put together. Bir Ghaggar village in Haryana recorded 98% of its total area as forest. The number of villages with more than half of their land under forest cover declined from 11 in 1971 to 4 in 2001. The actual decrease here was from 8729 to 2105 ha [\n39\n].\nMohali and Panchkula are not satellite towns in its true essence as there needs to be an essential green belt between the core town and its satellites. However, in both the cases, there is a continuum of built up with the city of Chandigarh at its core (Fig.\n13\n).\nFig. 13\nSource\nLand use changes in Haryana sub-region of Chandigarh controlled area: a spatio-temporal study [\n36\n]\nForest depleted villages.\nFull size image\n7\nChallenges for Chandigarh Periphery Region\nThe region lacks a coordinated vision for Development as well as Protecting Open Spaces. In the case of Chandigarh, while Corbusier visualised the green spaces within the city in detail, however the same consideration was not extended to the periphery region by the states of Punjab and Haryana within whose aegis the area lies.\nWatershed-scale planning is critical as environmental systems are best analysed within a watershed framework, rather than within municipal boundaries. Water logging in Chandigarh city, but also in Mohali is a result of encroachment of development on seasonal ‘choes’ in the periphery region.\nMultiplicity of governance as the state government’s efforts to go for coordinated planned development were lacking. To resolve the multiplicity of governance the Government of India constituted a Coordination Committee, in 1966 to ensure continuity in policy toward the Periphery Zone. The Coordination Committee appointed two working groups one for preparation of the Regional Plan for Chandigarh Inter-State Region and the other for the framing of requisite legislation for its effective enforcement and implementation. However, none of these could be effective in preventing development in the Periphery Area.\nStress on natural resources in the region that is the two most noticeable features in the land use change in the Periphery Zone were the decrease in the forest area and increase in the share of land not available for cultivation. The forest cover got denuded by six per cent points and land not available for cultivation’ increased by 7% points during 1971–2001. The forest cover was completely wiped away from 42 out of 50 villages where it existed in 1971. This phenomenon was more typical of the villages falling in the Punjab and Chandigarh Sub-zones. The decline in the net sown area and cultivable wasteland was marginal during 1971–2001.\nMobility challenges in form of regional transport system accentuate the issues in the region. There exist links to provide an easy access to the people living in the periphery Area to commute to the city Core.\n8\nSmart City Chandigarh\nChandigarh was selected for the Smart City project in May 2016 out of 98 cities which are under the Smart City Project of Government of India. The central idea is to make use of technology and the advanced modes of lifestyle to optimize the living conditions in the selected cities under this program.\nThe vision statement for Chandigarh Smart City has been defined as to create a Vibrant and Unique Regional Centre. The City beautiful is envisioned to become leader in livability, sustainability, equality, and innovation [\n40\n]. The city proposal is to improve public life and safety, and liveability using two initiatives:\nSmart Integrated e-Governance\nIntelligent Multi-modal command and control center\nThe administration has decided on carrying out area-based development in sectors 17, 22, 35 and 43 on a pilot basis. Under the Smart projects-Smart water meters, smart grid, wi-fi spots, intelligent traffic management system, pedestrian pavements is what all the sectors would be provided with. Apart from these, there would be smart pipes that would be connected with a wireless processor to help detect leakage in real time, with a system of online monitoring of the entire distribution in place everywhere [\n40\n].\nFootpaths and cycling tracks will also be laid on roadsides all along the inter-sector roads as well as those leading to markets to encourage people to switch over to non-motorised transport. Traffic-sensing lights or smoother flow of traffic and lesser pollution, e-surveillance with CCTV cameras and sensors at every point to help in better traffic management is being planned for the city.\nChandigarh is among four cities which the French government has identified to invest in as part of the Indian government’s smart city project and has allocated as much as two billion Euros to be spent over the next few years.\n9\nChallenges for Integrating Smart Regional Environment\nOne of the major problems facing the city is the enormous population growth both of the city and that of the adjoining areas. There is also rapid increase in the floating population, which come to work, and avail of the services in the city.\nRoot cause of Chandigarh’s problems has been that Chandigarh planning and development has been seen in isolation compared to the development of its periphery and region. While Chandigarh is a planned city its peri-urban areas are neither rural nor urban. Le Corbusier’s tool of greenbelt for Urban containment was not effective. Le Corbusier viewed the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952 as a critical feature protecting his plan. In year 1966, after re-organization of state of Punjab, when Chandigarh became Union Territory (a centrally administered unit) with capital of two states of Punjab and Haryana and its periphery area got divided into three parts with majority of share going to state of Punjab and Haryana.\n10\nSmart Green Open Spaces Strategy\nIn the past few decades Chandigarh region have been seen struggling to maintain a balance between economic, environmental and social sustainability. It needs to be acknowledged that new challenges like affordable housing, economic generation have existed and dictated the current development pattern. The economic and developmental pressure is a reality, which the Punjab and Haryana Government has tried to cater to by developing new satellite towns. However, it cannot be denied that the overall vision for the region has been lacking and the development has taken place in phases due to which the green spaces in the region have been affected. The approach now, that needs to be advocated is preserving the existing green spaces in the region. This involves not developing new areas in the region that doesn’t have existing infrastructure service and preserve the open spaces in the region for ecological functions.\nThe smart green space strategy for the region should be based on the principles of growth management and green infrastructure (Refer Table\n2\n). Additionally, keeping the regional challenges in mind, the open spaces in the region should be planned and sensitive lands identified should be protected. There is a need to achieve a balance between the protection of agricultural lands and open spaces and the urban development to promotes smart and responsible growth.\nOverall strategy for open spaces needs to cover the following:\nPrepare the smart open green strategy keeping in mind the present situation and constraints\nImplement the strategy through a central authority with representatives of all involved governments and stakeholders\nAllocate responsibilities to respective state governments and local departments\nMonitor the progress against the set targets using smart tools\nReview action plan periodically\nReview and update the strategy if required.\n10.1\nChandigarh Region\nChandigarh city has been designed as greenfield city in India. The periphery of the City was visualized as buffer as a functional landscape that contains the growth of the city. However, the development of the satellite towns of Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab in Periphery area started even before Chandigarh reached its full potential of development. Increasing lands values in Chandigarh city and affordable options in the periphery drove this development. Resultantly, the rural villages in close proximity to Chandigarh have undergone significant changes. The rapid growth in the rural population can be attributed to in-migration between 1971–2001 due to economic opportunities being provided by Chandigarh city. Subsequently, Mohali and Panchkula, the satellite towns became the magnet.\nThe path of urbanisation in the region may not be reversible, however, measures can be taken by the authorities to ensure that the region is planned as a single entity maintaining the basic character and ethos of the Plan initially laid out by Le Corbusier.\nTo achieve the Green Space vision a four–point strategy has been proposed that is adopting a coordinated approach towards the planning of the Periphery and the Core; conserving and retaining the water and tree cover; adopting modern techniques of greening the region and basing the planning for the region on the principles of watershed.\nThe smart growth principles need to acknowledge the Periphery area as an integral feature of the historic master plan. Yet, at the same time the developmental pressure and sound economic opportunities for the region cannot be denied. Hence a new periphery area should be delineated keeping in mind to preserve and maintain the visualized heritage of Chandigarh. Strategies should discourage sprawl and further conversion of natural and agricultural land for urban development.\nFor meeting the development challenge two-fold approach should be adopted—one to use the existing developed area more efficiently and second to minimize the new urban centres in Chandigarh’s green belt. The periphery area needs to be visualized as an entity comprising of open spaces, agricultural lands, village settlements, urban development and planned accordingly.\n10.2\nProtection of Sensitive Lands in the Region\nA lot of effort went in selecting the site for Chandigarh city. The natural features of the selected site were incorporated in the design right from beginning. The ecological setting of the city was duly selected keeping in mind the vision for the city and the region. The landscape of the periphery comprises of distinct geographical features:\nThe Himalaya,\nShivalik Hills to the northwest that provided a backdrop, the gentle southern slope provided efficient drainage\nThe Chandigarh alluvial plain [\n35\n] at the base of the foothills\nHydrological features\nEach of these natural features plays an important ecosystem services. In the past, the infrastructural demands like road and rail transport networks, water treatment, sewage disposal, educational institutions, health centres and recreation sites have pressure on the land in the Periphery Zone thereby converting the area under cultivation, cultivable wasteland and forest, and bringing these under the urban development.\nThe seasonal water ‘choes’ in the region help in reducing runoff volumes and reduces peak flows by utilizing the natural retention and absorption capabilities of vegetation and soils. Due to development, some of them have encroached upon hampering the ecological function played by them. Conserving and retaining the water and tree cover; adopting modern techniques of greening the region and basing the planning for the region on the principles of watershed is recommended.\nThe open spaces in the region should be planned and sensitive lands identified should be protected as an integrated and connected system with different open spaces supporting one another to achieve multiple benefits. As stated by Kimmel [\n29\n], planning and decision making for vibrant and environmentally sustainable communities requires a systems perspective that integrates green and grey infrastructure. Additionally, there has to be a financing mechanism in place that funds the conservation plans and sensitive land protection in the periphery zone. Without funds and collective ownership, the area to be preserved will always face the threat of development.\nAs stated the Urban Green Areas do not have to be limited to parks on the ground but can extend to agricultural land as well as green roofs and walls. ‘Greens on Building’ that is green roofs and walls can increase the green cover specially in the core and dense urban areas with negligible land area for vegetation. These Greens in a Building not only play an important role in thermal insulation of the building itself, but also increase the water recharge and reduce runoff of precipitation into urban sewers.\nSome strategies for maintaining the green character of the region could be through adoption of smart laws that enforce ‘Greens on Buildings’ by creating green walls and roofs. The impact of this can be monitored through sensors and geospatial technology models can be generated to monitor the heat island effect. This will help the authorities in taking corrective measures to reduce the heat island effect.\n10.3\nPromote Collective Governance and Responsibility\nThe governance structure in the Chandigarh region is complex. The reorganization had negative implication for the periphery in terms of multiplicity of governance. Due to lack of interstate coordination, competing interest and differing interpretations of the language of the law, the reorganization made it particularly difficult to enforce a unified vision of the rural landscape within the Periphery [\n20\n].\nThere are multiple government in charge of different spatial segments of the region. In 1975, in response to the uncontained urban growth in the periphery the Central government formed a coordination committee for balanced development of the Chandigarh Region. Based on the recommendation of this committee, in 1984 ‘Inter State Chandigarh Regional Plan’ for 2001 was formulated. The Committee held numerous meetings and also formally obtained the comments of relevant Departments of the Government such as Revenue, Industries, Housing and Urban Development and Local Government [\n19\n]. The Committee lacked Statutory power and has remain ineffective as a result, the development taking place in periphery is lacking coordination and vision.\nGreen open space strategy cannot be separated from governance, as the process of planning involves a wide range of stakeholders and individual citizens. There is a need for emergence of a central regional authority with a vision as well as clear legal status, technical and professional capacity to plan and a robust administration to implement and enforce [\n41\n]. Additionally, not only State level coordination but there is a need to identify and support existing inter-agency and inter-municipal collaborations.\n10.4\nUse of Smart Tools Which Essentially Include Geospatial Technologies\nSmart tools which essentially include geospatial technologies encompassing remote sensing and GIS for the purpose of online monitoring of the green spaces should be incorporated in planning. It is pertinent that not only the extent of the green spaces, both in the city limits of Tri City but also in the Periphery area but also the quality be monitored and upgraded from time to time. Close monitoring. Some strategies for maintaining the green character of the region could be through adoption of smart laws that enforce ‘Green on Buildings’ by creating green walls and roofs. The impact of this can be monitored through sensors and geospatial technology models can be generated to monitor the heat island effect. This will help the authorities in taking corrective measures to reduce the heat island effect.\nIt must be noted that the city and its environs are to be considered as ecological space. The authors emphasize that Smart Green Spaces for Chandigarh and its Periphery has to be based on technology within the framework of sustainability. It is pertinent that through smart green spaces the city builds on its social capital. Planning and implementing for the smart green spaces will reduce the adverse impact of urbanization and at the same time maximize the intangible benefits and build on the aspects of culture in turn boosting the economy of the area.\n11\nConclusions\nChandigarh has been one of the most discussed city in India. It was designed to represent the modern India post-independence. However, it is important that modern urban planning should not only focus on the improvement of how a city works, but also how the open spaces or green spaces are areas within a city and the region. Realizing the number of different benefits associated with increased green spaces in urban settings will help us build healthier, vibrant and sustainable settlements.\nThe challenges that are arising in the planned city of India can be addressed through smart tools which essentially include geospatial technologies encompassing remote sensing and GIS for the purpose of online monitoring of the green spaces. It is pertinent that not only the extent of the green spaces, both in the city limits of Tri City but also in the Periphery area but also the quality be monitored and upgraded from time to time. The authors emphasize that Smart Green Spaces for Chandigarh and its Periphery has to be based on technology within the framework of sustainability. Close monitoring of these aspects will help the authorities in improving the green index and per capita ratio.\nIt must be noted that the city and its regions are to be considered as ecological space. It is pertinent that through smart green spaces the city builds on its social capital. Planning and implementing for the smart green spaces will reduce the adverse impact of urbanization and at the same time maximize the intangible benefits and build of the aspects of culture in turn boosting the economy of the area.\nNotes\n1.\nGoddess of power as per the Hindu mythology [\n1\n].\n2.\nFort [\n2\n].\n3.\nModernism in urban planning was based on the principles of clearly distinguishing everything including the four main principals of human activities: living, working, recreation so as to bring order in the city and conceive it as a machine that works according to specific rules [\n6\n].\n4.\nSuperblock is an area of urban land bounded by arterial roads that is the size of multiple typically-sized city blocks [\n7\n].\n5.\nNallah is a runnel or a brook [\n10\n].\n6.\nMethod of urban planning proposed in 1898 by Sir Ebenezer Howard in the United Kingdom were in the urban areas were planned to be self-contained communities surrounded by greenbelts, containing proportionate areas of residences, industry and agriculture [\n12\n].\n7.\nAgriculture here includes horticulture, dairy farming, poultry farming and the planting and upkeep of orchards [\n17\n].\n8.\nCommon name: white fig, locally known as p\nilkhan.\n9.\nCommon name: cylone oak, locally known as\nkusum.\n10.\nCommon name: golden shower tree, locally known as\namaltas.\n11.\nCommon name: apple blossom tree, locally known as jangli dalchini.\n12.\nCommon name: blue jacaranda, locally known as neeli gulmohar.\n13.\nSeasonal streams [\n38\n].\nReferences\nShabdkosh (2018) Meaning of Chandi.\nhttps://shabdkosh.raftaar.in\n.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Smart Urban Green Spaces for Smart Chandigarh\" explores the integration of urban green spaces within the context of Chandigarh's unique planning and development framework. It is particularly relevant to the claim that \"Urban green spaces enhance community well-being\" due to its comprehensive evaluation of both the ecological and socio-psychological benefits that such spaces provide. The authors, Prabh Bedi, Mahavir, and Neha Goel Tripathi, emphasize that urban greenery is not merely aesthetic but a critical component for enhancing the quality of life in urban areas, especially in rapidly urbanizing contexts such as India.\n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The paper directly supports the claim by discussing the multifaceted benefits of urban green spaces, including their role in improving mental health, social interactions, and overall community welfare. The authors make a strong argument that as cities expand and population density increases, the incorporation of green spaces becomes essential. By highlighting Chandigarh's unique master plan, which integrates greenery into urban design, the paper illustrates a proactive approach to urban development that prioritizes community well-being through access to natural spaces. Evidence from various studies indicates a clear correlation between the presence of green spaces and increased physical activity, reduced stress levels, and stronger community ties.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed in this study is primarily qualitative, merging theoretical frameworks with empirical examples from Chandigarh and other Indian cities. While the authors reference various studies that quantify the benefits of green spaces, the direct application of quantitative methods within this paper is limited. Nevertheless, the evidence provided through comparative analysis and case studies enhances its reliability. The mention of sustainable development principles and the implications of urban policy decisions showcases the theoretical robustness of the arguments presented.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The significance of the findings lies in their potential implications for urban planning and public policy. By demonstrating that well-planned urban green spaces can significantly improve community well-being, the authors advocate for a shift in urban development paradigms. The concept of 'Smart Cities' is highlighted, suggesting that integrating technology with green infrastructure can enhance both ecological sustainability and social engagement. This was particularly fruitful in Chandigarh, where urban planning has factored in greenery from the outset, indicating that other cities might achieve similar benefits through deliberate planning processes.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Despite its strengths, the paper does possess limitations; one being the lack of extensive quantitative data that would bolster the argument regarding the direct impact of green spaces on community well-being. Furthermore, it predominantly focuses on Chandigarh and does not explore the variability in benefits across different socio-economic contexts or cultural settings in India. This could lead to an overgeneralization of the findings. The authors also seem to imply that the integration of technology in urban green planning is uniformly beneficial, which may not account for varying degrees of technological access across different urban areas.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a compelling case for the positive impact of urban green spaces on community well-being, supported by qualitative evidence and contextual analysis. However, future research should strive to include more diverse methodologies and settings to fully encapsulate the complexity of the relationship between urban green spaces and community health."
