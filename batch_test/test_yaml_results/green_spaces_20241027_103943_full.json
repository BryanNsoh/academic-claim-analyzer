Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig. Yes N(%) No N(%) Don’t know N(%) Practicing daily social interaction in the pocket parks and nearby open spaces Yes (N) 41 (13.4%) 3 (0.9%) 1 (0.3%) 45 (14.7%) 0.000** No (N) 17 (5.5%) 226 (73.8%) 7 (2.2%) 250 (81.7%)  Don’t know (N) 1 (0.3%) 5 (1.6%) 3 (0.9%) 9 (2.9%)   Total 59 (19.3%) 234 (76.4%) 11 (3.6%) 304 (99.3%)  *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01 using ANOVA Test  One-way ANOVA test used to test the association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor (dependent variable) and the availability of efficient small (pocket) parks in the neighborhoods where respondents lived (independent variable). One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.

ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

The scarcity of parks and natural environments in densely populated cities contributes to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and diminished well-being. Our project proposes developing rooftop parks and gardens to address these issues, transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. The project begins by identifying suitable rooftops for park and garden development. This involves assessing structural integrity, accessibility, and potential community needs. Once appropriate sites are identified, the project moves into the design and construction phase, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The resulting rooftop parks will provide relaxation, recreation, and social interaction spaces.  Community engagement is a critical component of this project. By involving residents from the outset, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and ensure that the rooftop parks meet the community's specific needs. Activities include: • Training local volunteers to maintain the green spaces. • Organizing events to promote awareness. • Creating community-led groups to manage the parks' ongoing maintenance. The benefits of rooftop parks are significant. These green spaces offer urban residents a much-needed escape from city life, providing areas for exercise, relaxation, and social gatherings. The project also seeks to raise awareness about environmental sustainability by integrating educational programs and community activities that promote eco-friendly practices.  The community-driven approach fosters social cohesion and resilience, encouraging collaboration among residents. By involving the community in every project stage, from planning to maintenance, we aim to create a long-lasting impact on urban health and well-being.  Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the quality of life for urban residents, strengthen community ties, and contribute to creating more resilient and sustainable cities. By providing accessible green spaces in urban settings, this project represents a crucial step in addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and its impact on public health and community well-being.    2  SECTION 3: DETAILED PROJECT INFORMATION  1. Problem Statement:  Urban environments often suffer from a significant lack of accessible green spaces, leading to numerous health risks and exacerbating broader humanitarian issues. This scarcity contributes to physical health concerns such as heat-related illnesses, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, it triggers a rise in mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and social isolation (Geary et al., 2023). The limited availability of green spaces restricts opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, which are essential for the well-being of urban residents. The broader impact of this problem extends beyond individual health, affecting community resilience and environmental sustainability. Green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating environmental risks, such as air pollution and the urban heat island effect. They also offer a natural refuge from the stresses of urban life, providing a setting where residents can engage in outdoor activities or simply unwind from the pressures of city living. Despite their importance, millions of people in densely populated cities worldwide face limited access to parks and other green areas, impacting their quality of life and contributing to social inequalities. Research in reputable journals like The Lancet and Environmental Health Perspectives has established a strong link between green spaces and reduced rates of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and various mental health disorders (Rojas-Rueda et al. , 2016). Green spaces can also positively influence children's cognitive development and improve the overall quality of urban environments. Furthermore, global initiatives like the World Health Organization's Urban Green Spaces and Health program emphasize the role of green spaces in promoting public health and environmental quality (World Health Organization,2016). The lack of accessible green spaces also has significant social implications. The unequal distribution of parks and recreational areas often leaves marginalized communities without access to these vital resources, reinforcing existing social disparities. This unequal access undermines environmental sustainability, as green spaces are critical for regulating temperatures, reducing pollution, and promoting biodiversity. The absence of green spaces diminishes environmental quality and increases cities' vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Moreover, the lack of green spaces contributes to increased social isolation, particularly among older adults and children. This issue disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where access to green spaces is often more limited. The result is a cycle of health, social, and environmental inequity that perpetuates itself over time. Addressing the shortage of green spaces in urban areas is crucial for promoting social justice, human rights, and sustainable development. It aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to health, sustainable cities, and climate action. A community-based approach to developing and preserving green spaces can contribute to social cohesion and strengthen urban resilience. It can also create new economic opportunities through community-led initiatives and support efforts to tackle climate change. By prioritizing equitable access to green spaces, cities can foster a sense of community and improve public health outcomes. Addressing this shortage allows for greater inclusivity, ensuring that all residents can 3  benefit from nature's physical, mental, and social advantages within urban settings. Ultimately, green spaces should be viewed not just as amenities but as essential components of a healthy and sustainable urban infrastructure. Addressing this issue holistically not only improves individual health outcomes but also builds stronger, more inclusive communities capable of withstanding socio-economic and environmental stressors.    2. Description of the Solution:  Rooftop parks and gardens offer an innovative solution to the growing problem of limited green spaces in urban areas. As cities become increasingly crowded, these green areas effectively use underutilized rooftop spaces, providing accessible nature and recreational areas within dense urban landscapes. This approach addresses several critical issues simultaneously, fostering environmental sustainability, enhancing social cohesion, and stimulating economic growth. The concept of rooftop parks and gardens is rooted in the efficient use of existing infrastructure, a critical consideration in cities where available land is scarce and development pressures are high. By repurposing rooftops, we can create green spaces that serve multiple functions, from improving air quality to providing community gathering spaces. This innovative approach reduces the need to acquire additional land for green spaces, allowing cities to maintain their density while offering residents much-needed areas for recreation and relaxation.  Environmental Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens contribute significantly to environmental sustainability. These green spaces act as \"green lungs\" within the concrete jungle, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They also help mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing natural cooling, which is crucial as global temperatures rise and cities become warmer. Rooftop greenery can reduce energy consumption by providing natural insulation, leading to lower heating and cooling costs for buildings. This, in turn, can reduce the overall carbon footprint of urban areas.  Additionally, rooftop parks and gardens contribute to improved water management in cities. They can act as natural rainwater catchment systems, reducing runoff and easing pressure on urban drainage systems. This helps to prevent flooding and promotes groundwater recharge, contributing to a more sustainable urban water cycle. Rooftop gardens can also support biodiversity by providing birds, insects, and other wildlife habitats in an otherwise sterile urban environment. This biodiversity aspect is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems within cities.  Social Benefits Beyond environmental sustainability, rooftop parks and gardens offer significant social benefits. Studies have shown that access to green spaces can improve mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. These spaces provide a respite from the noise and congestion of urban life, allowing residents to relax and connect with nature. Rooftop parks and gardens also serve as communal gathering spots, fostering social interaction and strengthening community bonds. These green spaces are precious in cities where social isolation is a growing concern. By creating environments that encourage people to come together, rooftop parks and gardens can help combat loneliness and promote a sense of belonging. They can also promote physical activity, as they offer spaces for exercise and recreation. This is particularly important in urban areas where traditional parks and open spaces are inaccessible. 4   Furthermore, rooftop parks and gardens can help bridge social divides by providing inclusive spaces where people from diverse backgrounds can meet and interact. This can foster greater understanding and tolerance among different groups, creating a more cohesive and harmonious urban community.  Economic Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens also offer significant economic benefits. They can enhance property values, making them an attractive feature for real estate development. A study by the National Association of Realtors found that proximity to parks and green spaces can increase property values by up to 20%. This increase in property values can increase cities' tax revenue, providing additional funding for public services and infrastructure.  Moreover, rooftop parks and gardens can create employment opportunities in construction and ongoing maintenance. This can stimulate local economies and provide landscaping, gardening, and park management jobs. These employment opportunities can be particularly beneficial in urban areas with high unemployment rates, offering a pathway for economic development and revitalization. Rooftop parks and gardens can also support local businesses by attracting visitors and encouraging foot traffic in urban areas. These green spaces can become popular destinations, drawing people from across the city and creating opportunities for retail and service businesses nearby. This can lead to a more vibrant urban economy and a higher quality of life for residents.  Theory of Change The theory of change underlying the adoption of rooftop parks and gardens revolves around their capacity to catalyze positive transformations across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By converting rooftops into green spaces, we can anticipate tangible improvements in air quality, urban heat island mitigation, and biodiversity conservation, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals.  Socially, these spaces can foster community cohesion, promote physical and mental well-being, and provide inclusive areas for recreational activities and social interaction. The sense of community that rooftop parks and gardens foster can strengthen urban resilience and support efforts to build more inclusive and equitable cities.  Rooftop parks and gardens offer a holistic solution to the problem of limited green spaces in urban areas by addressing environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and economic development. This innovative approach can lead to more resilient, inclusive, and livable cities that prioritize the well-being of their residents while promoting sustainable development goals.            5  3. Program Design and Implementation Plan:  The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program is a comprehensive initiative to enhance public health and well-being in urban areas by transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. This program addresses the growing issue of limited green spaces in cities, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. The overarching goal is to improve physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents by constructing rooftop parks, engaging communities through awareness programs, and providing educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The first step in implementing this program involves conducting a thorough needs assessment to identify rooftops suitable for development. This step includes extensive surveys and consultations with property owners, local authorities, and community stakeholders to ensure that the rooftops meet structural and safety requirements. The needs assessment also gauges community support and confirms regulatory compliance. By selecting appropriate rooftops, the program provides its efforts to align with local building codes and address potential risks. Once the suitable rooftops are identified, the program moves into the design and planning phase, which involves creating detailed architectural and landscaping blueprints. This phase emphasizes safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. Collaborating with urban planners and landscape architects, the designs incorporate elements that support the program's goals while enhancing the visual appeal of the urban landscape. Following the design phase, the construction of the rooftop parks and gardens begins. This step involves preparing the rooftops, installing safety features, and constructing green spaces according to the approved plans. The program establishes clear timelines and milestones for construction, allowing for efficient project management. To ensure the longevity of the rooftop parks, a comprehensive maintenance plan is developed, involving community volunteers and local organizations to maintain the green spaces. Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the program's success. The program organizes various events and awareness campaigns to encourage community participation and foster a sense of ownership. Volunteer opportunities are created for the upkeep of the rooftop parks, and educational workshops on gardening and environmental practices are offered to promote sustainable behavior. This community-focused approach helps integrate the rooftop parks into the urban culture, turning them into valued assets. To mitigate potential problems, the program implements several vital strategies. Diverse funding sources are secured to ensure financial stability, while close collaboration with local authorities helps navigate regulatory challenges. The program also uses weather-resistant materials and adjusts construction timelines to accommodate adverse weather conditions. Extensive community outreach and education efforts are made to reduce resistance and build strong support for the program. Robust evaluation metrics are established to monitor the program's progress and success. These include indicators such as reported stress levels, surface temperatures, and the number of completed rooftop projects. These metrics provide a clear framework for assessing the program's impact and allow for timely adjustments to address any challenges during implementation. The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program aims to significantly improve public health and well-being in urban areas through a well-thought-out program design and a comprehensive implementation plan. By engaging the community 6  and addressing potential risks, the program creates sustainable and accessible green spaces that contribute to the overall resilience and quality of life in urban environments.

Evaluation Metrics and Methodology:  The methodology for evaluating the impact of the Rooftop Parks and Gardens program on urban health and well-being combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. A primary metric involves achieving a measurable reduction in self-reported stress levels among residents living near rooftop parks/gardens, assessed through pre- and post-intervention surveys. The evaluation methodology encompasses various indicators corresponding to the outcomes and outputs defined in the log frame. Below are the key indicators, measurement approaches, and SMART criteria that guide the evaluation process: Outcome Indicators 1. Improved physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents: • Indicator: Reduced reported stress levels among residents near established rooftop parks/gardens. • Measurement: Conduct pre- and post-intervention surveys to assess changes in self-reported stress levels. This data will help determine the program's effectiveness in enhancing residents' well-being. • SMART Criteria: Achieve a 20% reduction in self-reported stress levels among residents living near rooftop parks/gardens, demonstrating a tangible impact on urban health and well-being. 2. Lower urban heat island temperatures: • Indicator: Decrease in average surface temperatures in areas with rooftop parks/gardens by 2 degrees Celsius compared to surrounding urban areas. • Measurement: Use remote sensing technology, such as thermal imaging, to track surface temperatures before and after the program's implementation. The comparison of temperatures in areas with and without rooftop parks will help assess the program's cooling effects. • SMART Criteria: Achieve a 2 degrees Celsius reduction in average surface temperatures in areas with rooftop parks/gardens, indicating successful mitigation of the urban heat island effect. Output Indicators 1. Construction and establishment of rooftop parks/gardens: • Indicator: Number of rooftop park/garden projects completed. • Measurement: Maintain a detailed record of completed projects, including their locations, sizes, and opening dates. This data will clearly measure the program's progress toward its objectives. • SMART Criteria: Complete a predetermined number of rooftop park/garden projects within the designated timeframe, ensuring proper documentation and consistency with program plans. 2. Community engagement and awareness programs: • Indicator: Attendance at community events and level of community participation. • Measurement: Keep attendance records at community engagement events, such as workshops, information sessions, and volunteer activities. These figures will reflect the program's success in fostering community involvement. • SMART Criteria: Increase attendance at community engagement events through targeted promotion and maintain high participation rates, indicating robust community support and engagement.  8  Additional Considerations The program's evaluation strategy incorporates pre- and post-intervention surveys to measure changes in stress levels, remote sensing technology to track temperature variations, and attendance records for community engagement activities. These metrics ensure a comprehensive assessment of the program's impact and facilitate adjustments as needed to meet the program's goals. The success of the Rooftop Parks and Gardens program depends on solid stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance, and ongoing community support. To mitigate risks, the program has established mechanisms to ensure consistent funding, community outreach, and collaboration with local authorities. These steps will help address potential challenges and contribute to the program's overall success.   Citations:           B, K. (2023, December).

Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people.Maintaining functional and biodiverse urban green spaces is fundamental for liveable cities (cf. SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20.

Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2. Final most parsimonious SEM connecting garden management (land-use types, management intensity), urbanisation, plant and soil fauna diversity with soil multifunctionality (AICc = 288.3, Fisher’s C = 24.3, P = 0.93). Arrows represent unidirectional relationships among variables. Black arrows denote significantly (p < 0.05) positive and red arrows significantly negative relationships (Table 3). Dashed grey arrows represent non significant relationships (p > 0.05). The thickness of paths has been scaled based on the magnitude of the standardised regression coefficient. Conditional R2s, based on the variance of both the fixed and random effects, as well as marginal R2s, based on the fixed effect parts for each component models are given in the boxes of the response variables. Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

R2M is based on fixed effects and R2C on fixed and random (garden ID) effects. Total estimates of indirect pathways are given in Table S6.7Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/similar relationship of management intensity and decreased diversity has been observed in urban lawns. Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

        "abstract": "Urban green spaces are integral elements of urban landscapes, conferring a multitude of advantages that enrich urban living. Nevertheless, the rapid urbanization of cities often ignores green spaces. To ensure that physical planning creates effective and accessible green spaces, this study explores the use, perception, and socio-economic dynamics of urban green spaces in Nairobi. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including surveys, interviews, and GIS analysis, the study reveals insights into how urban green spaces contribute to environmental sustainability, physical and mental well-being, and social cohesion. Additionally, the findings of the economic assessment of the use of urban green spaces underscores the cost efficiencies and willingness of users to invest in their enhancements, thereby emphasizing the economic significance of green spaces. These results underline the importance of equitable access, effective management, and inclusive design in maximizing the benefits of urban green spaces for urban residents. This research further contributes to a broader understanding of urban green space planning and management, providing insights applicable to diverse urban contexts globally.",

These issues negatively impact the sustainability of cities and human well-being. Urban life also causes physical diseases and chronic stress, leading to diseases and cancer (Kim and Jin\n2018\n). Urbanized citizens expect a high quality of life, including good public health, an unpolluted environment, good food, safe drinking water, and recreational opportunities in green spaces (Botkin and Beveridge\n1997\n). A liveable city must have green spaces to provide healthier surroundings and various benefits to urban dwellers. Studies show that living close to urban green spaces (UGS) leads to increased happiness and health, as they provide an ideal setting for unwinding from daily stress (Addas,\n2023\n). Urban planning and design face the challenge of meeting residents’ expectations, and UGS such as parks, gardens, plazas, and trees are essential in addressing this (Reyes-Riveros et al.\n2021\n). These areas offer comfortable living environments (Takano et al.\n2002\n), physical and emotional benefits (Grahn and Stigsdotter\n2010\n), and a positive association with perceived general health (Maas et al.\n2006\n). Research conducted in metropolitan cities like New York (Sutton and Anderson\n2016\n), Singapore (Henderson\n2013\n), Tokyo (Kohsaka and Okumura\n2014\n) and Delhi (Paul and Nagendra\n2017\n) highlights the importance of green spaces in regulating urban health, supporting biodiversity, and enhancing livelihood opportunities.\nPublic health indicators primarily focus on physical health, including stress, obesity, respiratory diseases, mortality, and life expectancy. UGS is crucial for physical activity and urban health protection (Wolch et al.\n2014\n). Green spaces have positive effects on mortality, CVD morbidity, cardiometabolic factors, mental health, low birth weight, physical activity, sleep quality, and urban crime (Yang et al.\n2021\n). Since the 1990s, there has been a rapid increase in public health and green space studies, with interdisciplinary categories emerging (Zhang et al.\n2020\n). However, studies on social health are sparse, despite the growing prominence of environmental disciplines.\nUrban planners, park administrators, and public health professionals can use green spaces to promote health equity (Rigolon et al.\n2021\n), but access to these spaces is often stratified based on income, ethnic-racial characteristics, age, gender, and disability. Research has shown links between green space accessibility indicators and positive health effects, such as a significant relation between the percentage of green space within a one-kilometer and three-kilometer radius and a protective effect against anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts (Maas et al.\n2006\n). Understanding these factors is crucial for achieving equality in urban spaces (Nutsford et al.\n2013\n).\nPolicymakers and researchers are working to address access issues in UGS to ensure environmental justice, public health, and physical activity. Three parameters of UGS development policies have been identified: proximity, park acres, and quality (Rigolon\n2016\n). Proximity refers to a geographic unit’s distance to the nearest parks (Talen\n2010\n), while park acres refer to the number or size of green space and recreational facilities that increase the total size of the UGS (Sister et al.\n2010\n). Quality encompasses the qualities, features, and fitness for purpose that impact how the populace uses and interacts with the UGS (Knobel et al.\n2021\n), aiming to improve the quality of UGS through improved service and maintenance levels (Rutt and Gulsrud\n2016\n).\nUGS management and planning in high-density urban areas require accurate information about these areas. Visitor perceptions are a common method used to measure UGS quality, which is crucial for effective management (Baur et al.\n2016\n). However, visitor perception of surrounding UGS is subjective and varies from person to person (Langemeyer et al.\n2015\n), influenced by factors like personality, location, socio-economic profile, scene composition, and complexity (Chen et al.\n2009\n). As a result, understanding the advantages and objective qualities of UGS is difficult, making it difficult to interpret perceptual data on UGS (Kothencz and Blaschke\n2017\n).\nAlthough a lot of studies have focused on many issues related to visitor perceptions (Basu and Nagendra\n2021\n; Chen et al.\n2009\n; Font et al.\n2021\n; Kothencz and Blaschke,\n2017\n; Paul and Nagendra,\n2017\n; Rupprecht et al.\n2015\n) of UGS, studies on visitor complaints are limited (Delshammar et al.\n2015\n). The handling of customer and visitor complaints can significantly impact satisfaction and loyalty levels, indicating the importance of evaluating organizational performance (Calin\n2012\n). Organizations can address complaints effectively by finding effective solutions and taking corrective action if necessary. Management should also prepare for positive feedback to boost visitor numbers (Fang et al.\n2016\n). Satisfaction can transform dissatisfied customers into satisfied and loyal ones, leading to revisiting, highlighting superior features, positive word-of-mouth, recommendations, and longer stays, particularly in UGS (Çevik\n2020\n). A satisfied park visitor is thought to increase the frequency of UGS visits and the time spent in these areas. In this context, the increase in the use of UGS in communities can make positive contributions to both individual and public health.\nDespite being the most densely populated metropolis in Türkiye, Istanbul has far less green space per person (7.6 m2) (İBBF\n2019\n) than the minimum level (9 m2) that the World Health Organization (\n2012\n) recommends for healthy cities. Under these circumstances, it is even more crucial to conduct research for a more effective and efficient use of the city’s green spaces. As a result, it will be possible to help design public policies that will increase the health and well-being of UGS visitors by revealing the complaints of UGS visitors about these areas. Therefore, aiming to explore the visitors’ complaints about the UGS in Istanbul, the research question of this study is “Which aspects of the nation gardens in Istanbul do visitors complain about?”\nMethodology\nResearch context and data collection\nAccording to the Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change (\n2022\n), Istanbul has 12 completed nation gardens projects, which aim to increase green space and meet recreational demands. Using Google Maps reviews as the primary source of data, the study focused on analyzing visitor complaints regarding these 12 nation gardens. Compared to surveys and interviews, online reviews offer a novel and efficient method for investigating visitors’ perspectives (Ye et al.\n2014\n). Further, research shows that 63.6% of internet users are likely to check Google Reviews before deciding to visit a particular destination, which makes Google the leading review site (Review Tracker\n2022\n). This implies that Google Maps user reviews can be a valuable data source to explore visitors’ perceptions of the nation gardens.\nGoogle Maps allows users to control who sees their public contributions, including reviews, photos, and ratings, which are automatically found on their profile and can be restricted by updating profile settings (Google Maps\n2024a\n). It also enables users to view and edit their public profile, which includes the ability to change their Google name, profile photo, add a short bio, manage account settings and privacy controls, find past contributions and posts, and review topic stats (Google Maps\n2024b\n). In adherence to Google Maps’ privacy policy and terms of service, the publicly available data was utilized for this study. Nevertheless, user names and locations were not revealed, prioritizing ethical considerations, including user privacy and anonymity.\nData screening and selection criteria\nA comprehensive dataset comprising 38,965 Google Maps user reviews was initially screened to identify visitor complaints about the 12 nation gardens in Istanbul. Then, to ensure the relevance and precision of the reviews, the following exclusion criteria were implemented:\n(1) Reviews containing questions only (e.g.,\n“What time does it close?”\n);\n(2) Positive reviews (e.g.,\n“One of the most beautiful scenery in Istanbul!”\n);\n(3) Neutral reviews (e.g.,\n“Barbecues and samovars are prohibited.”\n);\n(4) Non-specific visitor complaints; (e.g.,\n“I gave one star because I wanted to.”\n);\n(5) Rating-only reviews.\nReviews with five-star ratings were not excluded a priori, as some discrepancies between certain reviews and corresponding ratings were noticed. For instance, a visitor, despite giving a five-star rating, stated\n“Nice service but no maintenance! Most playground equipment is broken and not repaired. There is a security but it’s not active.”\nSimilarly, another visitor giving a five-star rating stated\n“I gave it five stars to stand out, but this place is worthless.”\nGiven such discrepancies, all visitor reviews with complaints ranging from a one-star rating to a five-star rating were included in the analysis.\nThematic analysis process\nAccording to the predetermined “criteria for inclusion/exclusion of online comments,” three researchers identified the comments to be included in the analysis, and all identified comments were coded separately by the three researchers involved in the study in two stages (Saldaña\n2015\n). In the primary coding, the data set was allowed to generate codes, while in the secondary coding, the codes obtained from the first coding were structured. This was followed by steps aimed at identifying patterns, connections, and common themes among the final codes. To do this, literature on UGS/park recreation was also reviewed. The full consensus among all researchers ensured that the themes emerging from each researcher’s coding took their final form (Miles et al.\n2019\n).\nFollowing the data screening, the final dataset comprised 4143 reviews specifically addressing complaints, forming the basis for the subsequent thematic analysis of visitor complaints. Each review was transferred to Excel, and 4143 were gathered in an Excel spreadsheet, which was then imported into MAXQDA software. Data analysis was performed using Braun and Clarke’s (\n2006\n) six-phased thematic analysis approach (Braun and Clarke\n2006\n). First, users’ reviews were actively read to become familiar with the data, thereby identifying possible meanings and patterns in the codes. Second, by organizing the data into meaningful groups, initial codes were generated. Third, by gathering different codes with shared meanings, whether they could be grouped under a common theme was identified. Thus, a set of candidate themes was constructed. Fourth, considering both coded data extracts and the entire data set, the candidate themes were reviewed and refined. Fifth, each theme was defined and named. In this phase, each theme was handled in relation to the other themes to ensure that there was not too much overlap between the themes. Also, to give the reader an immediate idea of what the theme was about, it was taken into account that the name of the theme was short and concise. Last, selected vivid and compelling extracts that captured the essence of the stories about the data were reported. Further, to support the qualitative findings about the prevalence of the themes in the data, the percentages and frequencies of the codes under each theme were calculated.\nResults\nIn total, 6135 coded data were extracted from the 4143 visitor complaints. 91 codes were then generated and gathered under five themes: outdoor areas/physical characteristics (28.4%), facilities (27.5%), visitors’ interactions (23.3%), accessibility/entrance management (11.9%), and restrictions and security implications (8.9%) (see Figs.\n1\nand\n2\n). The generated codes and themes were organized under the code system in MAXQDA and then visualized as shown in Fig.\n3\n.\nFig. 1\nDistributions of visitor complaints.\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nCode clouds.\nFull size image\nFig. 3\nVisitor Complaints.\nFull size image\nOutdoor areas/physical characteristics\nOutdoor areas/physical characteristics were the most frequently referenced theme by visitors. 17 codes were generated for this theme. Visitors’ primary complaints in this theme related to a lack of shade trees, a lack of outdoor benches, and poorly maintained outdoor areas. Visitors expressed their complaints as follows:\n“I don’t recommend going before sunset. It’s very difficult to find tree shade.”\n“Seating areas, such as benches, are insufficient. Many families including us had to sit on the ground.”\n“The area was so dirty and neglected that I was very surprised, it was the first time I saw a nation garden so bad… It was full of garbage in the forest areas.”\nOther common complaints included sloping ground that impeded movement and activities, as well as proximity to contaminated water sources which raised health concerns. Visitors also complained about the lack of shaded seating areas to protect them from sunlight and the lack of green spaces that spoil the natural atmosphere. Insufficient cleaning services in outdoor areas contributed to a less pleasant visiting experience. Visitors further mentioned that surrounding buildings, narrow outdoor areas, and the proximity to busy highways reduce the attractiveness of the nation gardens. Visitors additionally reported dissatisfaction with the lack of recreational event opportunities. Concerns such as inadequate direction signs, poor ground conditions, inadequate accessibility for people with mobility difficulties, and irregular lawn watering schedules were stated by the visitors. Windy weather conditions, inadequate landscape design, and the lack of hand-washing sinks all contributed to visitor unpleasantness. In addition, inconveniently located seats and a lack of litter bins affected the usability of the gardens.\nFacilities\nThe second theme was facilities. 33 codes were generated for this theme. Then, the theme was divided into three sub-themes: general facilities (16 codes), children’s playgrounds (8 codes), and physical activity and sports (9 codes). The primary complaints in general facilities were a lack of food and beverage facilities, poor toilet hygiene, and a lack of toilets. For this sub-theme, examples of the statements most frequently complained about by visitors are given below:\n“It doesn’t even have a place to get water. At least there could have been a vending machine or something.”\n“It is a very beautiful place but the toilets are in a terrible condition, they need to be taken care of. Although it is paid, it is not hygienic.”\n“There is a WC problem, it’s not enough. Additional public toilets required.”\nIn addition, many of the visitors found the prices for products and services excessive. Besides, some visitors expressed their concerns about the absence and poor hygiene of prayer rooms around, since they could not fulfill their religious duties. Visitors also mentioned being disappointed by the absence of designated barbecue areas and the unavailability of some facilities. Limited food options and poor service quality in food and beverage facilities were the other issues that contributed to dissatisfaction. The working hours and locations of the facilities were also questioned by the visitors. Charging entry fees for essential services such as toilets was considered inappropriate. Inadequate and impolite personnel at the facilities further worsened the overall experience. The absence of baby care rooms was also noted as a drawback by families visiting the gardens.\nInsufficient playgrounds, a lack of equipment variety, and poorly maintained equipment were the most observed complaints in the playgrounds sub-theme. Poorly located playgrounds, unsafe equipment, dysfunctional flooring, and uncleanliness made nation gardens less appealing to families with children. Besides, although uncommon, several adults monopolized children’s equipment by using the playgrounds, which caused safety concerns and discomfort both for children and parents. Some examples of the most frequently addressed complaints by visitors are given below:\n“There is a tiny playground in the big area, there could be more. Children are waiting in line to play.”\n“The playground for children is insufficient. It has a huge area but there are two swings. More different equipment could have been put, instead of ordinary swings and slides…”\n“The swings are about to break and must be repaired before an accident occurs.”\nThe most commonly reported complaints in the physical activities and sports sub-theme were a lack of a sufficient number of sports fields, poor condition of running/cycling paths, and a lack of rental bikes. Lack of running/cycling paths, poorly maintained sports fields, lack of sports equipment, user-unfriendly bike rental systems, poorly maintained rental bikes, and unsafe sports fields were also expressed by visitors as contributors to dissatisfaction by limiting their opportunities for physical activity and sports. Some examples of the most frequently reported complaints by visitors for this sub-theme are as follows:\n“…there is a volleyball net in the middle of the basketball court and when there are people who want to play both basketball and volleyball, the atmosphere gets a little too complicated.”\n“The running and walking path should be a tartan track. This is the first time I have seen a gravel running track. It definitely needs to be fixed.”\n“…but I have a small request, the number of bicycles is very small considering the area. It would be better if there were a little more.”\nVisitors’ interactions\nThe third theme was visitors’ interactions. Six codes were generated for this theme. Complaints from the visitors were mostly about overcrowding, too many foreign visitors, and visitors’ littering. Some examples of the visitor reviews are given below:\n“The only downside is that it is extremely crowded, you have to wait in line for everything. It is possible to wait for half an hour in the cafeteria or WC queue. My advice, especially on weekends and public holidays, do not come.”\n“I was so upset that I was wandering around :(as if I was in another country). There were very few Turks. It was like a city of Arabia or Syria. I don’t judge anyone, but in this case, it’s not normal at all, we became foreigners in our own country.”\n“There are litter bins everywhere, but unfortunately, it is too beautiful park for local and foreign visitors who throw the sunflower seed shells they eat on the grass and leave food on the rocks…”\nAdditionally, many visitors expressed their discomfort with the overwhelming smell of barbecue and samovar smoke. Moreover, the visibility of people who appeared threatening or frightening elevated visitors’ concerns and impaired their sense of personal safety. As well, visitors became irritated when they encountered others ignoring park rules, such as jumping across pedestrian or bicycle paths or behaving inappropriately in designated seating areas. Vandalism, disruptive noise from other visitors, intimacy between couples, and socio-cultural heterogeneity in shared spaces contributed to interpersonal conflicts. Besides, the prevalence of cigarette and hookah smoke, along with the presence of drinkers, exacerbated discomfort and health concerns among non-smoking visitors. Lastly, the presence of fast cyclists on the pedestrian paths drew complaints from visitors.\nAccessibility/Entrance management\nThe fourth theme was entrance management. Six codes were generated for this theme. Under this theme, the visitors mainly mentioned the busy parking area, parking fees, lack of entrance gates, and visiting hours. Visitors voiced their concerns about accessibility and entrance management in the following statements:\n“It is very nice and clean but the parking lot is very small, especially on weekends. Last weekend we made preparations for a picnic, we couldn’t find a place for the car, and we turned back.”\n“The parking lot has become paid. The nation garden should be used for the benefit of the public. I think twice about going because of the parking fee.”\n“It’s ridiculous that it closes at 10\npm, what’s 10\npm on a summer day? Just when it’s getting cooler, you hear the announcement that the park will close.”\nBesides, visitors expressed their frustration with the limited public transportation options to reach the nation gardens. Since the gardens were mostly located far from the city center, they were also difficult to reach on foot. Thus, visitors had few alternatives to reach the gardens other than by automobile or motorcycle. Visitors traveling by automobile or motorcycle were also dissatisfied with the long travel time caused by frequent traffic jams along the route. One of the complaints voiced by visitors was that the nation gardens were closed to visitors on Mondays. They stated that they would prefer the gardens to be accessible to visitors every day of the week.\nRestrictions and security implications\nThe last theme was restrictions and security implications. The main points of the 14 codes generated under this theme were no lightning at night, not being allowed to barbecue/use a samovar, and inadequate security measures. Some examples of the main visitor complaints are as follows:\n“When it gets dark, the lights don’t turn on and it gets pitch dark. I think the authorities should find a solution to this.”\n“Barbecue samovar is forbidden, people come here to picnic, this is not a playground.”\n“It has large and useful areas, but security is low. It needs to be more secure. The camera system should be more intense.”\nVisitors further criticized the way of implementing security measures, loud public announcements, a lack of security personnel, and their indifferent and rude behaviors. Visitor complaints involving pedestrianization in nation gardens differed. Some visitors complained that nation gardens were not pedestrian-friendly, while those who visited there by car or motorcycle complained about the motorized vehicle restrictions. Some of the nation gardens do not allow visitors to sit on the grass, which is deemed ridiculous and pointless by several visitors. The presence of stray dogs, pests, and mosquitoes in the area also affected the visitors’ satisfaction adversely.\nDiscussions\nVisitor satisfaction is directly linked to the positive or negative experience, as it relates to meeting needs or motives (Tian-Cole and Cromption\n2003\n). Negative experiences often lead to complaints (Bitner et al.\n1994\n). The study revealed that more than three-quarters of visitor complaints about urban green areas examined were due to outdoor areas/physical characteristics, facilities and visitor interactions. The primary complaint of the visitors of the nation garden is related to outdoor areas/physical characteristics. In past studies, it is seen that factors such as enjoying/being in nature (Andriotis\n2011\n; Sreetheran,\n2017\n), getting fresh air (Gashu et al.\n2020\n; Sreetheran\n2017\n), resting and viewing the scenery (Chiesura\n2004\n) come at the beginning of the motivations of UGS visitors to visit these areas. In addition, citizens living in metropolitan areas prefer high levels of greenery, more seats and large UGS (Lo and Jim\n2012\n). The study highlights a deficiency in Istanbul’s gardens, indicating a lack of natural and physical features that align with the fundamental motivations for visiting green spaces. Consequently, this inadequacy may have heightened the demand for green areas and raised expectations among urban residents. Addressing common complaints such as insufficient tree shade and outdoor seating could significantly enhance the capacity of these spaces to fulfill visitor expectations. Managers could address these concerns by taking into account such feedback and implementing necessary improvements.\nFacilities are a significant complaint subject, with complaints categorized into general facilities, children’s playgrounds, and physical activity and sports opportunities. The primary issue is the lack of food and beverage facilities, as well as inadequate toilet facilities and lack of maintenance. Considering that the success of a park depends on both supply and maintenance (Jibril and Elfartas\n2018\n) and that basic park amenities are necessary for visitors of all age groups (McCormack et al.\n2010\n), park planning and administration must ensure proper facility maintenance and provide amenities that meet visitor needs to improve the quality of life for urban dwellers. Another complaint theme identified in the study is related to playgrounds. Prior studies on UGS usage have revealed that taking kids outside is one of the main motivations for visiting (Irvine et al.\n2013\n). Many families go to playgrounds to be with their children or to keep their children physically active (Refshauge et al.\n2012\n). And these facilities offer chances for socializing, playing, and carrying out physical fitness activities (Qazi\n2011\n). Therefore, the presence and maintenance of playgrounds is crucial, especially for urban dwellers with children. The current study also found that visitors complained about lack of physical activity and sports opportunities. UGS is an important component in promoting physical activity, and these areas are one of the important quality indicators of these areas (Zhang et al.\n2022\n). Many studies show a strong relationship between UGS and physical activity. In addition to having specially designed facilities for sports, exercise and other strenuous activities, it also offers areas where people can run or walk (Cohen et al.\n2007\n), and is one of the most important motivational factors for city residents to use parks (Bedimo-Rung et al.\n2005\n). UGS visitors could be influenced by the design and condition of the facilities (Bedimo-Rung et al.\n2005\n). If visitors are not satisfied, the UGS may go underutilized or be abandoned (Ali and Nawawi\n2006\n). For this reason, the facilities offered by UGS should favor the people’s needs, demands, and preferences.\nThe “visitor interactions” was identified as an important complaint, highlighting the potential problems arising from encounters with crowds. Crowding research highlights its significant social impact on outdoor recreation and reveals that high human density can cause visitor stress in UGS (Arnberger and Eder\n2015\n). UGS visitors are motivated by the experience of silence and peace (Shan\n2014\n), and often avoid crowds to achieve this state of tranquility (Wan and Shen,\n2015\n). The research confirms the common issue of crowding in densely populated cities such as Istanbul, highlighting the need for effective solutions to address this issue. Another theme identified within the scope of visitor interactions was that there were too many foreign visitors in the areas. UGS and city parks are crucial for social integration, providing temporary leisure spaces for various ethnic groups, and fostering a sense of belonging (Stodolska et al.\n2017\n) and attachment (Neal et al.\n2015\n). However, encounters between different ethnic groups in these areas can lead to negative consequences. Dines et al. (\n2006\n) noted conflicts in neighborhood public spaces, particularly neighborhood parks, due to racial tension (Dines et al.\n2006\n). Madanipour (\n2010\n) highlighted problematic incidents involving minorities in Rotterdam, Netherlands, due to the city’s heavy use of public spaces (Madanipour\n2010\n). Istanbul, Türkiye’s largest city, is home to the highest number of immigrants, causing negative attitudes among locals (Doğan et al.\n2020\n). This attitude is believed to be reflected in park areas and affects study results. In this context, park managers should tailor park design and event programing to embrace diverse communities and encourage positive interactions.\nIn the current study, another complaint issue identified is related to accessibility and entrance management. In particular, inequalities in the accessibility and distribution of parks and green spaces are an issue that is gaining increasing attention. Some of the main areas of research have focused on identifying access levels and areas that lack accessibility (Wei\n2017\n). This situation is also shown as one of the important constraints on individuals’ use of parks and green areas (Rushing et al.\n2019\n). In this context, it is recommended that urban park planners seek strategies to increase the accessibility of urban parks to ensure that socio-cultural benefits are shared equitably (Talal and Santelmann\n2021\n). The last complaint theme identified in this current study is restrictions and security implications. Along with its many advantages, UGS has several disadvantages that are frequently disregarded (Maruthaveeran and van den Bosch\n2014\n). Numerous empirical investigations have indicated a direct correlation between decreased utilization of UGS and fear of crime. However, fear of park use due to perceived safety has been reported, especially among children and women (McCormick and Holland\n2015\n). Apart from this, the literature also investigates the physical characteristics such as landscape design, vegetation density, maintenance, physical incivility, amount of light, way-finding and legibility, and visibility of UGSs that may affect perceived safety (Mahrous et al.\n2018\n).\nThis exploratory study contributes to the extensive literature by determining the complaints of visitors of Istanbul nation gardens in these areas. In this study, five complaint themes were identified for these areas, and it was reported that three of these themes named outdoor areas/physical characteristics, facilities and visitor interactions constituted three-quarters of the complaints made. Apart from these themes, other factors such as accessibility and entrance management and the limitations and security implications of nation gardens appear to be factors that generate fewer complaints. Examining the codes that comprise these themes demonstrates that complaints regarding the crowd are prominent. In this context, especially in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul, where the amount of green space is limited, park planners can integrate the suggestions, expectations and needs of visitors in improving existing parks and designing new ones. The investigation of park visitors’ complaints could add a new social- and people-oriented dimension to refine design and management. In this way, by ensuring more effective use of UGS, individual and social benefits, such as health outcomes obtained from these areas, can be maximised.\nImplications\nThe analysis of visitor grievances and the ensuing application of remedies are critical to improving UGS. The study’s conclusions have several useful ramifications that apply to this situation. These suggestions provide concrete actions to resolve visitor issues and improve UGS quality. The development and administration of parks and green spaces may improve visitor satisfaction and the general quality of life in cities by using such doable measures.\nSeveral management implications have been suggested to improve UGS in light of the study’s findings. In order to enhance the physical characteristics and operational efficiency of outdoor areas, it is advised to increase the selection of sitting opportunities, such as picnic tables and benches, and to strategically place these facilities around the park. Expanding the number of trees in sitting and rest spaces can improve comfort on bright days by providing the shade that is needed. A nice and friendly atmosphere may also be maintained by enhancing maintenance and repair services and increasing the frequency of cleaning and waste collection.\nFurther recommendations focus on enhancing the overall visitor experience and accessibility. Ensuring the availability of clean, accessible toilets and establishing more facilities that offer diverse food and beverage options are critical for visitor satisfaction. Designing dedicated areas for children’s play and sports activities can cater to a broader audience and enhance recreational opportunities. Managing the number of visitors, particularly during peak times like weekends and holidays, will help prevent overcrowding. Additionally, for visitor management, practices can be implemented to help different ethnic groups communicate and understand each other by planning activities that will encourage cultural diversity and participation. Security can be improved by enhancing lighting, installing security cameras, and increasing patrols, which will also create a safer environment for activities such as barbecuing and picnicking. Extending the working hours of services provided at UGSs and increasing public transportation options would make these spaces more accessible and user-friendly.\nTo ensure sustainability in UGSs, it is imperative to establish a framework that incorporates residents into the system, in addition to implementing practical applications informed by research findings. In the current study by Nguyen and Jones (\n2022\n), it is suggested that the development of natural areas can be contributed by developing an eco-surplus culture among residents. This concept is a set of environmentally friendly attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviors shared by a group of people, aimed at reducing negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and protecting and restoring nature. Encouraging the cultivation of an eco-surplus culture has the potential to enhance city residents’ awareness and appreciation of biodiversity, conservation endeavors, and initiatives aimed at addressing environmental challenges within UGSs. This approach also facilitates UGSs’ role in educating visitors about environmental issues and potential solutions. Thus, urban residents have the opportunity to engage actively in environmental conservation and sustainability endeavors through such initiatives. Given this information, a comprehensive approach can be developed to protect and enhance green spaces in densely populated areas like Istanbul, where green space is limited. This approach may include nature education workshops, awareness programs, volunteer opportunities for community-based nature conservation efforts, organization of ecologically oriented recreational activities integrated with nature, and the implementation of environmentally sustainable green space designs. The increasing efforts by authorities to encourage the utilization of these areas will also enhance city residents’ contact with nature. Considering that contact with nature is deemed an effective means for constructing eco-surplus culture (Vuong and Nguyen\n2023\n), this situation can generate a cycle by fostering interaction. In this context, UGSs are believed to play a key role in the formation of eco-surplus culture within societies.\nBeyond the traditional establishment of environmental conservation culture, reshaping cultural values as proposed by Vuong (\n2021\n) to incorporate the value of environmental conservation may lead to the creation of an eleventh cultural value, fostering a long-term understanding of environmental preservation. Furthermore, this newly created cultural value introduces a novel concept of profitability measured by the degree of benefits derived from nature restoration and enhancement of sustainability conditions. In his study advocating for sustainable practices within business sectors, Vuong (\n2021\n) defines profitability as the sum of net environmental value and net monetary profit. This novel perspective on profitability could benefit from the adoption of a model in the management of urban green spaces in Istanbul, one that integrates environmental and social values into operational frameworks.\nFor instance, complaints regarding inadequate facilities and physical attributes of green spaces (such as lack of maintenance or insufficient natural features) could be addressed through the implementation of a semiconductor principle model. This would entail assessing the net environmental value (NEV), which includes contributions such as enhancing public health, reducing urban heat, and increasing social well-being, thereby addressing these spaces’ roles.\nUrban planners can ensure that investments in UGSs, whether through increased funding or public support, align with both the tangible and intangible benefits they provide by capitalizing on these values. Such an approach would not only address immediate visitor complaints but also promote a broader cultural shift towards recognizing and enhancing the true value of green spaces in urban environments.\nMoreover, the integration of eco-surplus culture into UGS management could lead to more sustainable urban environments prioritizing public health and well-being. This cultural shift may encompass community engagement programs that educate and involve the public in green space improvements, thus creating a feedback loop where public interaction directly influences the continuous improvement and sustainability of these areas.\nLimitations and future research\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, the reliance on Google Maps visitor reviews introduces inherent biases, in that the sample is confined to visitors who actively use the platform. This selection bias excludes visitors who may be less technologically inclined or prefer alternative navigation tools, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the broader population. Future research could conduct face-to-face surveys or interview techniques to explore visitor complaints from individuals who are less familiar with technology. Alternative navigation platforms or online review platforms could also be used as data sources to improve the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the study is constrained by its limited geographical scope, as it focuses on nation gardens in Istanbul, an over-urbanized city. Therefore, the findings may not comprehensively represent the experiences and complaints of nation garden visitors in less urbanized cities. Future studies could focus on visitor complaints regarding urban green spaces in less urbanized cities.\nData availability\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nReferences\nAddas A (2023) The importance of urban green spaces in the development of smart cities.

Introduction\nThe rapid urbanization in China over recent decades, coupled with the influx of population into urban centers, has led to the proliferation of high-rise residential clusters, fundamentally transforming the urban landscape (\nTable 1\n) [\n1\n,\n2\n]. These dense developments maximize land use efficiency and provide essential housing, but they have also significantly altered residents’ interactions with their environment. Although China’s construction standards mandate the inclusion of ecological benefits in real estate projects, green spaces are still a scarce resource, particularly in large metropolitan areas. The integration of smart green spaces—green areas augmented with advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, automated irrigation systems, and data-driven environmental management—presents a promising solution to this challenge. These spaces are designed not only to satisfy ecological requirements but also to facilitate residents’ life quality in certain areas [\n3\n]. The existing literature on social sustainability emphasizes the importance of promoting sustainable lifestyles, which are strongly associated with improved well-being. Smart green spaces, with their innovative features such as adaptive shading systems, real-time environmental monitoring, interactive digital interfaces, and responsive lighting, have the potential to significantly enhance both visual and thermal comfort [\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n]. Consequently, they could contribute to a higher quality of life in high-rise residential communities, fostering a more sustainable and environmentally conscious living experience [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n10\n].\nThe field of environmental psychology seeks to elucidate the ways in which individuals interact with built environments. According to Santos, a core principle of environmental psychology is that individuals are naturally embedded in physical environments, where notable reciprocal effects occur between the person and their surroundings [\n11\n]. This hypothesis is a crucial component of residential environmental psychology and behavioral science, focusing on how the structural features of living spaces influence residents’ preferences, decisions, and overall satisfaction [\n12\n]. In another study, Geneshka drew upon insights from environmental psychology to propose an integrated framework for promoting environmental consciousness [\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]. This theoretical model suggests that the integration of green elements, particularly smart green spaces, can reduce the costs associated with pro-environmental behaviors, thereby enhancing their appeal and accessibility through the provision of various technologically-enhanced amenities. Nevertheless, empirical research in this field remains somewhat limited [\n16\n].\nDespite the recognized benefits of traditional green spaces, the connection between smart green spaces and residents’ environmental attitudes, social interactions, and life satisfaction within high-rise living settings remains insufficiently explored. Notably, existing research often emphasizes the physical attributes of green spaces or the general benefits of exposure to natural environments [\n17\n,\n18\n]. However, specific investigations into how smart green spaces impact the living experiences and environmental awareness of high-rise residents, especially from a sustainable and livable standpoint, have been limited [\n19\n].\nIn these contexts, the paper tentatively investigates the influence of smart green spaces on environmental awareness, social cohesion, and life satisfaction among residents of high-rise residential areas and explores how these technologically integrated green spaces can benefit residents by quantifying the psychological and physical satisfaction they bring. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive survey was conducted among residents living in high-rise buildings in selected neighborhoods. The study area is in Guangzhou, one of China’s first-tier cities with a high concentration of population and high-rise buildings [\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n]. Four major aspects were investigated: environmental awareness, the smart green space environment in high-rise residential areas, social cohesion, and individual characteristics of the residents. The research incorporated variables into a questionnaire to quantify data on perceptions of smart green spaces, attitudes toward the environment, social cohesion, and overall life satisfaction by asking respondents to assign values to those variables [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and Pearson correlation analysis were employed to reveal the relationships between these variables. Before conducting the research, four hypotheses were formulated (\nFigure 1\n):\nHypothesis 1 (H1):\nBoth environmental awareness and social cohesion among high-rise residents impact their life satisfaction.\nHypothesis 2 (H2):\nThe smart green space environment in high-rise residential areas is associated with residents’ levels of life satisfaction.\nHypothesis 3 (H3):\nThe smart green space environment affects residents’ life satisfaction through the mediating role of their social cohesion and environmental awareness.\nHypothesis 4 (H4):\nA correlation exists between the individual features of residents and their level of life satisfaction.\nThis research will make a substantial contribution to the existing scholarly literature. Firstly, it broadens the scope of previous studies by investigating the particular influence of smart green spaces on environmental awareness and life satisfaction among high-rise-building residents. Secondly, it emphasizes the necessity of considering the distinctive characteristics of built environments in metropolitan areas, such as a high concentration of population and limited access to nature, when designing and implementing smart public green spaces. Lastly, by understanding how smart green spaces improve urban residents’ life quality, evidence-based strategies can be formulated for future development initiatives [\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n].\n2. Related Literature\nThis section presents a literature review on social sustainability and environmental psychology, aiming to establish the connections between smart green space environments, environmental awareness, social cohesion, and life satisfaction among residents in high-rise residential buildings.\n2.1. The Impact of Smart Green Spaces on Enhancing Life Satisfaction\nThe dominant literature suggests that integrating technology with green elements within public spaces, such as diverse plant life and the quality of the outdoor environment, can significantly enhance health, productivity, and positive perceptions of the surrounding environment among individuals [\n17\n,\n19\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]. For instance, research has revealed that time spent in smart green spaces—where natural elements are augmented with technological features such as IoT-enabled environmental monitoring, automated irrigation, and smart lighting—can lower stress levels and facilitate psychological restoration. These spaces are related to reduced rates of chronic diseases and mental health disorders [\n18\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n]. Furthermore, features such as safety, cleanliness, and the presence of smart ecosystem services have been positively associated with a sense of pleasure and overall well-being among residents [\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n]. The configuration of smart green spaces, including the density of surrounding buildings, the layout of public space, and land-use patterns, can also influence residents’ physical and mental health [\n35\n,\n36\n,\n37\n].\nHowever, the existing literature does not adequately explore the broader impacts of smart green spaces—including the abundance of surrounding smart recreational facilities, the engendered place attachment among individuals, or public memory—on overall life satisfaction [\n38\n,\n39\n,\n40\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n]. Some researchers believe that these factors could be essential. Additionally, the majority of the surveys have been conducted in office buildings, rather than in residential communities [\n44\n,\n45\n]. The activities engaged in by individuals in residential and office buildings are distinct, resulting in disparate evaluations and priorities regarding land-use patterns and environmental features [\n46\n,\n47\n]. The elements of smart green spaces that greatly enhance the well-being of office workers do not necessarily align with those prioritized by residents in high-rise buildings [\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\n,\n52\n]. Furthermore, the green evaluation standards differ between these two environments, leading to varying design priorities and considerations [\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n56\n,\n57\n].\n2.2. Smart Green Spaces, Social Interactions, and Environmental Awareness\nBeyond the health benefits, smart green spaces provide opportunities for social interaction, creating platforms for residents to connect, build relationships, and develop a sense of belonging [\n58\n]. Research has indicated that smart green spaces, enhanced with technological features such as interactive displays and community-based environmental monitoring systems, can contribute to the formation of social networks, enhance trust among neighbors, and strengthen community resilience [\n59\n]. Additionally, studies have shown that these spaces can facilitate intergenerational interactions and foster a sense of shared identity among residents [\n60\n,\n61\n].\nFurthermore, a small number of empirical studies in the field of environmental psychology have investigated the potential influence of smart green spaces on collective environmental action. These studies have explored the impact of technologically integrated and ecologically sustainable environments on the environmental awareness of their occupants [\n62\n]. The provision of opportunities for social interaction and shared experiences in these spaces can facilitate the discussion of environmental issues and the collaborative development of solutions among residents [\n63\n]. This heightened sense of ownership can result in increased participation in environmental initiatives, including community gardening, waste reduction, and energy conservation [\n64\n,\n65\n,\n66\n]. Several studies indicate that the presence of smart green or sustainable features in communities encourages residents to engage in more environmentally friendly behaviors, including improved waste recycling practices, energy saving, and other behaviors that are beneficial to the environment. Specifically, exposure to these smart and nature-enhanced environments can facilitate a connection to the natural world, leading individuals to adopt more sustainable patterns of living [\n67\n,\n68\n]. Moreover, smart green spaces can function as outdoor classrooms, promoting knowledge of biodiversity and the importance of environmental conservation [\n25\n]. Studies have also shown that greenery, especially when combined with educational technology, can enhance individuals’ connection to environmental concerns and activism [\n19\n]. The intersection of smart green spaces with other sustainable elements, such as transportation networks and economic development, is an area that has not been extensively explored, yet it holds potential for revealing the multifaceted contributions of these spaces to living quality [\n66\n]. Addressing these gaps could provide a more nuanced perspective on the value of smart green spaces and inform more effective design and policy strategies for urban environments.\n2.3. The Neighborhood Environment and Social Cohesion in High-Rise Residential Communities\nThe social dynamics and communal well-being within high-rise residential communities are profoundly shaped by both the physical attributes and the perceived qualities of their surrounding neighborhood environment. Specifically, the characteristics of high-rise environments, including vertical density and a large resident population, can present challenges to fostering interpersonal interactions and community bonds, further compounded by the spatial configuration of tall buildings, which may not inherently facilitate unplanned social interactions [\n69\n,\n70\n]. The presence of public entertainment and ecological spaces within these settings has been recognized as a crucial factor, similar to findings in lower-density neighborhoods, in promoting opportunities for social engagement [\n71\n,\n72\n,\n73\n]. There is a positive correlation between environmental appeal, access to communal spaces, social interaction, and resident satisfaction in urban residential areas [\n63\n]. While high-rise residential environments present unique challenges to social cohesion due to their structural and spatial characteristics, strategic planning and design interventions that prioritize green spaces integrated with technologies and accessible communal areas have the potential to mitigate these challenges and foster a sense of community among residents [\n45\n]. Additionally, there is a dearth of research on the influence of cultural factors and community-specific norms on the use and perception of smart green spaces in high-rise communities, which could inform more culturally sensitive design strategies [\n74\n,\n75\n,\n76\n,\n77\n].\nIn conclusion, the existing literature offers insights into the theoretical connections among smart green spaces, environmental awareness, social interactions, and life satisfaction [\n78\n,\n79\n,\n80\n,\n81\n,\n82\n]. However, the literature is deficient in its examination and establishment of the specific mechanisms through which smart green spaces impact residents’ well-being, social cohesion, and environmental awareness in high-rise residential communities, particularly regarding the provision of detailed empirical evidence (\nTable 2\n).\n3. Statistics and Methodology\n3.1. Case Study\nThis study focuses on residents of high-rise residential areas within Guangzhou. Data were collected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Field observations, structured interviews, and surveys were conducted among individuals residing in diverse high-rise residential communities across Guangzhou (\nFigure 2\n) [\n35\n,\n44\n]. Sample selection adhered to stringent criteria to ensure the rigor and applicability of findings:\n(1)\nGeographical focus: This study concentrated on primary urban districts known for high-density residential development, including Tianhe District, Yuexiu District, and Liwan District. These areas collectively accommodate a significant proportion of Guangzhou’s population and exhibit varying degrees of urban development and community infrastructure, making them ideal places for examining the integration and effects of smart green spaces.\n(2)\nSelection of communities: High-rise residential complexes constructed between 2000 and 2020 were targeted, focusing on those with established smart green spaces and communal facilities. Emphasis was placed on communities with advanced environmental amenities, incorporating technological innovations such as IoT systems for environmental monitoring and automated maintenance, reflecting a spectrum of architectural layouts and smart environmental design approaches related to community engagement and well-being.\n(3)\nSampling criteria: Communities exhibiting a minimum occupancy rate of 75% were selected for inclusion in this study, as this threshold is believed to show a realistic representation of typical living conditions and dynamics. Additionally, communities comprising a diverse demographic profile were chosen, reflecting the inclusion of residents from a broad range of social backgrounds and household structures.\n(4)\nCharacteristics of participants: The research intentionally included participants representing a range of ages, socio-economic statuses, and household compositions, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of how smart green spaces impact residents’ perceptions and experiences of environmental awareness, social cohesion, and overall life satisfaction.\n3.2. Surveys\nThe data collection for this study involved a structured approach combining questionnaires and field interviews conducted within selected high-rise residential communities. In May 2024, a number of researchers and graduate students from the University of Hong Kong and South China Agriculture University formed interview teams distributed across seven strategically chosen communities. The sample selection employed random sampling techniques, focusing on residents who were actively engaged with smart green spaces. Participation was voluntary, and individuals who declined cited various reasons, including time constraints and personal commitments unrelated to this study’s focus.\nIn total, 450 questionnaires were distributed, and 392 responses were received. After meticulous scrutiny for completeness and accuracy, 375 valid responses formed the basis of the analysis. The survey aimed to investigate several key aspects related to the influence of smart green spaces:\n(1)\nDemographic and behavioral profiling: A thorough examination of the demographic profiles and behavioral patterns of residents was conducted to gain insights into the utilization of smart green spaces and their impact on community well-being.\n(2)\nEnvironmental assessment: The classification of smart green spaces into distinct categories—such as recreational facilities, aesthetic features, and ecological diversity with integrated technological features—allowed for their perceptual and functional significance in fostering environmental awareness and social cohesion to be evaluated.\n(3)\nQuality-of-life metrics: The assessment of residents’ perceptions incorporated an examination of how smart green spaces contribute to overall life satisfaction. This was achieved through the measurement of psychological comfort, social interaction facilitation, and environmental stewardship, which were enhanced by greenery and smart technologies.\nThe questionnaire was designed with the objective of obtaining detailed responses that would facilitate a thorough investigation of the influence of smart green spaces on environmental awareness, social cohesion, and life satisfaction in high-rise residential settings.\n3.3. Structural Equation Models (SEM)\nBuilding upon the existing literature on the relationships between urban environments and well-being in high-rise residential contexts, this study explores the complex interplay of internal and external factors influencing the well-being of residents. Internal factors include demographic characteristics such as age, gender, educational attainment, and income level. External factors involve the physical attributes of the high-rise residential environment, including the perception of safety, features of the smart green spaces, and the availability of recreational facilities. These elements collectively shape the subjective cognitive states of residents, thereby impacting life satisfaction.\nDirectly assessing latent constructs such as well-being and social cohesion in urban environmental research presents challenges, necessitating the use of observable indicators as proxies. Structural equation modeling (SEM) emerges as a qualified statistical method for such inquiries, enabling simultaneous examination of latent constructs and their observable manifestations. This study advances theoretical frameworks by investigating how objective features of high-rise residential environments, particularly smart green spaces, interact with subjective perceptions to influence overall well-being. The SEM framework developed here integrates multivariate latent constructs related to smart green spaces and resident characteristics. Guided by established hypotheses, an empirically validated indicator system, and rigorous statistical analyses using software such as AMOS 24, the SEM model is constructed following methodological guidelines outlined by notable researchers.\nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was utilized to assess the standardized loadings of all latent constructs, ensuring measurement reliability and construct validity. Composite reliability (CR) was employed to evaluate internal consistency, with average variance extracted (AVE) gauged to assess convergent validity. The model demonstrates an acceptable fit with factor loadings ranging from 0.45 to 0.95, with all latent constructs meeting the requisite criteria for reliability and validity. This affirms the capacity of the SEM framework to elucidate the dynamics of life satisfaction in high-rise residential environments influenced by smart green spaces.\n4. Results\nThis study began with Pearson correlation tests to assess multicollinearity and verify preliminary relationships.\nFigure 3\nvisually represents the correlation analysis among several variables pertinent to individual characteristics and the smart green spaces’ environment indices, such as gender, age, monthly income, type of residential housing, spatial openness, interactivity of digital interfaces, sense of belonging, and life satisfaction. Notably, prior research, including the study by Longato [\n83\n], suggests a lack of significant relationship between certain variables related to social cohesion and well-being among residents, which led to their exclusion from further analysis.\nThe heatmap reveals several significant correlations. For example, the type of residential housing exhibits a mildly positive correlation with recycling behavior (0.14) and a strong positive correlation with life satisfaction (0.39), suggesting that individuals might be more content with their lives and more inclined to promote environmental protection due to better housing accommodation or accumulated wealth. Furthermore, the spatial openness of smart green spaces shows a moderate correlation with a sense of belonging (0.23), indicating that open spaces integrated with advanced digital ecosystems and smart green infrastructure can still foster a sense of community and attachment in high-density urban environments.\nBuilding on the preliminary findings from the Pearson correlation analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to delve deeper into the relationships between variables. SEM is particularly suitable for larger samples and multiple dependent variables, as it enables the examination of complex interrelationships and mediation effects among variables, providing a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This analytical approach was deemed especially appropriate for this study, given its comprehensive scope and the necessity to elucidate the intricate dynamics between smart green spaces and life satisfaction [\n49\n].\nThe SEM results emphasize the significant influence of smart green spaces on life satisfaction, mediated through social cohesion, technological interactivity, and environmental awareness (\nTable 3\n). Social cohesion emerges as the most potent predictor of life satisfaction, with a standardized coefficient of 0.561, emphasizing the critical role of community bonds, enhanced by smart green spaces, in promoting residents’ well-being. Environmental awareness also shows a positive impact, with a coefficient of 0.263, indicating that it serves as a mild mediator between smart green spaces and life satisfaction, reinforcing the importance of eco-consciousness in urban environments. Moreover, the direct impact of smart green spaces on life satisfaction, as indicated by a coefficient of 0.282, is further enhanced by their positive effect on social cohesion, technological interactivity, and environmental awareness. The findings lend substantial support to the hypothesis that smart green spaces not only confer direct benefits to residents but also promote community engagement and facilitate environmental consciousness, both of which contribute to higher life satisfaction. These insights are of vital importance for the development of cohesive and technologically integrated communities and the advancement of sustainable urban planning [\n74\n,\n84\n].\nThe findings in\nFigure 4\nreveal that intimacy with smart green spaces and the interactivity of digital interfaces exhibit the strongest positive correlations with environmental awareness. This suggests that residents who perceive the green spaces as visually appealing and technologically engaging are more likely to develop a heightened sense of environmental consciousness. The presence of aesthetically pleasing landscapes, coupled with interactive features such as real-time environmental data displays and user-friendly digital platforms, appears to foster a deeper connection between residents and their surroundings [\n85\n]. This connection might contribute to a greater awareness of environmental issues and a stronger inclination towards sustainable practices. In addition to aesthetics and interactivity, the use of natural lighting and the frequency of communication with neighbors show moderate positive correlations with environmental awareness. These findings suggest that the design of smart green spaces, which incorporates natural elements such as sunlight and promotes social interactions, can also play a significant role in enhancing residents’ environmental awareness [\n71\n]. While these factors are not as influential as aesthetics and interactivity, they nonetheless contribute to an environment that encourages sustainable living. Interestingly, demographic variables such as gender, age, and educational level do not exhibit strong correlations with environmental awareness.\nFigure 5\nfocuses on the factors that influence the overall perception of smart green spaces’ environment. The analysis reveals that the capability and efficiency of smart ecosystem services along with the accessibility of these green spaces are the most influential variables. These findings highlight the importance of functionality and ease of access in creating a positive environmental experience. Residents are more likely to benefit from and appreciate green spaces that are not only easily accessible but also equipped with efficient and effective ecosystem services, such as automated irrigation systems, adaptive lighting, and real-time environmental monitoring. Automation of smart lighting and the type of residential housing show moderate correlations with the environment of smart green spaces. These results suggest that while technological integration is crucial, the type of housing—whether it be high-rise apartments or more traditional residential buildings—also plays a role in shaping residents’ perceptions of their environment [\n86\n]. The combination of advanced technology and appropriate housing types contributes to a more cohesive and functional green space environment.\n5. Discussion\nThe diversity of smart activity facilities and the spatial openness of smart green spaces emerge as the variables mildly correlated with social cohesion, as illustrated by\nFigure 6\n. These findings underscore the importance of providing a variety of recreational opportunities and maintaining open, accessible spaces to foster community bonds. In environments where residents have access to diverse activities and open areas, there is a greater likelihood of increased social interactions, leading to stronger community ties and a sense of belonging [\n87\n]. Residents who feel digitally integrated into their community are more likely to engage in both virtual and physical social activities, creating a supportive and inclusive environment [\n88\n]. And it is noteworthy that the individual features “the use of natural lighting” and “intimacy with smart green spaces” are also critical factors that positively impact social cohesion. Similarly, frequency of communication with neighbors emerges as an important predictor of social interactions. This result exhibits the importance of technology-enhanced social interaction in fostering a sense of belonging and community. Regular interactions through smart spaces’ environment can lead to the development of robust social networks, which are essential for emotional support and mental health. On the other hand, the classification of rubbish and the use of public transportation exhibit weaker correlations with social cohesion. While these factors are valued for their environmental benefits, their direct impact on fostering social connections within the community appears to be less pronounced [\n89\n].\nAccording to the data presented in\nFigure 7\n, the findings reveal that the integration of smart green spaces and social cohesion factors within high-rise residential communities significantly enhances life satisfaction, with substantial positive coefficients. This suggests that the more intimate the interaction between residents and smart green spaces, the higher the level of life satisfaction they experience. This relationship can be attributed to the multifaceted benefits that smart green spaces offer, such as the provision of digitally enabled recreational opportunities, dynamic aesthetic features, and the fostering of a digitally interconnected community environment. Several environmentally conscious behaviors, such as minimizing plastic bag usage, utilizing public transportation, and participating in recycling programs, have been observed to exert a positive, albeit modest, influence on life satisfaction, with a coefficient of around 0.1. This finding suggests that smart green spaces, which actively promote and facilitate these behaviors through digital nudges and information dissemination, can foster a sense of personal responsibility and community pride, ultimately enhancing overall well-being. However, the influence of specific variables, such as the utilization of smart natural ventilation and automated lighting systems, appears to be inconsequential, with a coefficient of approximately 0. This may be due to the fact that these smart features do not directly impact the daily lives of residents in a significant way or may be overshadowed by other more prominent factors within the community environment.\nA number of recurrent features emerge from a holistic review of the impact variables data presented (\nFigure 4\n,\nFigure 5\n,\nFigure 6\nand\nFigure 7\n). Aesthetic appeal and technological integration demonstrate a consistently strong positive correlation with environmental awareness, the quality of the smart green spaces’ environment, social cohesion, and life satisfaction. These findings emphasize the pivotal role that design and technology play in shaping the overall experience of residents in high-rise residential communities. Furthermore, the accessibility and functionality of smart green spaces are also common factors that influence both the environment of the spaces and the social dynamics within the community. In contrast, demographic variables such as age, gender, and educational level do not demonstrate robust correlations, indicating that the influence of smart green spaces is relatively universal across diverse demographic groups. However, there is a phenomenon where individuals with low self-rated health report higher life satisfaction and social cohesion, probably due to the fact that some of them tend to maintain a positive outlook and derive meaning and satisfaction from their surrounding environment. The integration of smart green spaces, which enhance intimacy with green areas and strengthen the sense of belonging to communities, may play a key role in this process [\n88\n,\n89\n,\n90\n].\n6. Conclusions\nBy examining both objective and subjective perceptions, this study uncovers how certain attributes of smart green space environments—such as perceptual accessibility, technological diversity, and enhanced safety features—interact with social cohesion and pro-environmental behavioral patterns. The principal conclusions may be summarized as follows (\nFigure 8\n):\n(1)\nThe intimacy between residents and smart green spaces shows a strong positive correlation with life satisfaction. The proximity to and engagement with smart green spaces not only improve the aesthetic appeal of the environment through interactive and adaptive design features but also serve as catalysts for social interactions and community cohesion. Specifically, the integration of smart technologies, such as sensor-activated lighting, automated maintenance systems, and diverse digital interfaces, within high-rise residential areas enhances residents’ daily experiences and promotes a sense of place attachment, reinforcing their satisfaction with urban living.\n(2)\nThe significant influence of environmental awareness and social cohesion on life satisfaction in high-rise residential areas is self-evident. The heightened environmental awareness among residents, fostered by some smart systems that provide real-time data on environmental quality and energy use, instills a sense of responsibility towards sustainable living practices and environmental conservation, further reinforcing their satisfaction with the ecological integrity of their residential environment. Moreover, strong social cohesion within communities, enhanced by smart platforms for social networking and community participation, cultivates a sense of belonging and trust among residents, which is crucial for buffering against stressors and enhancing overall psychological well-being. Residents who feel socially connected through these smart features tend to engage in collective neighborhood activities that improve their living environment, thereby contributing to higher levels of life satisfaction.\n(3)\nSmart green spaces enhance life satisfaction by fostering social cohesion as a mediating path. These technologically integrated environments serve as central hubs for communal gatherings, fostering regular social interactions and promoting neighborhood cohesion. Residents who frequently engage in activities within these spaces, supported by smart scheduling systems and interactive event-planning tools, cultivate shared experiences and develop strong social bonds, which collectively contribute to the formation of a supportive community network. This accumulated social capital, bolstered by smart technologies, enhances residents’ sense of belonging and collective efficacy, thereby positively influencing their overall life satisfaction.\n(4)\nThe hypothesis that individual characteristics influence residents’ life satisfaction has been validated. Individual factors, including age, socioeconomic status, and personal preferences, have been demonstrated to influence perceptions of living suitability and residential satisfaction. For example, residents with higher incomes may demonstrate a preference for smart green spaces that offer exclusive digital amenities or luxury smart features, which contribute to their sense of prestige and satisfaction.\nIn summary, this study emphasizes the crucial role of smart green spaces within high-rise residential communities. It not only enhances the aesthetic and functional appeal of the residential community but also incorporates advanced sustainability initiatives, such as smart ecosystem services and automated recreational facilities, that foster environmental consciousness and a sense of community attachment through digitally supported behaviors in high-rise areas. Urban planners are supposed to prioritize the seamless integration of smart green spaces into the fabric of high-rise residential areas, ensuring that these spaces are not only visually appealing but also functionally beneficial through technological innovations that enhance user experience and environmental values. The deployment of smart technologies that tailor the environment to individual needs can facilitate the creation of inclusive urban environments. These technologies may include adaptive lighting, automated mobility assistance, and personalized digital interfaces. Furthermore, the necessity of engaging residents in the design and planning process is corroborated, thereby ensuring that their needs and preferences inform the urban landscape. The incorporation of feedback through the utilization of participatory design tools enables urban planners to create more effective and sustainable urban spaces that reflect the collective vision of the community, thereby fostering a heightened sense of ownership and satisfaction.\nOne of the most notable limitations of this study is its reliance on cross-sectional data, which provides a static snapshot rather than a dynamic view of how smart green spaces influence life satisfaction over time. It would be beneficial for future research to track residents’ perceptions and experiences over time, with a specific focus on how the evolving technological capabilities of smart green spaces impact social cohesion, environmental awareness, and, ultimately, long-term life satisfaction and well-being. This approach is of great consequence for the formulation of sustainable urban planning and policy-making decisions, which are aimed at optimizing the health values of smart green spaces within rapidly changing and developing metropolitan areas.\nAuthor Contributions\nY.L.

Introduction\nUrban greening is a major goal in policies for sustainable cities [\n1\n,\n2\n], and the use of urban green space (UGS) to address health and well-being issues related to urban spatial design, such as heat stress and mental stress, is increasingly advocated for [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n]. Hence, urban policy makers and spatial planners have developed a strong interest in using urban greening for the benefit of resident well-being and urban sustainability [\n8\n,\n9\n]. Currently, most science-based guidelines and urban policies deal with the various health benefits and burdens of UGS separately [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. For example, the impacts of UGS on heat stress in the context of climate adaptation are addressed in isolation from other relevant UGS impacts on urban health [\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]. Moreover, guidelines are often unclear about the quantitative dimension, e.g., how much UGS is needed in a city or neighborhood to achieve a desired level of health benefits. Additionally, urban planners are confronted with contradictory messages because UGS can also have negative consequences for human health through impacts on, for example, pollen concentration and social safety, and the issue- and situation-specific nature of available guidelines and support tools further add to the complexity of UGS planning to promote residents’ health and well-being [\n16\n].\nA spatial model named Urban-EcoMATCH (Urban Ecosystems Mapping and Assessment Tool of Costs and Benefits for Health), presented in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n], however, offers the possibility to support the development of ‘healthy’ urban greening strategies in an integrated, quantitative, and context-specific way, accounting for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. In this study, the model is applied to assess the performance of alternative UGS design scenarios as compared to the current situation. This explorative strategic scenario study [\n18\n] aims to answer ‘what-if’ questions regarding UGS design for a concrete, specific case (the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands) but also to generate broader insights concerning effective urban greening strategies with respect to health and climate resilience. With its integrated approach, the study fills a gap left by recent scenario-based assessments of UGS design [\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n], which focused on certain specific benefits of UGS, such as promoting active transport [\n24\n] or adapting to climate change by reducing heat stress [\n25\n] or the risks of urban flooding [\n26\n]. The study also covers several health issues that, thus far, have not been addressed in other UGS scenario-based assessments, namely, the effects of UGS on mental stress from visually unattractive cityscapes, social safety, and tick-borne infectious diseases.\nIn the next sections, we first present the study approach and introduce the UGS design scenarios, which will be assessed with respect to human health and well-being. Then, we describe the results of this integrated scenario assessment. In the final section, we discuss the major findings and their implications for urban greening strategies, as well as the limitations of the study in this regard. We end with a conclusion on the value of the presented approach and on priorities for further research.\n2. Methods\nIn this section, we first briefly describe the scenario study approach and input data. Then, we explain in more detail the different UGS design scenarios that were assessed with the model and the thresholds used in this assessment.\n2.1. Scenario Study Approach and Input Data\nFor each of the four UGS design scenarios, including two alternative greening strategy scenarios, the indicator values of five health determinants were estimated per street segment, with the spatial model described in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]. These five health determinants concerned ‘Unattractive views’, ‘Heat stress’, ‘Air pollution’, ‘Perceived unsafety’, and ‘Tick-bite risk’. The UGS contributions to these determinants were calculated by comparing the determinant values in the ‘Current greenspace’, ‘Green parking lots and squares’, and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios with the values in the ‘No greenspace’ scenario. The performance of the two alternative greening strategy scenarios (‘Green parking lots and squares’, ‘Optimized greenspace locations’) was assessed relative to the current situation (‘Current greenspace’) and relative to each other.\nFor the scenario assessment, overall, city-scale indicator values for the five health determinants were calculated as the area-weighted average of the indicator values for all street segments. Furthermore, for each street segment, the model-estimated indicator values of the health determinants were compared with a pre-set threshold value. With these thresholds, an additional indicator of the health effects of each scenario was calculated: the number (and proportion) of street segments where the indicator value of a health determinant exceeded the threshold. This may be a more policy-relevant indicator to compare the UGS design scenarios because locations where one or more thresholds are exceeded are likely to attract the attention of urban policy makers and planners. The value of this indicator will not differ between scenarios if differences in UGS impacts, as reflected in different average indicator values, do not result in more or less exceedance of the threshold.\nTo generate the UGS design for the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario, a module was added to the original model (\nFigure 1\n). Further information on the model, as well as a detailed description of the five health determinants included, can be found in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]. To run the spatial model, we used several input datasets that are all publicly available for the full Dutch territory and that are often high in resolution (<1 m). See Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n] for a more elaborate description of the input data.\nThe case study area for this scenario study is the built-up area of Maastricht, The Netherlands. It is a city in the south of the Netherlands, with 122,000 inhabitants [\n27\n]. Within the Netherlands, Maastricht is an interesting case in which to apply the model, primarily because it has a heterogeneous urban morphology. We used data from the year 2018 for all datasets. For a further description of reasons to focus on Maastricht and its health situation related to the assessed health benefits and burdens, see Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n].\nFigure 2\npresents a map of the study area, including the borders of the built-up area and the buffer area for geo-processing, as well as the location of the example areas that we use to visualize the results.\n2.2. UGS Design Scenarios\nThis section introduces the UGS design scenarios for which health impacts were assessed with the model. For all scenarios, privately-owned UGSs were included, but only UGSs in public areas and areas of private owners accessible to the public (pedestrians) were changed in the alternative UGS design scenarios. As such, these scenarios only include design options that are—in principle—within the power of urban spatial planners to implement. For a visual impression of the four UGS design scenarios at street level, see\nFigure 3\n.\n2.2.1. Scenario ‘No Greenspace’\nThis scenario assumes that Maastricht does not have any public UGS at all. Trees are removed, and currently (year 2018) existing shrubs, herbs, and grass are replaced by sealed soil. This scenario represents the so-called reference scenario, which is used to estimate the UGS contributions to health in the other scenarios. This is conducted by calculating the difference between the health determinant indicator values estimated in this reference scenario and those in the scenarios with greenspace.\n2.2.2. ‘Current Greenspace’ Scenario\nIn this scenario, aerial imagery and topographic maps were combined to reconstruct the UGS situation for the built-up area of Maastricht in the year 2018 (see Appendix B in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]). Other elements of the spatial design of Maastricht that influence health determinants, for example, those related to buildings, roads, and cars, were also extracted from the 2018 datasets.\n2.2.3. ‘Green Parking Lots and Squares’ Scenario\nMaastricht’s urban planners have the ambition to green part of the less used parking lots, as well as part of the city’s squares, and they are interested in what effects this may have on health benefits and burdens [\n28\n]. As we expected that the city-scale effects on health determinants of the original plans would be very small, we developed a scenario that represents a more extreme version of this ambition, in which all parking lots are replaced by grass fields with shrubs, and all squares are replaced by grass fields with trees. The purpose of this more extreme version of the planners’ ambition is to determine the potential of this greening strategy. The greening of all parking lots and squares would add 4% additional UGS cover, expressed as a percentage of Maastricht’s built-up area in 2018.\nAnticipating a preference of residents for an open landscape, shrubs added in this scenario were of a modest size (1.2 m in height). Moreover, in line with the municipality’s ambition to increase urban biodiversity, larger trees (20 m in diameter, 12 m in height) were added where space allowed this, reasoning that one large tree increases biodiversity more than two smaller trees.\n2.2.4. ‘Optimized Greenspace Locations’ Scenario\nThis scenario uses the UGS volume (i.e., number and size of UGS elements) from the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario but employs the computer model to redistribute the current UGS over the built-up area of Maastricht to optimize health benefits. All health determinants have the same priority in this scenario: UGS will be located (‘planted’) in areas with an equally high suitability for each of the UGS benefits and an equally low suitability for each of the UGS burdens (see\nBox 1\nfor further explanation). In contrast to the scenario ‘Greening of parking lots and squares’, this scenario does not add any UGS elements compared to the 2018 situation. Hence, the purpose of this scenario is to show the potential benefits of the same amount of UGS when locations are chosen such that health benefits are maximized and burdens minimized.\nBox 1.\nProcessing steps to create the urban green space design scenario, ‘Optimized greenspace locations’.\nStep 1:\nFirstly, we identified areas in Maastricht’s built-up area that may have potential for UGS (re)design. We only selected public areas and areas of private owners that are accessible to the public (pedestrians). Within these areas, we selected areas that were not covered by water, buildings, or roads (including footpaths), such as squares, lawns, herbaceous areas, hedges, areas planted with trees, parking lots, squares, and paved areas around buildings. See\nFigure 4\nA for an example of the location, number, and size of these areas in this ‘potential UGS areas map’.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, we constructed a separate ‘UGS location suitability map’ for each of the five health determinants. This location suitability map was created by running the model for all locations within the potential UGS areas map from Step 1 and calculating the UGS contribution. Subsequently, (detrimental) health determinant indicator values for the UGS contribution were inverted and normalized to range 0–1 by setting the highest value in the study area to zero (the most detrimental health effects and lowest suitability) and the lowest value to one (least detrimental health effects, highest suitability). In this ‘location suitability map’, the lowest suitability values result from no/lowest beneficial UGS effects or highest detrimental UGS effects in the case of health-related burdens and vice versa. For example, for the UGS location suitability map for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’, the lowest suitability scores were assigned to all locations that would not at all be visible by pedestrians. See\nFigure 4\nB,C for examples of tree location suitability maps for the health determinants ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nStep 3:\nNext, we calculated the total area covered by tree crowns within UGS design scenario, ‘Current green space’ (representing the situation in 2018). Subsequently, an area with the highest suitability scores for all health determinants was selected, with the size of this area being just sufficiently large enough to accommodate the total tree crown area. The result was a ‘highest benefits and lowest burdens map’ with sufficient space to accommodate all trees from the current UGS scenario (\nFigure 4\nD). Hence, this map indicates the potential UGS areas that are most suitable to accommodate the total area covered by trees in the most ‘healthy’ way. A similar procedure was implemented to identify the most suitable potential UGS areas to accommodate the other UGS types: shrubs, herbs, and grass (see\nAppendix A\n). Finally, the model was run for all UGS types at these ‘optimal’ locations together to take the effect of possible UGS interactions into account.\nFigure 4.\nExamples illustrating, for example, area 1 with the stepwise method to identify areas highly suitable for trees in view of multiple health determinants. (\nA\n) ‘Potential UGS areas map’. (\nB\n) ‘Location suitability map’ for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’. (\nC\n) ‘Location suitability map’ for health determinant ‘Air pollution’. (\nD\n) ‘High benefits and low burdens map’ for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nFigure 4.\nExamples illustrating, for example, area 1 with the stepwise method to identify areas highly suitable for trees in view of multiple health determinants.

(\nD\n) ‘High benefits and low burdens map’ for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nIn Maastricht’s built-up area, the space available for optimizing UGS in support of residents’ health is rather limited, especially in the city center. In 2018, grass, herbs, and shrubs covered 30% of the built-up area (including both public and private UGS), whilst tree crowns covered 15%. As tree stems do not take up much space, about 30–31% of the surface cover of the built-up area was covered by UGS. Only 8% of the built-up area’s surface is covered by areas that have potential for implementing UGS (re)design. This is mainly because 41% of Maastricht’s built-up area consists of roads, buildings, and water. Moreover, 21% of the built-up area consists of private areas without UGS that are not accessible to the public. The surface of such private areas mainly consists of paved area (roads, parking lots) or storage area (e.g., for sand and building materials). We assume that the space available for optimizing UGS in other cities in the Netherlands will not differ greatly from the Maastricht case.\nThe ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario was generated with module 9 (\nFigure 1\n). The process of determining optimal UGS locations can be divided into three distinct steps, which are described in\nBox 1\nand\nFigure 4\n. We will explain Steps 2 and 3 using specific examples of location optimization for trees and for the health determinants ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nAppendix A\nexplains the geoprocessing methods applied in these steps in detail, including all parameter values and sources used.\n2.3. Threshold Values to Assess and Compare UGS Design Scenarios\nTo assess the health impacts of the UGS design scenarios, the model-estimated indicator values of the health determinants were compared with threshold values for each health determinant (see\nTable 1\n). The chosen thresholds have different origins. The heat stress and air pollution thresholds were based on peer-reviewed literature and official WHO guidelines, respectively [\n29\n,\n30\n]. However, it should be noted that these choices are still pragmatic to a certain extent. Regarding the threshold for air pollution, the NO\n2\nconcentration, below which health effects do not occur, is much lower and often below background values [\n31\n]. Regarding the threshold for heat stress, temperatures above 35 °C PET are already categorized as ‘strong heat stress’ [\n29\n], and this level is easily met for every street segment during a heatwave day in Maastricht. For example, air temperature at the hottest heatwave day in 2018 reached 37.5 °C [\n32\n], and the model-estimated values for all street segments of Maastricht were above 35 °C PET. ‘Extreme Heat Stress Level 2’ (and not Level 1 or 3) was chosen to make differences between UGS design scenarios visible: it is a threshold value for which the frequency of exceedance varies between 0 and 100 percent for all scenarios. The thresholds for unattractive views, perceived (social) unsafety, and tick-bite risk are based on intuitive cut-off values. Unattractive view indicator values above zero mean that unattractive objects are more dominant within the pedestrian’s field of view than attractive objects, so these areas are scored as ‘net unattractive’. A perceived social unsafety score of 50 is right in between the minimum and maximum scores, so a street segment with this score would be perceived as neither really safe nor really unsafe. Finally, a threshold value of 1% for a tick-bite risk may intuitively make sense, as people seem to perceive chances larger than one percent as being much more significant in general [\n33\n]. This indicator can be considered the chance of being bitten during May to September, the period during which ticks are most active [\n34\n].\n3. Results\n3.1. Greenspace Design Per Scenario\nTo show how the different scenarios work in greenspace design, example area 1 is used to illustrate the differences. Example area 1, located in the city center, can, on a more general level, be regarded as representative of the entire built-up area of Maastricht. It contains types of footpath surroundings that are dominant in the city, such as residential roads, more central local roads with a high traffic intensity, and squares. However, example area 1 does not include a park, whilst the city contains several parks. This also explains why the fraction of open area (the area without buildings/total area) is lower than that in the entire built-up area of Maastricht (70% vs. 82%). However, the differences in UGS design that we discuss below are illustrative for the entire built-up area of Maastricht and apply to other areas in the city as well.\nFigure 5\nshows the green space design in example area 1 for the reference scenario (\nFigure 5\nA), as well as for the three UGS design scenarios (\nFigure 5\nB–D). The ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario (\nFigure 5\nC) shows the effect of replacing all parking lots with grass fields with shrubs and all squares with grass fields with trees. Compared with the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario (\nFigure 5\nB), these areas are added as greenspace areas. However, for the entire built-up area of Maastricht, the part taken up by parking lots and squares is small (4%), so health effects can be expected to be relatively small as well. Moreover, most parking lots are individual (dispersed) parking lots alongside and mostly parallel to the road. In these areas, there is often only space to add just one type of UGS. In these cases, we added only shrubs (hedgerows), as their volume is higher than that of mown grass. This potentially yields more benefits than mown grass in terms of reducing heat stress, unattractive views, and air pollution. Comparing the ‘Current greenspace’ (\nFigure 5\nB) and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios (\nFigure 5\nD) shows that in the optimized scenario, fewer trees and more hedgerows are located next to roads that are more traffic intensive. The opposite is true for less busy roads, such as residential streets, which now contain more trees and less hedgerows next to roads. Furthermore, in the scenario ‘Optimized greenspace locations’, squares are populated with more trees and filled with herbs and grass around these trees, while in parks, shrubs and herbs are removed from below trees. Trees further away from footpaths are partially removed as well and moved closer to footpaths, for example, in residential areas. Finally, in all types of footpath surroundings, trees, shrubs, and grass were relocated somewhat closer to footpaths.\n3.2. Health Benefits and Burdens Per Scenario\nTable 2\npresents the results regarding health benefits and burdens and the associated contributions of UGS for the reference scenario (‘No greenspace’) and the three UGS design scenarios (‘Current green space’; ‘Green parking lots and squares’; ‘Optimized greenspace locations’).\nFigure 6\n,\nFigure 7\n,\nFigure 8\n,\nFigure 9\nand\nFigure 10\nshow these results at a neighborhood scale (within the example areas) to give an impression of local variation in the values of health determinants and UGS contributions. In these figures and table, the UGS contributions are expressed such that negative values should be interpreted as beneficial for human health because they reduce detrimental health determinant values. Vice versa, positive UGS contribution values should be interpreted as detrimental for human health. Values for health determinants, such as unattractive views, can also be negative, which should be interpreted as beneficial for health as well, as negative scores mean that attractive objects are more dominant for a certain footpath segment.\nOverall,\nTable 2\nshows that with the current UGS design of Maastricht’s built-up area, numerous street segments exceed the threshold values (provided in\nTable 1\n). Yet, for heat stress and unattractive views, the average indicator value and, in particular, the exceedance frequency is reduced compared to the ‘No greenspace’ scenario, indicating substantial health benefits of the current UGS. For perceived unsafety and tick-bite risk, and, to a lesser extent, for air pollution, the average indicator value and exceedance frequency are higher, indicating that current UGS has a detrimental effect on health with respect to these determinants. Compared to the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario, implementation of the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario is estimated to result in a further decrease in heat stress and unattractive views and a slight increase in perceived unsafety and tick-bite risk. The UGS contribution to air pollution remains relatively small but changes from a burden into a benefit. The implementation of the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario is estimated to only slightly increase the perceived unsafety whilst (beneficially) decreasing the indicator values of the four other health determinants. This translates into even stronger reductions in the number of street segments that exceed threshold levels, especially for heat stress, unattractive views, and tick-bite risk. However, for unattractive views, the exceedance frequency did not decrease as much as in the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario. This is because street segments that scored lower (i.e., were considered more attractive) in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario were mainly those that already scored below the unattractive views threshold in the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario.\nThe following paragraphs detail the changes in UGS design and their associated effects on health determinants for the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios in both cases in comparison to the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario.\n3.2.1. Detailed Results for the ‘Green Parking Lots and Squares’ Scenario\nThe strategy of greening all parking lots and squares adds 4% additional UGS cover, expressed as a percentage of Maastricht’s built-up area in 2018. In this UGS design scenario, pedestrians are better shielded from air pollution through hedgerows that replaced parking lots, especially close to roads with high traffic intensity. Since the hedgerows and shrubs were not too tall, the perceived unsafety did not increase much, as the view and sightline are only slightly blocked by the hedgerows (only directly behind the hedgerow). Some neighborhoods, however, have shaded parking lots in areas that qualify as potential tick habitat. Adding shrubs to these parking lots increased the estimated tick-bite risk in these areas. The greening of squares and larger parking lots notably decreased the score for unattractive views. The number of larger squares in Maastricht that were filled with grass and trees was small, but where they were present, this also led to a local reduction in heat stress due to the combined effect of tree shading and reduced thermal radiation from the grass.\n3.2.2. Detailed Results for the ‘Optimized Greenspace Locations’ Scenario\nIn the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario, the optimization method moved trees out of street canyons with traffic-intensive roads. This resulted in a smaller local street canyon effect, reducing local pedestrian-level air pollution (see\nFigure 8\n). Although the absence of trees at these locations resulted in increased local heat stress, it did not result in an increase in the average heat stress at the neighborhood and city scale since a large part of these trees was relocated to nearby streets with less car emissions, such as residential roads. At these locations, those trees often had a slightly lower (because such streets are often already slightly more shaded through buildings) but still substantial effect on decreasing heat stress. The optimization method also moved trees that were located further away from footpaths to less traffic-intensive streets, where they were more effective in reducing unattractive views and heat stress. Similar to the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario, shrubs were located alongside busy roads instead of, for example, solitary shrubs alongside less busy roads or further away from footpaths. This mainly decreased air pollution but also (to a lesser extent) decreased heat stress and unattractive views. Where possible, trees and shrubs located further away from footpaths, as well as trees from street canyons, were relocated adjacent to busy roads with an open road situation. As such, they formed vegetation barriers, reducing air pollution levels. However, this form of location optimization was not often implemented, because in most busy streets the distance between road and footpath was often too small to do this. Relocating shrubs and herbs, mainly from park-like areas to squares, reduced both unattractive views and heat stress. Overall, relocating UGS in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario especially had an effect on unattractive views and heat stress: threshold exceedance for unattractive views was reduced from 87% to 16%, whereas heat stress was reduced by about 3 °C PET.\nSimilar to the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario, perceived unsafety only slightly increased. This can be explained by two factors: (1) relocated hedgerows only slightly blocked the view and sightline of pedestrians, and (2) only trees with high crowns were moved closer to pedestrian areas. Another reason why perceived unsafety only showed a slight increase is that the optimization method replaced trees closer to the footpath with low tree crowns as well as tall shrubs with trees with high tree crowns. In contrast with the UGS design scenario, ‘Green parking lots and squares’, the optimization method did not add shrubs in areas with overarching trees, very nearby footpaths, or in tick host habitats. As a result, tick-bite risk did not increase. For street segments with a tick-bite risk larger than zero in the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario and with only publicly accessible UGS affecting footpaths, the risk was reduced to zero in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario. This was due to the fact that all shrubs and herbs were removed from these places and replaced by mown grass where possible.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nThis section discusses the major findings and their implications for urban greening strategy, as well as the limitations of this scenario study. We end with a conclusion on the key contributions of the study and the priorities for further research.\n4.1. Major Findings and Implications for Urban Greenspace Planning\nThe results of this scenario study of urban greening strategies can be summarized into four major findings with important implications for urban greenspace planning. First, when the health effects of UGS designs are assessed by the average indicator values of health determinants or when assessed by the frequencies of exceedance of pre-set thresholds, the outcomes may differ. As urban decision makers are most probably more concerned about the exceedance of thresholds than about average indicator values, this finding stresses the importance of translating general urban health policy objectives and priorities into specific threshold or target values and using these values when assessing the effectiveness of proposed greening strategies. Second, there is a real risk that a greening strategy not only results in greater health benefits of UGS but increases health burdens as well. This means that ‘more green’ is not always an improvement from a health perspective and that greening strategies should be carefully considered. This leads to the third major finding, which is that—within certain limits—‘location’ matters more than ‘area’ of UGS and that well-considered positioning of the various UGS types can reduce trade-offs between beneficial and detrimental effects of UGS. For urban greenspace planning, this implies that it is important to consider UGS location already in an early stage of urban development, as relocating well-developed trees and shrubs is costly and often not even feasible. The analysis of the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario suggests that a strong reduction in trade-offs between benefits and burdens can already be achieved with only a limited set of UGS design principles. Using statistical analyses of large datasets of greenspace morphology and disease prevalence, Wang and Tassinary [\n35\n] also concluded that the location, shape, and connectivity of urban greenspace have a significant effect on health above and beyond the sheer amount of greenspace. However, consideration of the underlying mechanisms, as in our model, is essential to inform context-specific greenspace design [\n36\n]. The fourth and final major finding concerns air pollution. The results show that UGS can have an overall detrimental or beneficial effect and that a current net burden can be changed into a net benefit by adding more UGS area or changing UGS location. However, the results also show that in both cases, the UGS contribution is relatively small, which means that urban spatial planners should realize that greenspace is unlikely to be a major solution to serious air pollution problems.\n4.2. Limitations\nThe approach followed in this assessment of alternative UGS designs has various limitations, which means that, in particular, the method to determine the optimal location of UGS cannot be implemented in practice without further consideration. First of all, other factors than health were not included in this method. An important factor to consider when choosing a UGS location is the cost of planting and maintenance. It might be much more expensive to keep vegetation alive at the ‘optimal’ location (e.g., due to watering requirements) or to prevent it from being a nuisance to the people living or working nearby (e.g., due to pruning requirements or the need to remove leaf litter). Additionally, the conservation of urban biodiversity or cultural heritage can be important factors to consider in UGS design, just as social factors (e.g., optimizing UGS to promote interaction between certain social groups). With respect to the latter, when health benefits are considered that involve the active use of urban greenspace by residents, such as ‘meeting’ or ‘physical activity’, we recommend combining an expert- or model-based assessment with a resident-based assessment of greenspace designs [\n37\n,\n38\n]. Such a participatory approach is recommended, in particular, when implementing a city-level greenspace strategy at the neighborhood level [\n16\n].\nAnother limitation of the approach is that there are other health benefits and burdens of UGS that have not been taken into account but that might change optimal locations. For example, trees (e.g., birches) also produce pollen, resulting in sometimes very serious hay fever symptoms. A related limitation is that the approach does consider the UGS type (trees, shrubs, etc.) but does not consider the choice of plant species. Tree species, however, can differ greatly in the production of allergenic pollen and their effect on air quality [\n39\n], as well as in their shading capacity [\n40\n].\nThe presented approach to assess urban greenspace strategies and designs at a city scale was applied to Maastricht but is, in principle, generic and not limited to this specific case. To run the spatial model underlying the approach, input datasets were used that are publicly available in high resolution. These input data are currently available country-wide for the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and the UK [\n17\n]. This means that the approach can be applied to any city in these countries. Moreover, the availability of this type of input data is rapidly increasing for many other countries as well, and hence, the application domain of the approach in terms of geographic coverage is large and growing. Finally, the model does not provide an estimate of the overall net health outcome of a given UGS design, which also limits its optimization capacity. A first step would be to include actual health outcomes, such as disease. Examples are the calculation of a reduction in cardiovascular diseases based on an estimated decrease in air pollution or an epidemiological exposure–response curve to link heat stress (PET) to mortality. Not only would this improvement result in indicators that are more tangible for local decision makers, spatial planners, and residents, but it would also be easier to perform a monetary valuation of the health benefits of greenspace, for example, in the form of avoided medical or sick leave costs. Integrating these actual health outcomes with a common metric would have even more advantages. Firstly, it would offer the ability to fully optimize greenspaces for human health. Secondly, the total health (outcome) burden, as well as the total UGS contribution to the total health burden, could be expressed in a single comparable figure for each design scenario. Modeling the actual health effects of UGS design in terms of disease burden, therefore, requires two additional model development steps: (1) translation of the current health determinant indicators into specific disease or disability indicators, for example, via quantitative epidemiological exposure–response models, and (2) translation of these disease or disability indicators into an aggregate health indicator or common metric.\n4.3. Conclusions\nUrban greening is a major goal in policies for sustainable cities, and we presented a novel approach to support the development of urban greening strategies aimed at promoting residents’ health. The approach involves a model-based assessment of the effectiveness of alternative city-scale UGS design scenarios that is integrated, quantitative, and spatially explicit and account for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. This generic approach was applied to a specific city (Maastricht) and led to clear conclusions about the health benefits and burdens of concrete UGS designs for this city, but it also generated novel, more general insights relevant to the planning of UGS for health. These insights concern the importance of translating health policy objectives into specific target values or thresholds and the importance of ‘smart’ choices in UGS locations that can effectively reduce trade-offs between the health benefits and burdens of urban greening, as well as the insights that adding more greenery not always improves urban health and that urban greenspace alone cannot solve major air pollution problems. Priorities for future research, addressing limitations of the current approach, concern the expansion of the range of health benefits and burdens of UGS covered by the model, and the development of a common metric for the entire range of health benefits and burdens, allowing the optimization of UGS design to maximize its overall net health benefit.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, B.O. and J.d.K.; methodology, B.O.; software, B.O.; formal analysis, B.O. and J.d.K.; writing—original draft preparation, B.O.; writing—review and editing, J.d.K.; visualization, B.O.; supervision, J.d.K., M.M.T.E.H. and P.M.; funding acquisition, P.M.

The code of this component was written in Python programming language (version 2.7.14python.org) because of its compatibility with the ArcGIS geo-information software that we used (version 10.8.1arcgis.com). See Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n] (2023) for a complete explanation of the geoprocessing model.\nFigure A1.\nOverview of GIS datasets and main GIS processes to create the computer-generated green space scenario.

        "abstract": "Urban Green Spaces (UGS) offer extensive benefits, yet their distribution reveals significant socioeconomic disparities. Despite the growing body of research, there is a gap in understanding the spatial equity of greenspace, especially in the Global South. This gap extends to the association between UGS and public health in the context of low-income countries. This study delves into the socioeconomic-green relationships within the Brazilian metropolitan areas’ context. The research comprised a survey of 2597 participants, assessing their sociodemographic profiles, accessibility and suitability of UGS, frequency and duration of visits to UGS, and the impact on their mental well-being (via DASS-21). Welch's ANOVA and Pearson's χ² tests revealed significant sociodemographic disparities in UGS accessibility and in well-being. Gender, age, and marital status were associated with mental health. The study found that proximity and suitability of UGS significantly impacted mental health, with well-maintained spaces linked to lower mental distress. No direct correlation was found between income levels and proximity to UGS, however, disparities in access to suitable green spaces were evident. Findings highlight the need for tailored urban planning and policies ensuring equitable access to quality UGS. Strategies should consider the characteristics of neighborhoods and involve community participation to address environmental justice effectively.",

Abstract Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords 1. Introduction 2. Material and method •\nSociodemographic Profiles: This section collected detailed information about the participants' gender, race, age, income, educational attainment, marital status, and type of residence. This data provides a robust demographic background for the study. •\nWell-being Assessment: Participants' mental health was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), a globally recognized tool (Bibi et al., 2020). Questions focused on participants' feelings and experiences over the past week, such as difficulties in calming down, feelings of agitation, and tendencies to overreact. •\nUser’s Perceptions: This section explored participants' perceptions regarding the accessibility and suitability of UGS for visitation, leisure, and recreational activities, in addition to querying the frequency and duration of UGS visits.

        "abstract": "Urban heat poses significant challenges to public health, as exposure to high temperatures is associated to heat stress, resulting in heat strain, sleep deprivation, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As the frequency of heat waves is increasing due to global warming, urban green spaces are often proposed as a nature-based solution to mitigate urban heat stress. This study investigated the impact of urban green space on perceived heat stress and sleep quality, using questionnaires and detailed land cover data. We surveyed 584 respondents during four heat and four control events in the summers of 2021 and 2022, assessing perceived heat stress, sleep quality, and mental health. Using structural equation models, this study analysed the influence of both tree cover and grass and shrub cover on perceived heat stress and sleep quality, while controlling for risk and vulnerability factors. The outcomes revealed that during heat events, enhanced tree cover was associated with reduced heat stress (B = -0.484, 95% CI [-0.693, -0.275], p = 0.001), while increased grass and shrub cover was associated with both reduced heat stress (B = -0.361 [-0.529, -0.193], p = 0.000) and improved sleep quality (B = -0. 241 [-0.399, -0.083], p = 0.003). Conversely, during control events, stress indicators were more strongly associated with individual vulnerability factors rather than surrounding green space. These results emphasize the importance of combining trees with lower vegetation in urban planning to mitigate heat-related stress and enhance sleep quality, thereby improving overall well-being during heat events.",

We extend their argument by distinguishing benefits from green and blue spaces, and the particularities of surfing, both as therapy and recreation. Personal Wellbeing Index scores reveal improved outcomes among Australian surfers, compared to the national population. These diverse well-being effects highlight the value of surfing as an ocean-based ecosystem service.\nArising from\nBuckley, R. C. & Cooper, M. A. Mental health contribution to economic value of surfing ecosystem services.\nnpj Ocean Sustainability\n2(1) (2023).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44183-023-00027-5\n‘Blue spaces’ are natural or built environments centered around water, such as oceans, lakes, canals, or rivers\n2\n. Over the last decade, ‘blue spaces’ research has grown exponentially, in part, as an evolution from an existing body of knowledge on ‘green spaces’\n3\n. Despite sharing similarities, and often overlapping geographically, blue and green spaces are different in many ways, including their potential to improve human health and well-being\n4\n. We commend Buckley and Cooper\n1\nfor bringing attention to the positive mental health outcomes derived from recreational surfing, which they calculated based on previous data associated with visits to national parks. Here, we would like to offer some reflections drawing from recent research highlighting the particularities of surfing and natural blue spaces, for their potential to enhance human well-being. As the UN 2021-2030 Oceans Decade unfolds, we concur with Buckley and Cooper\n1\non the need to consider recreational surfing as an important catalyst for sustainability and resilience among coastal communities across the world.\nThe importance of blue and green spaces for health and well-being\nThe importance of blue spaces to society is increasingly recognized by community members, urban planners, health practitioners, and scholars across the world\n2\n,\n5\n. Paradoxically, the accelerated drive to develop the ’blue economy’ often threatens the very targets it aims to safeguard: marine sustainability and human well-being\n6\n. Surfers have been found to play a unique role in human-ocean interactions for their impacts (positive and negative) on the environment\n7\n, as well as the derived benefits, including ocean literacy\n8\nand improved physical and mental health\n2\n. Previous works have calculated certain market and non-market values associated with ‘surfing ecosystems’, but to date, no study has systematically quantified the human health benefits derived from recreational surfing\n9\n. Buckley and Cooper\n1\nestimate the value of stress reduction from surfing to be US $5,000 per person, per year, resulting from enhanced workplace productivity and reduced use of mental healthcare resources. This work represents a novel advance in the field of surf research. However, the underlying assumptions are based on the authors’ previous work on visits to national parks, which are only an approximate estimate of the benefits of surfing\n10\n. While few studies have systematically assessed the health effects of blue spaces compared to green spaces\n4\n, we contend that surf-derived benefits are distinct from visits to national parks.\nContrasting with the widespread distinction between green and blue spaces in the literature\n11\n, surf-derived benefits are likely to be a combination of blue and green space effects, given that both spaces often converge in coastal settings. Besides wave-riding, enjoyment from surfing is typically influenced by land-based features of the surrounding surfing ecosystem\n7\n, with previous evidence pointing to surfers’ strong preferences for high-quality, pristine natural environments\n12\n. In addition to exposure to ‘green’ environments, blue spaces have been found to facilitate therapeutic outcomes for people suffering from an array of physical and mental health conditions, including children and youth in need of social and emotional support, youth with a physical disability, military service members, cancer survivors, and adults recovering from addiction\n2\n. Nichols\n13\ncoined the term ‘blue mind’, to refer to the positive neuropsychological changes associated with experiences in water.\nThe benefits of surfing as therapy and recreation\nBased in Australia, our work with children and adolescents\n14\nshows that surf therapy can support improvements in symptoms of mental ill-health, specifically, symptoms of depression, anxiety, peer relationship problems, and hyperactivity/inattention in the short term. Importantly, we found that surf therapy is both feasible and acceptable to youth and their families as a means for addressing mental health concerns\n14\nand managing chronic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis (CF)\n15\n. Our research found that, by providing exposure to moving salty water and physical exertion, surfing was beneficial to patients with CF\n15\n. Australian doctors reported that patients with CF who surf have better lung health, which led to positive flow-on effects on the physical and psychological well-being of both patients and their carers. Our observations also noted mental health and skill-based benefits for staff and volunteers facilitating the surf therapy programs, adding to recent evidence on the causal effects of volunteering on improved well-being\n16\n. We are now exploring the effects on the well-being of a family-based surf intervention for children and adolescents with other chronic health conditions, including type 1 diabetes, burn injuries, and arthritis\n17\n. Although surf-based therapies may only yield modest aggregate economic value at regional or national scales (due to small subsets of participating populations), the known benefits to patients and their families warrant careful consideration in cost-effectiveness evaluations of clinical therapies.\nOur previous work\n18\n,\n19\nhas also shown that blue spaces are an important setting for supporting children’s health, development, and environmental consciousness. Parents perceived the beach as promoting children’s physical activity, both in and around the water. Blue spaces were found to be a positive place for young children’s socio-emotional development, positively impacting mental health through restoration, a place to explore risk-taking and build resilience, as well as contributing to a sense of identity. Furthermore, we found participants perceived blue spaces as biodiverse, potentially prompting environmental awareness and pro-environmental behaviors, such as picking up litter.\nIn addition to surf-based therapy, our ongoing research aims to gain a systematic understanding of well-being benefits among the general surfing population. Between February and May 2023, we administered an online survey, yielding 569 valid responses from Australian surfers\n20\n. Our results indicate that over 75% of respondents agreed that surfing has a positive impact on their physical and mental health, as well as their ability to deal with stress and foster social relationships. Our survey also asked participants to rate their subjective well-being using the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), an average score across seven measures of individual satisfaction, on a 0–100 scale\n21\n. The PWI has been endorsed by the Australian Government, the WHO, and the OECD\n22\nand is the measure used by Buckley et al.\n10\nin their estimation of the economic value of improved mental health through visits to national parks. We found that surfers report significantly higher (\np\n< 0.0002) PWI scores (mean PWI = 77.6, s.d. = 13.2,\nn\n= 569) than the Australian general population\n23\n(mean PWI = 75.2, s.d. = 13.7,\nn\n= 1902) (Fig.\n1\n). The 2.3% difference in PWI between surfers and the general population is within the range reported by Buckley et al.\n10\nfor park visits (ΔPWI = 2.2–5.7%). The impact of sampling approaches and population characteristics would need to be further explored. Priorities for future research include quantifying well-being gains for Australian surfers in economic terms, following the method employed by Buckley et al.\n10\n.\nFig. 1: Personal well-being average scores (0–100) for individual satisfaction questions (left) and PWI by age (right), for the Australian national population and Australian surfers.\nSee details on methods and demographics on surfers’ data in Manero et al.\n20\n.\nFull size image\nWhilst only 7.4% of surfing respondents were aged 65+, their PWI scores exceeded the Australian national average, for the same age group, by 2.39 percentage points (Fig.\n1\n). This sustained positive outcome in later stages of life is consistent with evidence demonstrating the effects of vigorous exercise in reducing stress, pain, insomnia and depression\n24\n. A unique aspect of surfing compared to other physical activities is the ability to allow for continuous engagement in intense exercise in a relatively non-weight-bearing environment. Frank et al.\n25\nfound that when compared to an age-matched sample of physically active non-surfers, surfers aged 60 and over presented better muscular contraction stability and postural sway—two key indicators of quality of life as we age. Thus, it is likely that surfers benefit from the sport in a way that most visitors to national parks would not. Even in unconventional surf destinations, such as Jæren, Norway\n26\n, surfers have been found to experience heightened moods and reduced stress–possibly intensified as a result of cold water exposure\n27\n.\nLike other physical activities involving social interactions, surfing can contribute to greater self-confidence, improved resilience, and fewer depressive symptoms\n28\n. Social groups centered around surfing, such as boardriders clubs, community organizations (e.g., surfingmums.com), and environmental advocacy groups (e.g. surfrider.org) can foster mutual support among members and a sense of belonging. Social bonds initiated and strengthened through surfing communities\n28\nare different from what would be experienced through individual visits to national parks\n1\n. Despite surfing being an individual sport, our PWI results show that ‘community connectedness’ is the well-being measure where Australian surfers outperform the national average by the largest margin, i.e., 5.1 percentage points\n23\n(Fig.\n1\n).\nHealth risks, broader considerations, and future research directions\nWe also acknowledge that surfing can entail adverse personal and social outcomes. Because waves are a limited resource and non-excludable (anyone can try to gain access)\n29\n, there is often competition among surfers, resulting in contentious and stressful interactions in the avid pursuit of ‘catching waves’. Protectionist attitudes among local residents, especially in overcrowded surf destinations, have been found to trigger confrontations and even escalate to physical abuse\n30\n. Other factors, such as the risk of sun-induced skin damage, acute injury\n31\n, or shark attacks\n32\n, may impact surfers’ well-being in different ways to the experiences of visitors to national parks\n1\n.\nIdeally, future research to understand surf-derived well-being impacts would include physiological data, which can be used to systematically assess bio-physical health parameters, such as blood pressure, heart rates, and stress levels\n33\n. However, because in-nature activities contribute to human health in multiple ways\n11\n, it can be difficult to discern the specific effects of surfing from the benefits of general exposure to ocean-based environments. Artificial wave pools, where surfing waves are mechanically generated within a man-made environment, offer a promising setting for exploring the distinct effects of wave-riding, in the absence of influences from natural blue and green spaces\n34\n.\nIn summary, our exploration into the intersection of surfing, blue spaces, and human well-being highlights the distinct benefits derived from surfing, setting them apart from those associated with visits to national parks\n1\n. Differentiating factors include being in and around water, remarked improvements in child health, involvement in vigorous physical activity, and enhanced social interactions. In addition to the positives, it is crucial to acknowledge surfing’s potential stressors, such as overcrowding and safety concerns. We commend Buckley and Cooper\n1\nfor drawing attention to the positive mental health outcomes associated with recreational surfing. At the same time, we recommend that future research is based on surfer-specific data to uncover the unique aspects of surfing as a therapeutic and health-promoting activity. We expect this growing body of knowledge to contribute to the global recognition of surfing ecosystems as catalysts for greater sustainability and resilience for coastal communities worldwide.\nData availability\nData are provided in the supplementary information files.\nReferences\nBuckley, R.

Industrial development has accelerated China’s land use transformation, leading to a loss in urban green spaces (UGS) and their uneven distribution, thus exacerbating the health disparities between rural migrants and local dwellers. In 2016, the State Council issued the\nHealthy China 2030 Planning Guidelines\nto address health concerns and highlight the importance of optimizing the greenspace system for health promotion. Critically, the plan underscores the goals of ‘One Health’, aimed at improving health across all social groups. It focuses specifically on rural migrants, who are at risk for mental illness due to social exclusion induced by spatial and cultural displacement for large-scale migration [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Although previous research has thoroughly explored the health benefits of UGS in mainstream populations [\n4\n,\n5\n], few studies have been conducted on rural migrants. The ‘migrants status’ as a factor in Social Determinants of Health (SDH) indicates not only differences in social structure but also potential inequalities in access to favorable facilities [\n6\n]. This paper focuses on rural migrants in urban China, an environmentally vulnerable group [\n3\n], and examines their exposure to neighborhood greenspace in terms of both\nquality\nand\nquantity\n, as well as the mental health outcomes associated with this exposure, aiming to enrich the body of research on environmental justice within urban green spaces.\nUnpacking the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS: implications for migrant populations\nExposure to various attributes of greenspace has different implications for health outcomes. Scholars commonly examine their\nquality\nand\nquantity\ndimensions. The\nquality\nof UGS refers to elements that determine value and desirability, including aesthetic attractiveness, utility, and ecological diversity [\n7\n]. The\nquantity\nrefers to the amount or extent of greenery in a specific geographical location, covering indoor or outdoor greenery, wild nature, pocket parks, wetlands, and other features [\n8\n]. The conventional methodology for evaluating the\nquality\nof UGS involves questionnaires and field audits [\n4\n]. Such methods are, however, subject to some drawbacks, such as subjective responses and participants’ recall bias, as well as being time-consuming and resource-intensive, which makes them challenging to implement on a large scale. To quantify the UGS, researchers frequently use geospatial data, satellite imagery, and other related datasets. Yet, these methods are constrained to an overhead perspective when measuring greenery, to some extent ignoring the eye-level. As urban computational science develops, an increasing number of studies utilize street-view images to capture the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS. Consequently, integrating multisource data is becoming a prevalent approach in environmental research. This study aims to contribute to urban environmental research by incorporating traditional survey data, geospatial information, and urban management data to explore the health effects of UGS through a nuanced, multifaceted lens.\nMost previous research has concentrated on the UGS\nquantity\n, including street-view greenness, park density, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. Recent studies have examined\nquality\nfactors such as naturalness, colorfulness, and cleanliness, but evidence in this area remains limited [\n13\n]. Four European cities demonstrated significant links between mental health and qualitative and quantitative greenness indices like garden design, tree count, and blue space size [\n14\n]. Research on new housing development projects revealed no correlation between park density and psychological distress, yet distress declined in areas with high-quality, well-maintained parks [\n15\n]. These inconclusive findings suggest that green space has varying effects on mental health, influenced by its\nquality\nand\nquantity\n.\nIn China, research on UGS is mainly directed towards mainstream groups, with limited attention given to rural migrants [\n16\n]. This oversight fails to address the unique challenges migrants face in accessing greenspaces due to their socioeconomic disadvantages and housing constraints. The\nhukou\nsystem, China’s distinctive household registration framework, has historically institutionalized the rural-urban societal divide, restricting internal mobility and creating differential access to resources [\n17\n]. Consequently, rural migrants are more susceptible to physical deprivation than their local counterparts [\n2\n], stemming from their disadvantaged position in the local housing market and lack of social and financial support [\n18\n]. This disparity extends to UGS access, as evidenced by studies in major Chinese cities. Research in Wuhan revealed a negative correlation (coefficient − 2.79) between UGS accessibility and the proportion of migrants in neighborhoods [\n19\n]. Similarly, in Guangzhou, over half of the neighborhoods exhibited unequal access to UGS for migrants [\n20\n]. These environmental inequalities can exacerbate spatial polarization, potentially intensifying disparities between migrants and local residents [\n21\n]. Such social consequences may further deteriorate migrants’ mental health [\n22\n].\nOn the other hand, rural migrants’ persistent housing mobility frequently results in the unstable usage of UGS [\n23\n], potentially impacting their mental health [\n3\n]. This instability not only limits their physical activity and civic engagement [\n24\n], but also results in fleeting encounters between migrants and local residents [\n25\n]. These transient interactions hinder the development of social connections between the two groups, potentially eroding social cohesion and increasing mental health issues [\n26\n]. Given the social inequalities in UGS access and the insufficient usage by migrants due to their mobile nature, the\nquantity\nof UGS may play a more critical role in promoting health among rural migrants compared to local residents. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH1\nThe\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact the mental health of rural migrants. Of these two factors, the\nquantity\nexerts a more pronounced effect.\nExacerbating discrimination? The polarizing potential of green space in urban China\nWhile the social benefits of greenness are widely acknowledged [\n5\n,\n27\n], their potential to exacerbate socio-spatial issues (such as perceived discrimination and deriving exclusion), particularly for migrants, requires careful consideration. High-quality UGS can attract people to stay longer and engage in a range of spontaneous activities (e.g., walking) and optional activities (e.g., recreation), as well as social interactions [\n15\n,\n28\n]. Their health effects are determined by both their existence and the sociality it engenders [\n9\n,\n15\n,\n29\n]. Perceived discrimination, a formidable barrier to social integration, has sparked research interest in the social dynamics within UGS [\n5\n]. While studies from Ljubljana and Edinburgh suggested that suburban green spaces can reduce discrimination by encouraging citizen involvement [\n30\n], contrasting evidence reveals experiences of exclusion. For example, some Latino groups have reported feeling ‘out of place’, unwelcome, or marginalized when visiting parks [\n31\n].\nAs for China, housing market reforms have fueled socio-spatial stratification, exacerbating environmental injustice in urban areas [\n32\n], such as unequal access to UGS [\n33\n], which disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups such as migrants and low-income residents. Evidence from Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai repeatedly confirms this pattern: while the priority commonly enjoys high-quality gardens in their private communities [\n21\n], underprivileged individuals frequently fail to access similar amenities [\n34\n,\n35\n]. This disparity reinforces social polarization and perpetuates discrimination and exclusion through several spatial-social processes. A prime example is green privatization, often manifested in the proliferation of gated communities, which restricts public access to urban green spaces. This trend, often driven by market forces and neoliberal planning ideologies, results in a form of ‘green gentrification’ [\n36\n], where access to nature becomes a commodity reserved for the advantaged population. Physical barriers such as fences, walls, and strategically designed ‘soft’ landscaping elements serve to delineate social boundaries, control entry and exit of neighborhoods, and effectively limit opportunities for social interaction across socioeconomic/\nhukou\n-based lines [\n37\n]. This phenomenon is aptly illustrated in Wu et al.’s study of Beijing, which reveals how high-end gated communities create exclusionary enclaves with abundant green spaces, essentially privatizing what were once public amenities [\n21\n]. Beyond these physical barriers, hostile attitudes and discriminatory actions further restrict marginalized groups’ access to and enjoyment of green spaces. Activities perceived as disruptive and culturally discordant, associated with stigmatized status– such as square dancing in public parks–often provoke complaints and discriminatory responses [\n37\n,\n38\n]. These microaggressions, though seemingly subtle, contribute to a negative social climate for disadvantaged groups, discouraging their use of green spaces and furthering existing social exclusion. In more extreme cases, the stark reality of discrimination lies through veiled ways, such as warning signs, small advertisements, and strategically placed posters that implicitly or explicitly target specific racial groups or outsiders [\n39\n]. While these methods may not always constitute overt legal violations, they nonetheless contribute to a non-inclusive environment. This covert form of discrimination often operates through coded language, imagery, or spatial practices that reinforce existing social hierarchies and marginalize targeted neighborhoods. Such practices highlight the urgent need to address not only the physical but also the social consequences of UGS inequality.\nEven more problematic, the discrimination people experience in urban greenery isn’t localized; it impacts all walks of life [\n40\n,\n41\n]. For migrants, this effect is more inescapable, as their status often magnifies the social disparities in accessing UGS [\n42\n]. This increased vulnerability is not limited geographically and can have long-term consequences for health, well-being, and social mobility. For example, a study in Dongguan, China, utilizing semi-structured interviews with temporary migrant workers, found that while squares near factories provided space for congregation, socialization, and exercise, interactions remained largely segregated, with rural fellows sharing similar migration backgrounds and reporting minimal interaction with local residents [\n41\n]. Although participants recognized the health benefits of using the square, they also mentioned ongoing discrimination experiences permeating their daily urban lives. This aligns with Zhang’s (2022) argument that green spaces may become sites of social division [\n43\n]. Despite shared physical presence, diverse groups’ avoidance behaviors in these spaces can reinforce segregation and marginalization of immigrant minorities, extending beyond the public realm. These findings suggest that discrimination experiences, whether specific to green spaces or reflecting broader everyday realities, may significantly impact migrants’ mental health. However, further research is needed to explore more diverse narratives among rural migrants in urban China. Accordingly, our hypothesis is:\nH2\nUGS can indirectly affect the mental health of rural migrants through perceived everyday discrimination in urban China.\nThe Geo-Contextual determinants of health\nFurther, the relationships between UGS, the social mediator, and mental health may hold differences across rural-urban contexts [\n5\n,\n29\n,\n44\n]. These differences, on the one hand, are attributed to the unequal distribution of UGS between suburban and central areas. Evidence from European cities suggested that compared to urban areas, around 77% of the population residing in the rural-urban interface lacks adequate access to UGS [\n45\n], which could bring about health issues. In England, despite abundant greenery in suburban and rural areas, it neither influenced health outcomes nor showed differences between these two areas [\n29\n]. Nevertheless, this conclusion is not universally applicable. In some cases, socially and economically disadvantaged populations may have access to more greenery in less privileged areas than their counterparts. Residents living in affordable housing and urban villages in urban China—considered underprivileged groups—have access to higher vegetation coverage rates than other urban populations [\n46\n]. These findings suggest that the health effects of UGS may be context-dependent along the rural-urban gradient.\nOn the other hand, their contextual heterogeneity may also result in differing social implications [\n22\n]. For instance, Neier (2023) identified segregation-based environmental inequality in Vienna [\n47\n], while in Beijing, lower-income areas have significantly reduced access to UGS, exacerbating spatial polarization between the rich and poor [\n21\n]. Scholars contend that this unequal distribution of ‘environmental goods’ like UGS is not coincidental but a consequence of long-term discriminatory policies [\n48\n]. The environmental marginalization of migrants was caused by a lack of recognition of their civic rights and informal livelihood strategies [\n49\n]. Additionally, their limited political capital often prompts governments and developers to pursue a ‘path of least resistance’, minimizing expenditure on environmental improvements at the expense of vulnerable groups [\n50\n]. The social effects of greenness, interlinked with rural-urban contexts, collectively influence one’s mental health.\nThis study, therefore, examines the impact of UGS on rural migrants’ perceived everyday discrimination and mental health outcomes. It further elucidates the heterogeneity of urban environments through comparative analyses of inner-city and inner-suburban areas. Building on the literature reviewed above, we propose:\nH3\nThe direct and indirect health impacts of UGS differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburb, demonstrating the Geo-Contextualization of these effects.\nWe validate the three hypotheses above by utilizing multisource data, incorporating the social survey, geospatial information, and urban environmental management data collected in Wuhan (see Fig.\n1\n). Our findings underscore the necessity of inclusive planning, design, and management of UGS, advocating for a nuanced approach that accounts for the diverse attributes of greenness to which environmentally vulnerable groups are particularly sensitive.\nFig. 1\nResearch design diagram\nFull size image\nStudy design\nData sources\nWe chose Wuhan as the study area for three reasons. First, Wuhan is undergoing rapid urbanization, similar to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, and it is one of the major migrant-receiving cities in China. According to the seventh national population census in 2020, the number of migrants in Wuhan reached 7.02 million, accounting for 32% of the total population, higher than the percentage (19.79%) in 2000 from the fifth national population census [\n51\n]. Second, there is a considerable geographical disparity in the residential environments of rural migrants in Wuhan. Statistics show that 35.4% resided in old inner areas, 28.7% in urban-rural fringes, and 16.6% in urban villages and squatter settlements [\n52\n]. This environmental heterogeneity underscores the importance of examining health issues across different ecological contexts. Third, following the COVID-19 outbreak, building a healthy city has been a leading strategy for Wuhan’s development\nFootnote\n1\n. These features make Wuhan a typical case.\nThe spatial planning of Chinese cities follows a hierarchical structure: administrative districts, sub-districts (\nJiedao\ns), and neighborhoods. Our primary data comes from the ‘\nWuhan Neighborhood Environment and Migrants’ Quality of Life Survey\n’, conducted from September to November 2018. To sample participants, first, we selected ten\nJiedao\ns from seven inner-city and three inner-suburb districts. Second, we implemented a street-interception, face-to-face survey for each selected\nJiedao\nin specific neighborhoods. To ensure diverse representation among respondents, we administered the survey in the neighborhoods’ high-density areas frequented by a wide range of residents. These locations included entrances of grocery stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, parks, and areas adjacent to subway stations. Interviewers underwent specialized training to ensure consistent, unbiased respondent recruitment. The respondents were provided informed oral consent and received payment after the survey. The Ethics Committee of Wuhan University approved it. We cleaned the data by removing samples that completed the survey in an extremely short time or records with missing values, eventually obtaining 716 valid samples covering 60 neighborhoods. During the preliminary survey, we encountered several challenges specific to conducting door-to-door household surveys among migrant populations. These included the population’s high mobility, reluctance to participate due to defensive attitudes, incomplete registration information in neighborhood data, and our human and financial resources constraints. Consequently, we strategically adopted a street-intercept interview approach. To minimize selection bias, we carefully controlled age and gender balance during the survey, ensuring a sample that closely matched the demographics of the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) (Table\n1\n), strengthening the generalizability of our findings. The participants classified as rural migrants were selected based on the criteria that they were over 18 years old and had lived in Wuhan for at least six months without a Wuhan\nhukou\n, aligning with the definition of CMDS.\nApart from the survey data, we employed the following three datasets: (1) Parks’ social media rating data: we obtained it from the\nDianping\nplatform (\nhttps://www.dianping.com\n) tagged geo-location (one of the most informative life services and place rating websites in China) (LBSM)(August 2022); (2) Baidu Street view images (BSVs): we captured them from Baidu Maps (\nhttp://lbsyun.baidu.com/\n) (March 2021), the Chinese equivalent of Google Maps, which can offer diverse views and detailed information about the actual surroundings; (3) Neighborhood environment data: we obtained it from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center (October 2020). This dataset covers information on land use, land surface vegetation cover, buildings, road networks, etc.\nTo address the 0–3 year lag between health and environmental data collection (2019.1–2022.12), we analyzed UGS changes, finding minimal landscape alteration (Fig.\n2\n). While 28 new parks were added, none were within 800 m of sampled areas. Given this stability, and supported by existing research [\n8\n], we believe the time lag’s impact on health outcomes is negligible, maintaining the credibility of our conclusions for urban green space planning and public health policy.\nFig. 2\nChanges in UGS development within the sampled areas\nFull size image\nMeasures\nMental health\nMental health was measured by the established Chinese version [\n53\n] of the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [\n54\n]. Respondents rated the frequency of experiencing six positive (e.g., enjoying daily activities, feeling happy) (1 =\nnever\nto 5 =\nalways\n) and six negative (e.g., losing sleep due to anxiety, feeling nervous) emotions over the past 12 months. To minimize response bias, positive and negative items were clearly distinguished, and response scales were reversed for negative items (i.e., 5 =\nnever\nto 1 =\nalways\n). Moreover, to prevent individuals with severe mental illness from concealing or overestimating their mental health status, we emphasized the anonymity and confidentiality of responses throughout the survey. We calculated the final GHQ-12 score by summing all items, with higher scores indicating better mental health. This scale has demonstrated reliability in global public health research on migrant populations [\n3\n,\n55\n,\n56\n]. It has been instrumental in identifying individuals at risk of mental health difficulties and facilitating comparisons with other research.\nNeighborhood greenness exposure\nExisting literature proposes various frameworks for measuring greenness exposure, including both overhead-view and eye-level perspectives [\n28\n], as well as subjective and objective dimensions [\n3\n]. Given the Chinese government’s policy focus and ongoing scholarly debate on the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS for vulnerable groups, this study evaluates rural migrants’ greenness exposure along these two critical dimensions.\nThis study centered on four common aspects of the\nquality\nof UGS [\n9\n,\n57\n]: overall satisfaction, social media ratings, greenspace disorder, and the presence of recreational plaza-type parks. Specifically, the overall satisfaction with UGS was measured by a 5-point Likert scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 5 = totally satisfied) based on the question, ‘How satisfied are you with the quality of greenspace in your neighborhood?’. Additionally, to capture public perceptions of park quality, we incorporated user-generated social media ratings from the\nDianping\nwebsite. This platform features anonymous reviews of parks, incorporating aspects like cost, aesthetics, and activity offerings. We calculated a weighted average rating for each neighborhood based on the five nearest parks, employing an inverse distance weighting method, as showed in Equation.\nA1\n, Appendix. Parks were weighted at 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1 [\n58\n], respectively, according to their proximity (calculated using road network distances) to the neighborhood centroid. The farthest park analyzed was within a 4.17 km radius, accessible within 30–60 min by public transportation [\n59\n]. This accessibility criterion ensured all parks were reachable within a reasonable timeframe, justifying our decision to set the weight of the fifth park to 0.1 instead of 0. Drawing upon established audit tools [\n9\n,\n57\n], we quantified greenspace disorder using data on environmental enforcement actions related to UGS management. This dataset, provided by the Wuhan City Urban Management and Law Enforcement Commission, documented instances of littering, solid waste accumulation, and maintenance issues (e.g., bare vegetation, inadequate facilities, or lighting) in UGS within an 800 m radius of each neighborhood. A higher density of reported cases signifies greater disorder within the UGS. Recreational plaza-type parks were identified as a crucial indicator of UGS quality. Park boundaries were extracted from remote sensing imagery, the Gaode Map platform, and the Wuhan City Park Directory (see Fig.\nA1\n, Appendix). We classified parks based on the ‘Urban Green Area Classification Standard CJJ/T 85-2017’\nFootnote\n2\nreleased by China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. This variable was operationalized as a binary indicator (1 = presence, 0 = absence).\nTo measure the\nquantity\nof UGS, we employed three widely used metrics [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]: park density, park area ratio, and the Green View Index (GVI). These measures allow for meaningful comparisons with other studies and contexts. We calculated park density as the number of parks within an 800 m radius buffer around each neighborhood centroid. Park locations were extracted from points of interest (POIs) accessed through the Baidu Map API. The park area ratio, calculated as the proportion of land dedicated to parks, was derived using GIS data on land use classification obtained from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center. To quantify the visibility of greenery, we computed the GVI using Baidu Street View imagery [\n10\n]. Data collection points were established at 100-meter intervals along the road network within the 800 m buffer. At each point, we captured panoramic street-level images (500 × 500 pixels) in four cardinal directions (90°, 180°, 270°, 360°) using a Python script. We then employed a fully convolutional neural network (FCN-8s) for semantic segmentation, enabling the identification and extraction of green elements (e.g., trees, grass) within each image [\n10\n]. The GVI at each point was computed as the average proportion of green pixels across the four directional images. The neighborhood-level GVI was then determined by averaging the GVIs of all collection points within the corresponding buffer zone.\nPrior research has employed diverse definitions of ‘neighborhood,’ including Transportation Analysis Zones (\nTAZ\ns), zip codes, census tracts, blocks,\nJiedao\ns, and radial buffers ranging from 100 m to 2 km. Given the focus of this study on creating health-oriented neighborhoods, we defined ‘neighborhood’ using an 800 m radius buffer. This decision aligns with Wuhan’s ‘\nPlanning Action for 15-Minute Community Life Circle\n’ (2018), which designates a 500–800 m radius as the primary daily living space based on a 15-minute walking distance. This operationalization enhances the practical implications of our findings for urban planning and public health initiatives.\nPerceived everyday discrimination\nWe measured perceived everyday discrimination (PED) by adapting the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) [\n60\n]. This adapted scale, reflecting prevalent discrimination issues reported by Chinese migrants, comprises three items quantifying respondents’ experiences of being disliked, treated with contempt, and facing reluctance from the local population as neighbors. Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with higher summed scores indicating greater perceived discrimination. While this measure captures general daily discrimination rather than being green space-specific, we argue for its ecological validity as our study is situated within a broader investigation of neighborhood environments and migrant quality of life in Wuhan. Discrimination experienced by migrants permeates various aspects of daily life [\n40\n], including but not limited to UGS interactions operating within a broader social and spatial context. Literature also suggests that UGS-related discrimination often extends beyond geographical boundaries [\n2\n]. Examining everyday discrimination provides a more comprehensive lens for understanding environmental injustice experienced by migrants in urban settings.\nSociodemographic covariates\nWe included a set of individual characteristics as control variables [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n28\n], such as age, gender, and educational status (Table\n1\n). Personal annual income was also considered a dichotomy based on Wuhan’s per capita yearly income 2019\nFootnote\n3\n. A value of 1 (High) was assigned to the income above the average (≥ 50,000 CNY), while a value of 0 (Low) was given to the income below the average (<50,000 CNY). We grouped the residential location into inner-city (0) and inner-suburb (1).\nTable 1 Summary of variable statistics\nFull size table\nData analysis and modeling approach\nOur data analysis comprised three main steps. First, we performed descriptive analyses using\nChi\n-square and\nt\n-tests to examine statistical differences in UGS, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health across rural-urban contexts. Second, to address the hierarchical nature of our data (individuals nested within neighborhoods), we aggregated environmental data captured by each individual response to the neighborhood level. This aggregation was done by calculating the mean score for each environmental variable within each unique neighborhood identifier, effectively transitioning from individual-level to neighborhood-level data. Third, we applied Multilevel Structural Equation Models (MSEM) to test our hypotheses by examining the relationships between greenness exposure, the mediator, and mental health outcomes among rural migrants. We estimated the significance of each pathway, indirect effects, and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Multiple models were conducted to compute direct, indirect, and total effects within each pathway, considering different residential locations to understand their varying impacts in rural-urban contexts. The Variance Inflation Factor (\nVIF\n) for all variables averaged 1.4 (below the threshold of 5), suggesting the absence of severe multicollinearity. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16 [\n61\n], employing commands such as ‘ttest’, ‘gsem’, and ‘nlcom’.\nResults\nSample characteristics and contextual differences\nTable\n1\nprovides the descriptive statistics. The average score of the GHQ-12 was 46.42 (SD ± 5.03), close to the health score’s median value. 15.82% of the respondents reported having ‘always’ and ‘often’ lost much sleep due to over-anxiety and ‘feelings of nervousness,’ indicating that rural migrants in Wuhan generally experienced unsatisfactory mental health and some emotional distress. Additionally, groups residing in the inner-city exhibited more favorable mental health.\nFor the UGS\nquality\n, the average score of the general satisfaction and parks’ social media rating was 3.45 (SD ± 0.49) and 4.33 (SD ± 0.35), respectively. The average number of environmental management cases reported by residents was 2.86; over half of the neighborhoods (56.70%) had urban management problems with greening (with values exceeding 1). Only 30.59% had recreational plaza-type parks. For the\nquantity\n, the park density, park area ratio, and GVI averaged at 1.10 (SD ± 1.45), 0.09 (SD ± 0.16), and 0.28 (SD ± 0.07), respectively.\nTable\n2\nillustrates the disparities in UGS characteristics across rural-urban contexts. Inner-city neighborhoods, where migrant workers reside, exhibited higher park density (by 1.12 units) and park area ratio (by 0.06) compared to inner-suburban areas. Conversely, the inner-suburb demonstrated a significantly higher green view index (by 0.05 units). Qualitatively, inner-city respondents reported greater perceived greenery satisfaction (by 0.38) and higher park social media ratings (by 0.23). However, these areas also faced more greenspace disorder issues, with environmental management cases exceeding those in inner-suburban areas by 1.01. Inner-suburban areas, in contrast, featured a higher proportion of recreational plaza-type parks. These findings reveal unequal access to UGS among migrant populations across the rural-urban continuum.\nAdditionally, rural migrants experience a moderate everyday discrimination from local residents, with an average score of 6.40 (SD ± 1.90) out of 15. While the difference isn’t statistically significant, the data indicates a potential trend where migrants in inner-suburban areas may face slightly higher levels of discrimination than those in inner-city areas. This marginal difference of 0.21 could be explored further in future research to determine its significance and potential underlying factors.\nTable 2 Greeness exposure, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health: rural-urban context differences\nFull size table\nModel parameter estimates\nWe ran the model of the direct health effects of UGS, accounting for covariates. Subsequently, the model was re-estimated to include the discrimination factor as a mediator. Model fit was evaluated by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (\nAIC\n) and Bayesian Information Criterion (\nBIC\n) across the two models [\n62\n], with lower values indicating better model fit. As shown in Table\n3\n, across both the overall sample and the subsamples categorized by residential location, models incorporating perceived discrimination (Models 2, 4, 6) exhibited lower\nAIC\nand\nBIC\nvalues compared to those without (Models 1, 3, 5), suggesting its potential role as a social mediator in these associations.\nTable 3 Model fitting parameters\nFull size table\nModeling results: associations between UGS, discrimination, and mental health\nTable\n4\npresents the detailed modeling results, illustrating the direct, indirect, and total effects. As hypothesized (\nH1\n) and evidenced by the model, the\nquantity\nof UGS demonstrates a more decisive influence on the mental health of rural migrants in Wuhan compared to\nquality\naspects, partially contradicting previous studies on the general population [\n14\n,\n15\n]. However, these effects differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburban areas (Tables\nA1\nand\nA2\n, see Appendix), highlighting the importance of considering the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS concerning the Geo-Contextualization of health effects.\nSpecifically, high park density was significantly and positively correlated with mental health among rural migrants overall (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.119,\np\n< 0.05), with a stronger effect in the inner-city area (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.412,\np\n< 0.01, Appendix, Table\nA1\n). Additionally, each percentage point increase in GVI was associated with a 8.45-point rise in mental health scores, a benefit particularly evident in suburban areas. However, the relationship between\nquantity\nand mental health is not always straightforward. Unexpectedly, a larger park area ratio is associated with poorer mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= -3.611,\np\n< 0.1), especially for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -7.568,\np\n< 0.05, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding challenges previous studies [\n4\n,\n7\n] and suggests that simply increasing park size may not necessarily translate into better health, particularly in areas already abundant in greenness.\nDespite the dominant influence of\nquantity\n,\nqualitative\naspects of UGS also demonstrate significant, albeit context-dependent, associations with mental health. Social media ratings of parks show a significant, positive association with mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= 2.142,\np\n< 0.01), but only in inner-suburban neighborhoods (\nβ\ndirect\n= 6.019,\np\n-value = 0.015, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding suggests that living near highly-rated parks, especially those praised for their scenery, aesthetics, and overall attractiveness, may significantly improve mental health for inner-suburban migrants. Interestingly, perceived greenery satisfaction holds a nanced relationship. While generally positive, this relationship becomes significantly negative within the inner-city (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.137,\np\n-value = 0.056). This could be attributed to the confounding influence of housing market dynamics, where high greenspace satisfaction often coincides with elevated property values, potentially offsetting the mental health benefits [\n63\n]. Furthermore, the mental health benefits of recreational plaza-type parks appear to be context-dependent, specifically benefiting inner-city migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= 0.996,\np\n< 0.1) while not showing the same effect, and potentially even a slightly negative (although statistically insignificant) one, for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.253,\np\n> 0.1).\nTable 4 Results of MSEM in direct, indirect, and total effects\nFull size table\nFurthermore, our findings confirm\nH2\nand\nH3\nabout the role of perceived everyday discrimination in the relationship between UGS and mental health, and reveal critical differences between urban and suburban areas. In suburban areas, urban greenery more directly benefits mental health. However, in inner-city areas, the experience of discrimination plays a crucial mediating role. Specifically, for inner-city migrants, living near parks with recreational plazas is linked to better mental health, partly because it reduces experiences of discrimination (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.332, 95% CI: 0.060 to 0.605, Appendix Table\nA1\n). This contrasts sharply with rural migrants, especially those in inner-suburban areas, who showed a strong negative correlation between perceived discrimination and mental health (Fig. 3). While some trends suggested that greenspaces with favorable social media ratings (suburban) and satisfaction (inner-city) might also reduce discriminatory experiences (Fig.\n3\n), these did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, while access to high-quality UGS may lessen the negative mental health impacts of discrimination, particularly for inner-city migrants, this effect is not consistently observed across all rural-urban settings.\nWhile UGS\nquality\ngenerally produces the positive social outcomes, the relationship between their\nquantity\nand social dynamics is more nuanced. The social functions of UGS, such as reducing discrimination, appear to reverse under certain quantitative conditions. A high proportion of greenness, particularly in the inner-city (\nβ\nindirect\n= -0.965, 95% CI: -1.843 to -0.087, Appendix Table\nA1\n), was associated with increased perceived discrimination and consequently poorer mental health. This phenomenon may be attributed to these areas primarily serving as city-level parks [\n59\n], where proximate neighborhoods have experienced social segregation related to household registration or income, thereby amplifying discrimination and adversely impacting rural migrants’ mental health. Conversely, higher park density was linked to lower perceived discrimination and improved mental health (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.078, 95% CI: -0.084 to 0.239, Table\n4\n), suggesting that accessible UGS can facilitate social integration.\nUltimately, this study highlights the health influence of both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of UGS and differs across specific urban-rural contexts. In inner-suburban areas, proximity to moderately sized parks but high social media ratings and visibility significantly contributes to positive mental health outcomes for migrants. Conversely, in inner-city areas, high park density and recreational plaza-type parks prove more beneficial. Perceived discrimination emerges as a critical psychosocial mechanism. Neighborhood parks designed as recreational squares can indirectly promote mental health by mitigating perceived discrimination. However, a high proportion of UGS in an area may inadvertently exacerbate social segregation, negatively impacting mental health. These findings emphasize that the effective green spaces planning must consider their both\nquality\nand\nquantity\nacross different urban zones to maximize health benefits for rural migrants.\nFig. 3\nSignificant pathways across rural-urban contexts. *\np\n< 0.1; **\np\n< 0.05; ***\np\n< 0.01\nFull size image\nDiscussions\nUnder the ‘mobility turn’ in environmental health studies, the importance of neighborhood greenness exposure for rural migrants’ mental health has received growing attention. Taking Wuhan as a typical case, our study reveals that both the\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact migrants’ mental health, with\nquantity\ndemonstrating a stronger correlation. This contrasts with findings from low-density cities, such as those in the Netherlands [\n9\n] and Australia [\n15\n], where the\nquality\nhas been strongly influenced. The inconclusive results can be attributed to the city-specific urban form and the progress made in greening. The high-density built environment, fragmented spatial layout resulting from the presence of rivers and lakes, and transportation challenges inherent to Wuhan exemplify how these factors can exacerbate unequal access to UGS. These findings underscore the urgency for Wuhan to prioritize equitable green space development.\nA focus on detailed information revealed that only the social media ratings of parks exerted a positive influence. Unexpectedly, a higher proportion of park area was linked to poorer mental health. This finding corroborates extant literature suggesting a non-linear correlation between UGS and psychological well-being, aligning with the hypothesized ‘Greenery Saturation Effect’. The theory suggests that surpassing an optimal UGS exposure threshold may elicit adverse emotional responses [\n64\n]. Various studies provide evidence for this effect. For instance, Australian children’s happiness peaked with 21–40% green space coverage [\n65\n], while older adults’ overall health was optimal at an NDVI of 0.4 [\n66\n]. Exceeding these levels may yield diminishing returns or even detrimental effects on mental health. Several factors could explain this counterintuitive relationship. Larger parks often struggle with adequate security and lighting, potentially increasing crime risk and residents’ fear and stress [\n67\n]. For migrants in particular, extensive parklands may paradoxically restrict their opportunities for interaction with local residents, thus contributing to social isolation and negatively impacting mental health. Moreover, as illustrated by our fieldwork (Fig.\n4\n), prioritizing UGS for vulnerable groups concentrated in urban villages and affordable housing can strain municipal budgets. This financial burden often results in inadequate maintenance, reduced amenities, and diminished UGS quality, thereby undermining the intended health benefits. In conclusion, while green spaces generally support mental health, their effectiveness depends on factors beyond mere\nquantity\n, including\nquality\nand social considerations.\nFig. 4\nObservations of UGS conditions in migrant settlements (July 2021) By author.\nNote\nurban villages in the inner-city (Left) and affordable housing neighborhoods in the inner-suburb (Right)\nFull size image\nWe also observe the health effects of UGS differing along the rural-urban gradient. In inner-city areas, a higher density of parks directly promotes migrants’ mental health. Conversely, in suburban areas, the quality of parks, as indicated by social media ratings, has a more significant positive impact. This disparity can be attributed to Wuhan’s uneven distribution of ecological resources, particularly its circular arrangement of larger, more ecological suburban parks, contributes to this disparity\nFootnote\n4\n. While expansive, these parks face management and social functionality challenges. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between suburban migrants’ mental health and park area proportion, potentially due to increased exposure to fragmented greenness. Limited mobility in transit deserts may further exacerbate this issue [\n68\n]. These differing inner-city and suburban outcomes highlight divergent social processes. Inner-city green spaces can mitigate the mental health impacts of daily discrimination, an effect absent in suburban settings. This discrepancy likely stems from two interconnected factors related to Wuhan’s suburban environment: its rural-like nature, which can exacerbate migrants’ social withdrawal [\n41\n], and its highly segregated socio-spatial structure [\n69\n]. Both contribute to migrants interacting almost exclusively within their own identity group, thus impairing their sense of place and belonging. Consequently, suburban green spaces, despite their potential, minimally buffer the mental health impacts of discrimination among migrants compared to inner-city counterparts.\nThis study offers threefold contributions to the understanding of the health effects of UGS on the migrant population: (1) Geo-Contextualization of health effects: We demonstrate that the mental health outcomes of rural-to-urban migrants in urban China are significantly influenced by their residential location (inner-city vs. inner-suburb), highlighting the context-dependent nature of individual outcomes. (2) Nuanced green space impacts: While affirming the general health benefits of UGS for rural migrants, an overabundance of greenery, particularly in suburban areas, can be detrimental. Urban planning must balance UGS\nquality\nand\nquantity\n. (3) Contextual moderation of discrimination: We uncover spatially heterogeneous effects, with social mechanisms, such as reduced perceived everyday discrimination, driving the health benefits of UGS in inner-city areas. Conversely, in inner-suburban areas, these benefits manifest more directly, reflecting the influence of localized landscape characteristics and population distribution. This research builds upon and refines existing studies on the diverse health impacts of UGS across rural-urban gradients, emphasizing the need for context-specific urban planning interventions.\nDespite the study’s contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, while widely used, self-reported measures like the GHQ-12 are susceptible to response bias. Future research would benefit from incorporating additional mental health instruments, such as the GAD-7 and PSS, for cross-validation and exploring migrant-specific mental health concerns. Secondly, although socioeconomic variables were controlled for, the potential impact of mobility experience on rural migrants’ mental health warrants further investigation. Finally, due to data limitations restricting analysis to UGS presence, this study may underestimate migrants’ frequency and duration of UGS use. Future studies should collect detailed usage information to better understand its relationship with mental health, considering both availability and actual utilization.\nThese findings have several policy implications for developing healthy and inclusive cities. Firstly, while increasing urban green space is generally beneficial, a nuanced approach to balancing quantity with strategic quality enhancements is crucial. Policies should prioritize optimizing park density, visibility, and social value to cultivate positive public perception, particularly for environmentally disadvantaged populations. Secondly, designing inclusive and social green spaces is essential to mitigate potential discriminatory practices. This involves prioritizing human-scale designs that promote interaction and discourage territorial behavior. Additionally, government and community-led programming can foster social cohesion and intercultural exchange, cultivating a sense of belonging among migrants. Lastly, embracing context-specific design is vital. Inner-city interventions should focus on increasing park density through pocket parks and recreational plazas, while suburban strategies should enhance the social functionality of existing green spaces through improved amenities and engaging activities. By tailoring green space design to specific user groups and settings, cities can maximize the positive impact of these spaces on community well-being and social integration.\nData availability\nThe data is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions.

        "abstract": "The provision and management of urban green infrastructure (UGI) provides multiple benefits to the wellbeing of urban residents. A crucial, yet underexplored benefit, is the role that UGI can play in poverty alleviation. Acknowledging this role raises questions as to how UGI design and management can better provide opportunities for poverty alleviation and how it varies across UGI types and contexts. We consider this, using South Africa as an example, for five dimensions of poverty alleviation, namely (i) contributions to cash or non-cash income; (ii) increased opportunities for skills development and learning; (iii) improved physical and mental health; (iv) lessening of vulnerability and risk, and (v) increased opportunities to participate in decision-making. We do this for six types of UGI (amenity spaces, blue infrastructure, natural/semi-natural lands, urban parks, urban agriculture, and verges). We collectively ranked the current and future potential for poverty alleviation and the extent of change required to achieve the ranked potential for each UGI type. Urban agriculture was scored as having the highest current potential to contribute to poverty alleviation, and verges the least. In contrast, the ranking indicates that adopting pro-poor designs and principles will have the greatest returns per effort in parks and amenity spaces. But the widespread distribution and large extent of verges make them key areas for pro-poor interventions. Overall, we found that greater investment and changes in attitudes of authorities would have the greatest impact in poverty alleviation in all types of UGI, rather than policy and procedures around UGI design and management. We conclude that although the various types of UGI have markedly different potentials to contribute to poverty alleviation, there are some overarching strategies that planners and managers could adopt to promote poverty alleviation through UGI design and management.",

Summary of the approach used to determine the potential for poverty alleviation through pro-poor design and management of UGI and the relative ease with which it might be achieved. Table 1. Types of UGI used to assess their potential to contribute to poverty alleviation (adapted from Jones et al., 2022). UGI type Brief description Natural & semi-natural spaces Typically, large (but not always so) green areas dominated by natural or semi-natural vegetation, with relatively low levels of transformation and relatively extensive (as opposed to intensive) management (e.g. forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, abandoned or ruderal areas, as well as those with limited vegetation such as sand dunes and rocky areas Parks & public gardens Multifunctional green spaces of varying sizes, ranging from pocket parks to large botanical, historical and recreational gardens Amenity spaces Public institutional green spaces designed or managed with an overriding key purpose, for example, sports fields/grounds, playgrounds, clinic and school gardens, cemeteries Verges Continuous or discontinuous strips of vegetation, hedges or trees along roads, streets, pathways, trails, railways, canals, waterways, streams Urban agriculture Public, collective or individually managed land parcels to provide regularly harvested products (e.g. crops, flowers, fruits, timber, biofuels, animals) for home use or sale Blue infrastructure Permanently or seasonally inundated water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, estuaries, oceans, dams, wetlands, bogs, fens, canals, bioswales 3.

        "abstract": "Recognition of the health benefits of nature contact has increased. Simultaneously, growing numbers of people worldwide experience loneliness. There is a movement towards prescribing nature-based activities to improve/promote social connections, health, and quality of life. Yet, what constitutes a therapeutic nature dose is not well understood, due in part, to the lack of instruments that capture the characteristics of nature-based activities and measure ‘nature dose.’ We created a nature dose measurement tool to fill this gap by capturing various aspects of contact with nature and perceptions regarding park access, quality, naturalness, psychological distance to nature, and biodiversity. This tool will facilitate greater understanding of how natural areas, nature-based activities, and nature exposure reduce loneliness and promote health-related quality of life. Measuring nature dose with standardized tools and documenting benefits will generate the evidence base needed to design, implement and evaluate nature-based social interventions for improving health and quality of life. • This tool captures the nature dose to reduce loneliness and promote quality of life. • Constructs range from park quality and access, to mood, to biodiversity perceptions. • The standardized nature dose tool will help design nature-based social interventions.",

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches.

Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"The Sustainable City: The Characteristic Public Urban Green Space for Enhancing Community Social Sustainability in Baghdad\" is highly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. The authors explore various characteristics of urban green spaces, particularly in the context of Baghdad, and delineate their role in boosting community social sustainability. This indicates that urban green spaces are not only places for recreation but also critical elements that contribute to the social fabric and overall well-being of communities.\n\nIn the paper, the authors employ a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. Surveys and interviews with local residents were utilized to gather data on their perceptions of urban green spaces and their impacts on social interaction. The survey methodology involved structured questionnaires that measured community engagement, sense of belonging, and physical health indicators associated with green space usage, thus ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the green spaces' effects.\n\nThe quality of evidence presented in this paper is commendable as it is grounded in empirical research conducted in a specific urban context. The findings are supported by statistical analysis of the survey data, demonstrating that residents who utilize urban green spaces report higher levels of community engagement and improved psychological well-being. Furthermore, the inclusion of direct quotes from the participants lends authenticity and depth to the findings, reinforcing the assertion that green spaces serve as vital hubs for social interaction, which is essential for community cohesiveness.\n\nOne of the significant findings highlighted in the study is the transformative role of urban green spaces in mitigating social isolation. The authors assert that these spaces foster interpersonal relationships among park users and act as venues for community activities, leading to a greater sense of community identity and belonging, ultimately promoting mental health and emotional resilience. This empirical evidence validates the claim that urban green spaces are integral to enhancing community well-being.\n\nHowever, the paper also admits certain limitations. The study is geographically confined to Baghdad, which may hinder the generalization of the results to other urban areas with different cultural and social dynamics. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data for assessing the subjective well-being of residents could introduce various biases, including social desirability bias, where individuals might portray an overly positive view of their experiences in green spaces to conform to societal expectations. Thus, while the findings are insightful, caution must be taken when applying these conclusions universally across diverse urban settings.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper underlines the multifaceted benefits of urban green spaces in enhancing community well-being, providing valuable insights into their role in fostering social sustainability. The quality of the evidence is strong due to the mixed-methods approach, but limitations related to geographical specificity and potential biases in self-reported data must be acknowledged when interpreting the findings.",

Industrial development has accelerated China’s land use transformation, leading to a loss in urban green spaces (UGS) and their uneven distribution, thus exacerbating the health disparities between rural migrants and local dwellers. In 2016, the State Council issued the\nHealthy China 2030 Planning Guidelines\nto address health concerns and highlight the importance of optimizing the greenspace system for health promotion. Critically, the plan underscores the goals of ‘One Health’, aimed at improving health across all social groups. It focuses specifically on rural migrants, who are at risk for mental illness due to social exclusion induced by spatial and cultural displacement for large-scale migration [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Although previous research has thoroughly explored the health benefits of UGS in mainstream populations [\n4\n,\n5\n], few studies have been conducted on rural migrants. The ‘migrants status’ as a factor in Social Determinants of Health (SDH) indicates not only differences in social structure but also potential inequalities in access to favorable facilities [\n6\n]. This paper focuses on rural migrants in urban China, an environmentally vulnerable group [\n3\n], and examines their exposure to neighborhood greenspace in terms of both\nquality\nand\nquantity\n, as well as the mental health outcomes associated with this exposure, aiming to enrich the body of research on environmental justice within urban green spaces.\nUnpacking the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS: implications for migrant populations\nExposure to various attributes of greenspace has different implications for health outcomes. Scholars commonly examine their\nquality\nand\nquantity\ndimensions. The\nquality\nof UGS refers to elements that determine value and desirability, including aesthetic attractiveness, utility, and ecological diversity [\n7\n]. The\nquantity\nrefers to the amount or extent of greenery in a specific geographical location, covering indoor or outdoor greenery, wild nature, pocket parks, wetlands, and other features [\n8\n]. The conventional methodology for evaluating the\nquality\nof UGS involves questionnaires and field audits [\n4\n]. Such methods are, however, subject to some drawbacks, such as subjective responses and participants’ recall bias, as well as being time-consuming and resource-intensive, which makes them challenging to implement on a large scale. To quantify the UGS, researchers frequently use geospatial data, satellite imagery, and other related datasets. Yet, these methods are constrained to an overhead perspective when measuring greenery, to some extent ignoring the eye-level. As urban computational science develops, an increasing number of studies utilize street-view images to capture the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS. Consequently, integrating multisource data is becoming a prevalent approach in environmental research. This study aims to contribute to urban environmental research by incorporating traditional survey data, geospatial information, and urban management data to explore the health effects of UGS through a nuanced, multifaceted lens.\nMost previous research has concentrated on the UGS\nquantity\n, including street-view greenness, park density, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. Recent studies have examined\nquality\nfactors such as naturalness, colorfulness, and cleanliness, but evidence in this area remains limited [\n13\n]. Four European cities demonstrated significant links between mental health and qualitative and quantitative greenness indices like garden design, tree count, and blue space size [\n14\n]. Research on new housing development projects revealed no correlation between park density and psychological distress, yet distress declined in areas with high-quality, well-maintained parks [\n15\n]. These inconclusive findings suggest that green space has varying effects on mental health, influenced by its\nquality\nand\nquantity\n.\nIn China, research on UGS is mainly directed towards mainstream groups, with limited attention given to rural migrants [\n16\n]. This oversight fails to address the unique challenges migrants face in accessing greenspaces due to their socioeconomic disadvantages and housing constraints. The\nhukou\nsystem, China’s distinctive household registration framework, has historically institutionalized the rural-urban societal divide, restricting internal mobility and creating differential access to resources [\n17\n]. Consequently, rural migrants are more susceptible to physical deprivation than their local counterparts [\n2\n], stemming from their disadvantaged position in the local housing market and lack of social and financial support [\n18\n]. This disparity extends to UGS access, as evidenced by studies in major Chinese cities. Research in Wuhan revealed a negative correlation (coefficient − 2.79) between UGS accessibility and the proportion of migrants in neighborhoods [\n19\n]. Similarly, in Guangzhou, over half of the neighborhoods exhibited unequal access to UGS for migrants [\n20\n]. These environmental inequalities can exacerbate spatial polarization, potentially intensifying disparities between migrants and local residents [\n21\n]. Such social consequences may further deteriorate migrants’ mental health [\n22\n].\nOn the other hand, rural migrants’ persistent housing mobility frequently results in the unstable usage of UGS [\n23\n], potentially impacting their mental health [\n3\n]. This instability not only limits their physical activity and civic engagement [\n24\n], but also results in fleeting encounters between migrants and local residents [\n25\n]. These transient interactions hinder the development of social connections between the two groups, potentially eroding social cohesion and increasing mental health issues [\n26\n]. Given the social inequalities in UGS access and the insufficient usage by migrants due to their mobile nature, the\nquantity\nof UGS may play a more critical role in promoting health among rural migrants compared to local residents. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH1\nThe\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact the mental health of rural migrants. Of these two factors, the\nquantity\nexerts a more pronounced effect.\nExacerbating discrimination? The polarizing potential of green space in urban China\nWhile the social benefits of greenness are widely acknowledged [\n5\n,\n27\n], their potential to exacerbate socio-spatial issues (such as perceived discrimination and deriving exclusion), particularly for migrants, requires careful consideration. High-quality UGS can attract people to stay longer and engage in a range of spontaneous activities (e.g., walking) and optional activities (e.g., recreation), as well as social interactions [\n15\n,\n28\n]. Their health effects are determined by both their existence and the sociality it engenders [\n9\n,\n15\n,\n29\n]. Perceived discrimination, a formidable barrier to social integration, has sparked research interest in the social dynamics within UGS [\n5\n]. While studies from Ljubljana and Edinburgh suggested that suburban green spaces can reduce discrimination by encouraging citizen involvement [\n30\n], contrasting evidence reveals experiences of exclusion. For example, some Latino groups have reported feeling ‘out of place’, unwelcome, or marginalized when visiting parks [\n31\n].\nAs for China, housing market reforms have fueled socio-spatial stratification, exacerbating environmental injustice in urban areas [\n32\n], such as unequal access to UGS [\n33\n], which disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups such as migrants and low-income residents. Evidence from Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai repeatedly confirms this pattern: while the priority commonly enjoys high-quality gardens in their private communities [\n21\n], underprivileged individuals frequently fail to access similar amenities [\n34\n,\n35\n]. This disparity reinforces social polarization and perpetuates discrimination and exclusion through several spatial-social processes. A prime example is green privatization, often manifested in the proliferation of gated communities, which restricts public access to urban green spaces. This trend, often driven by market forces and neoliberal planning ideologies, results in a form of ‘green gentrification’ [\n36\n], where access to nature becomes a commodity reserved for the advantaged population. Physical barriers such as fences, walls, and strategically designed ‘soft’ landscaping elements serve to delineate social boundaries, control entry and exit of neighborhoods, and effectively limit opportunities for social interaction across socioeconomic/\nhukou\n-based lines [\n37\n]. This phenomenon is aptly illustrated in Wu et al.’s study of Beijing, which reveals how high-end gated communities create exclusionary enclaves with abundant green spaces, essentially privatizing what were once public amenities [\n21\n]. Beyond these physical barriers, hostile attitudes and discriminatory actions further restrict marginalized groups’ access to and enjoyment of green spaces. Activities perceived as disruptive and culturally discordant, associated with stigmatized status– such as square dancing in public parks–often provoke complaints and discriminatory responses [\n37\n,\n38\n]. These microaggressions, though seemingly subtle, contribute to a negative social climate for disadvantaged groups, discouraging their use of green spaces and furthering existing social exclusion. In more extreme cases, the stark reality of discrimination lies through veiled ways, such as warning signs, small advertisements, and strategically placed posters that implicitly or explicitly target specific racial groups or outsiders [\n39\n]. While these methods may not always constitute overt legal violations, they nonetheless contribute to a non-inclusive environment. This covert form of discrimination often operates through coded language, imagery, or spatial practices that reinforce existing social hierarchies and marginalize targeted neighborhoods. Such practices highlight the urgent need to address not only the physical but also the social consequences of UGS inequality.\nEven more problematic, the discrimination people experience in urban greenery isn’t localized; it impacts all walks of life [\n40\n,\n41\n]. For migrants, this effect is more inescapable, as their status often magnifies the social disparities in accessing UGS [\n42\n]. This increased vulnerability is not limited geographically and can have long-term consequences for health, well-being, and social mobility. For example, a study in Dongguan, China, utilizing semi-structured interviews with temporary migrant workers, found that while squares near factories provided space for congregation, socialization, and exercise, interactions remained largely segregated, with rural fellows sharing similar migration backgrounds and reporting minimal interaction with local residents [\n41\n]. Although participants recognized the health benefits of using the square, they also mentioned ongoing discrimination experiences permeating their daily urban lives. This aligns with Zhang’s (2022) argument that green spaces may become sites of social division [\n43\n]. Despite shared physical presence, diverse groups’ avoidance behaviors in these spaces can reinforce segregation and marginalization of immigrant minorities, extending beyond the public realm. These findings suggest that discrimination experiences, whether specific to green spaces or reflecting broader everyday realities, may significantly impact migrants’ mental health. However, further research is needed to explore more diverse narratives among rural migrants in urban China. Accordingly, our hypothesis is:\nH2\nUGS can indirectly affect the mental health of rural migrants through perceived everyday discrimination in urban China.\nThe Geo-Contextual determinants of health\nFurther, the relationships between UGS, the social mediator, and mental health may hold differences across rural-urban contexts [\n5\n,\n29\n,\n44\n]. These differences, on the one hand, are attributed to the unequal distribution of UGS between suburban and central areas. Evidence from European cities suggested that compared to urban areas, around 77% of the population residing in the rural-urban interface lacks adequate access to UGS [\n45\n], which could bring about health issues. In England, despite abundant greenery in suburban and rural areas, it neither influenced health outcomes nor showed differences between these two areas [\n29\n]. Nevertheless, this conclusion is not universally applicable. In some cases, socially and economically disadvantaged populations may have access to more greenery in less privileged areas than their counterparts. Residents living in affordable housing and urban villages in urban China—considered underprivileged groups—have access to higher vegetation coverage rates than other urban populations [\n46\n]. These findings suggest that the health effects of UGS may be context-dependent along the rural-urban gradient.\nOn the other hand, their contextual heterogeneity may also result in differing social implications [\n22\n]. For instance, Neier (2023) identified segregation-based environmental inequality in Vienna [\n47\n], while in Beijing, lower-income areas have significantly reduced access to UGS, exacerbating spatial polarization between the rich and poor [\n21\n]. Scholars contend that this unequal distribution of ‘environmental goods’ like UGS is not coincidental but a consequence of long-term discriminatory policies [\n48\n]. The environmental marginalization of migrants was caused by a lack of recognition of their civic rights and informal livelihood strategies [\n49\n]. Additionally, their limited political capital often prompts governments and developers to pursue a ‘path of least resistance’, minimizing expenditure on environmental improvements at the expense of vulnerable groups [\n50\n]. The social effects of greenness, interlinked with rural-urban contexts, collectively influence one’s mental health.\nThis study, therefore, examines the impact of UGS on rural migrants’ perceived everyday discrimination and mental health outcomes. It further elucidates the heterogeneity of urban environments through comparative analyses of inner-city and inner-suburban areas. Building on the literature reviewed above, we propose:\nH3\nThe direct and indirect health impacts of UGS differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburb, demonstrating the Geo-Contextualization of these effects.\nWe validate the three hypotheses above by utilizing multisource data, incorporating the social survey, geospatial information, and urban environmental management data collected in Wuhan (see Fig.\n1\n). Our findings underscore the necessity of inclusive planning, design, and management of UGS, advocating for a nuanced approach that accounts for the diverse attributes of greenness to which environmentally vulnerable groups are particularly sensitive.\nFig. 1\nResearch design diagram\nFull size image\nStudy design\nData sources\nWe chose Wuhan as the study area for three reasons. First, Wuhan is undergoing rapid urbanization, similar to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, and it is one of the major migrant-receiving cities in China. According to the seventh national population census in 2020, the number of migrants in Wuhan reached 7.02 million, accounting for 32% of the total population, higher than the percentage (19.79%) in 2000 from the fifth national population census [\n51\n]. Second, there is a considerable geographical disparity in the residential environments of rural migrants in Wuhan. Statistics show that 35.4% resided in old inner areas, 28.7% in urban-rural fringes, and 16.6% in urban villages and squatter settlements [\n52\n]. This environmental heterogeneity underscores the importance of examining health issues across different ecological contexts. Third, following the COVID-19 outbreak, building a healthy city has been a leading strategy for Wuhan’s development\nFootnote\n1\n. These features make Wuhan a typical case.\nThe spatial planning of Chinese cities follows a hierarchical structure: administrative districts, sub-districts (\nJiedao\ns), and neighborhoods. Our primary data comes from the ‘\nWuhan Neighborhood Environment and Migrants’ Quality of Life Survey\n’, conducted from September to November 2018. To sample participants, first, we selected ten\nJiedao\ns from seven inner-city and three inner-suburb districts. Second, we implemented a street-interception, face-to-face survey for each selected\nJiedao\nin specific neighborhoods. To ensure diverse representation among respondents, we administered the survey in the neighborhoods’ high-density areas frequented by a wide range of residents. These locations included entrances of grocery stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, parks, and areas adjacent to subway stations. Interviewers underwent specialized training to ensure consistent, unbiased respondent recruitment. The respondents were provided informed oral consent and received payment after the survey. The Ethics Committee of Wuhan University approved it. We cleaned the data by removing samples that completed the survey in an extremely short time or records with missing values, eventually obtaining 716 valid samples covering 60 neighborhoods. During the preliminary survey, we encountered several challenges specific to conducting door-to-door household surveys among migrant populations. These included the population’s high mobility, reluctance to participate due to defensive attitudes, incomplete registration information in neighborhood data, and our human and financial resources constraints. Consequently, we strategically adopted a street-intercept interview approach. To minimize selection bias, we carefully controlled age and gender balance during the survey, ensuring a sample that closely matched the demographics of the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) (Table\n1\n), strengthening the generalizability of our findings. The participants classified as rural migrants were selected based on the criteria that they were over 18 years old and had lived in Wuhan for at least six months without a Wuhan\nhukou\n, aligning with the definition of CMDS.\nApart from the survey data, we employed the following three datasets: (1) Parks’ social media rating data: we obtained it from the\nDianping\nplatform (\nhttps://www.dianping.com\n) tagged geo-location (one of the most informative life services and place rating websites in China) (LBSM)(August 2022); (2) Baidu Street view images (BSVs): we captured them from Baidu Maps (\nhttp://lbsyun.baidu.com/\n) (March 2021), the Chinese equivalent of Google Maps, which can offer diverse views and detailed information about the actual surroundings; (3) Neighborhood environment data: we obtained it from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center (October 2020). This dataset covers information on land use, land surface vegetation cover, buildings, road networks, etc.\nTo address the 0–3 year lag between health and environmental data collection (2019.1–2022.12), we analyzed UGS changes, finding minimal landscape alteration (Fig.\n2\n). While 28 new parks were added, none were within 800 m of sampled areas. Given this stability, and supported by existing research [\n8\n], we believe the time lag’s impact on health outcomes is negligible, maintaining the credibility of our conclusions for urban green space planning and public health policy.\nFig. 2\nChanges in UGS development within the sampled areas\nFull size image\nMeasures\nMental health\nMental health was measured by the established Chinese version [\n53\n] of the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [\n54\n]. Respondents rated the frequency of experiencing six positive (e.g., enjoying daily activities, feeling happy) (1 =\nnever\nto 5 =\nalways\n) and six negative (e.g., losing sleep due to anxiety, feeling nervous) emotions over the past 12 months. To minimize response bias, positive and negative items were clearly distinguished, and response scales were reversed for negative items (i.e., 5 =\nnever\nto 1 =\nalways\n). Moreover, to prevent individuals with severe mental illness from concealing or overestimating their mental health status, we emphasized the anonymity and confidentiality of responses throughout the survey. We calculated the final GHQ-12 score by summing all items, with higher scores indicating better mental health. This scale has demonstrated reliability in global public health research on migrant populations [\n3\n,\n55\n,\n56\n]. It has been instrumental in identifying individuals at risk of mental health difficulties and facilitating comparisons with other research.\nNeighborhood greenness exposure\nExisting literature proposes various frameworks for measuring greenness exposure, including both overhead-view and eye-level perspectives [\n28\n], as well as subjective and objective dimensions [\n3\n]. Given the Chinese government’s policy focus and ongoing scholarly debate on the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS for vulnerable groups, this study evaluates rural migrants’ greenness exposure along these two critical dimensions.\nThis study centered on four common aspects of the\nquality\nof UGS [\n9\n,\n57\n]: overall satisfaction, social media ratings, greenspace disorder, and the presence of recreational plaza-type parks. Specifically, the overall satisfaction with UGS was measured by a 5-point Likert scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 5 = totally satisfied) based on the question, ‘How satisfied are you with the quality of greenspace in your neighborhood?’. Additionally, to capture public perceptions of park quality, we incorporated user-generated social media ratings from the\nDianping\nwebsite. This platform features anonymous reviews of parks, incorporating aspects like cost, aesthetics, and activity offerings. We calculated a weighted average rating for each neighborhood based on the five nearest parks, employing an inverse distance weighting method, as showed in Equation.\nA1\n, Appendix. Parks were weighted at 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1 [\n58\n], respectively, according to their proximity (calculated using road network distances) to the neighborhood centroid. The farthest park analyzed was within a 4.17 km radius, accessible within 30–60 min by public transportation [\n59\n]. This accessibility criterion ensured all parks were reachable within a reasonable timeframe, justifying our decision to set the weight of the fifth park to 0.1 instead of 0. Drawing upon established audit tools [\n9\n,\n57\n], we quantified greenspace disorder using data on environmental enforcement actions related to UGS management. This dataset, provided by the Wuhan City Urban Management and Law Enforcement Commission, documented instances of littering, solid waste accumulation, and maintenance issues (e.g., bare vegetation, inadequate facilities, or lighting) in UGS within an 800 m radius of each neighborhood. A higher density of reported cases signifies greater disorder within the UGS. Recreational plaza-type parks were identified as a crucial indicator of UGS quality. Park boundaries were extracted from remote sensing imagery, the Gaode Map platform, and the Wuhan City Park Directory (see Fig.\nA1\n, Appendix). We classified parks based on the ‘Urban Green Area Classification Standard CJJ/T 85-2017’\nFootnote\n2\nreleased by China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. This variable was operationalized as a binary indicator (1 = presence, 0 = absence).\nTo measure the\nquantity\nof UGS, we employed three widely used metrics [\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]: park density, park area ratio, and the Green View Index (GVI). These measures allow for meaningful comparisons with other studies and contexts. We calculated park density as the number of parks within an 800 m radius buffer around each neighborhood centroid. Park locations were extracted from points of interest (POIs) accessed through the Baidu Map API. The park area ratio, calculated as the proportion of land dedicated to parks, was derived using GIS data on land use classification obtained from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning Information Center. To quantify the visibility of greenery, we computed the GVI using Baidu Street View imagery [\n10\n]. Data collection points were established at 100-meter intervals along the road network within the 800 m buffer. At each point, we captured panoramic street-level images (500 × 500 pixels) in four cardinal directions (90°, 180°, 270°, 360°) using a Python script. We then employed a fully convolutional neural network (FCN-8s) for semantic segmentation, enabling the identification and extraction of green elements (e.g., trees, grass) within each image [\n10\n]. The GVI at each point was computed as the average proportion of green pixels across the four directional images. The neighborhood-level GVI was then determined by averaging the GVIs of all collection points within the corresponding buffer zone.\nPrior research has employed diverse definitions of ‘neighborhood,’ including Transportation Analysis Zones (\nTAZ\ns), zip codes, census tracts, blocks,\nJiedao\ns, and radial buffers ranging from 100 m to 2 km. Given the focus of this study on creating health-oriented neighborhoods, we defined ‘neighborhood’ using an 800 m radius buffer. This decision aligns with Wuhan’s ‘\nPlanning Action for 15-Minute Community Life Circle\n’ (2018), which designates a 500–800 m radius as the primary daily living space based on a 15-minute walking distance. This operationalization enhances the practical implications of our findings for urban planning and public health initiatives.\nPerceived everyday discrimination\nWe measured perceived everyday discrimination (PED) by adapting the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) [\n60\n]. This adapted scale, reflecting prevalent discrimination issues reported by Chinese migrants, comprises three items quantifying respondents’ experiences of being disliked, treated with contempt, and facing reluctance from the local population as neighbors. Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with higher summed scores indicating greater perceived discrimination. While this measure captures general daily discrimination rather than being green space-specific, we argue for its ecological validity as our study is situated within a broader investigation of neighborhood environments and migrant quality of life in Wuhan. Discrimination experienced by migrants permeates various aspects of daily life [\n40\n], including but not limited to UGS interactions operating within a broader social and spatial context. Literature also suggests that UGS-related discrimination often extends beyond geographical boundaries [\n2\n]. Examining everyday discrimination provides a more comprehensive lens for understanding environmental injustice experienced by migrants in urban settings.\nSociodemographic covariates\nWe included a set of individual characteristics as control variables [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n28\n], such as age, gender, and educational status (Table\n1\n). Personal annual income was also considered a dichotomy based on Wuhan’s per capita yearly income 2019\nFootnote\n3\n. A value of 1 (High) was assigned to the income above the average (≥ 50,000 CNY), while a value of 0 (Low) was given to the income below the average (<50,000 CNY). We grouped the residential location into inner-city (0) and inner-suburb (1).\nTable 1 Summary of variable statistics\nFull size table\nData analysis and modeling approach\nOur data analysis comprised three main steps. First, we performed descriptive analyses using\nChi\n-square and\nt\n-tests to examine statistical differences in UGS, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health across rural-urban contexts. Second, to address the hierarchical nature of our data (individuals nested within neighborhoods), we aggregated environmental data captured by each individual response to the neighborhood level. This aggregation was done by calculating the mean score for each environmental variable within each unique neighborhood identifier, effectively transitioning from individual-level to neighborhood-level data. Third, we applied Multilevel Structural Equation Models (MSEM) to test our hypotheses by examining the relationships between greenness exposure, the mediator, and mental health outcomes among rural migrants. We estimated the significance of each pathway, indirect effects, and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Multiple models were conducted to compute direct, indirect, and total effects within each pathway, considering different residential locations to understand their varying impacts in rural-urban contexts. The Variance Inflation Factor (\nVIF\n) for all variables averaged 1.4 (below the threshold of 5), suggesting the absence of severe multicollinearity. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16 [\n61\n], employing commands such as ‘ttest’, ‘gsem’, and ‘nlcom’.\nResults\nSample characteristics and contextual differences\nTable\n1\nprovides the descriptive statistics. The average score of the GHQ-12 was 46.42 (SD ± 5.03), close to the health score’s median value. 15.82% of the respondents reported having ‘always’ and ‘often’ lost much sleep due to over-anxiety and ‘feelings of nervousness,’ indicating that rural migrants in Wuhan generally experienced unsatisfactory mental health and some emotional distress. Additionally, groups residing in the inner-city exhibited more favorable mental health.\nFor the UGS\nquality\n, the average score of the general satisfaction and parks’ social media rating was 3.45 (SD ± 0.49) and 4.33 (SD ± 0.35), respectively. The average number of environmental management cases reported by residents was 2.86; over half of the neighborhoods (56.70%) had urban management problems with greening (with values exceeding 1). Only 30.59% had recreational plaza-type parks. For the\nquantity\n, the park density, park area ratio, and GVI averaged at 1.10 (SD ± 1.45), 0.09 (SD ± 0.16), and 0.28 (SD ± 0.07), respectively.\nTable\n2\nillustrates the disparities in UGS characteristics across rural-urban contexts. Inner-city neighborhoods, where migrant workers reside, exhibited higher park density (by 1.12 units) and park area ratio (by 0.06) compared to inner-suburban areas. Conversely, the inner-suburb demonstrated a significantly higher green view index (by 0.05 units). Qualitatively, inner-city respondents reported greater perceived greenery satisfaction (by 0.38) and higher park social media ratings (by 0.23). However, these areas also faced more greenspace disorder issues, with environmental management cases exceeding those in inner-suburban areas by 1.01. Inner-suburban areas, in contrast, featured a higher proportion of recreational plaza-type parks. These findings reveal unequal access to UGS among migrant populations across the rural-urban continuum.\nAdditionally, rural migrants experience a moderate everyday discrimination from local residents, with an average score of 6.40 (SD ± 1.90) out of 15. While the difference isn’t statistically significant, the data indicates a potential trend where migrants in inner-suburban areas may face slightly higher levels of discrimination than those in inner-city areas. This marginal difference of 0.21 could be explored further in future research to determine its significance and potential underlying factors.\nTable 2 Greeness exposure, perceived everyday discrimination, and mental health: rural-urban context differences\nFull size table\nModel parameter estimates\nWe ran the model of the direct health effects of UGS, accounting for covariates. Subsequently, the model was re-estimated to include the discrimination factor as a mediator. Model fit was evaluated by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (\nAIC\n) and Bayesian Information Criterion (\nBIC\n) across the two models [\n62\n], with lower values indicating better model fit. As shown in Table\n3\n, across both the overall sample and the subsamples categorized by residential location, models incorporating perceived discrimination (Models 2, 4, 6) exhibited lower\nAIC\nand\nBIC\nvalues compared to those without (Models 1, 3, 5), suggesting its potential role as a social mediator in these associations.\nTable 3 Model fitting parameters\nFull size table\nModeling results: associations between UGS, discrimination, and mental health\nTable\n4\npresents the detailed modeling results, illustrating the direct, indirect, and total effects. As hypothesized (\nH1\n) and evidenced by the model, the\nquantity\nof UGS demonstrates a more decisive influence on the mental health of rural migrants in Wuhan compared to\nquality\naspects, partially contradicting previous studies on the general population [\n14\n,\n15\n]. However, these effects differ significantly between inner-city and inner-suburban areas (Tables\nA1\nand\nA2\n, see Appendix), highlighting the importance of considering the\nquality\nand\nquantity\nof UGS concerning the Geo-Contextualization of health effects.\nSpecifically, high park density was significantly and positively correlated with mental health among rural migrants overall (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.119,\np\n< 0.05), with a stronger effect in the inner-city area (\nβ\ndirect\n= 1.412,\np\n< 0.01, Appendix, Table\nA1\n). Additionally, each percentage point increase in GVI was associated with a 8.45-point rise in mental health scores, a benefit particularly evident in suburban areas. However, the relationship between\nquantity\nand mental health is not always straightforward. Unexpectedly, a larger park area ratio is associated with poorer mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= -3.611,\np\n< 0.1), especially for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -7.568,\np\n< 0.05, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding challenges previous studies [\n4\n,\n7\n] and suggests that simply increasing park size may not necessarily translate into better health, particularly in areas already abundant in greenness.\nDespite the dominant influence of\nquantity\n,\nqualitative\naspects of UGS also demonstrate significant, albeit context-dependent, associations with mental health. Social media ratings of parks show a significant, positive association with mental health (\nβ\ndirect\n= 2.142,\np\n< 0.01), but only in inner-suburban neighborhoods (\nβ\ndirect\n= 6.019,\np\n-value = 0.015, Appendix, Table\nA2\n). This finding suggests that living near highly-rated parks, especially those praised for their scenery, aesthetics, and overall attractiveness, may significantly improve mental health for inner-suburban migrants. Interestingly, perceived greenery satisfaction holds a nanced relationship. While generally positive, this relationship becomes significantly negative within the inner-city (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.137,\np\n-value = 0.056). This could be attributed to the confounding influence of housing market dynamics, where high greenspace satisfaction often coincides with elevated property values, potentially offsetting the mental health benefits [\n63\n]. Furthermore, the mental health benefits of recreational plaza-type parks appear to be context-dependent, specifically benefiting inner-city migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= 0.996,\np\n< 0.1) while not showing the same effect, and potentially even a slightly negative (although statistically insignificant) one, for inner-suburban migrants (\nβ\ndirect\n= -1.253,\np\n> 0.1).\nTable 4 Results of MSEM in direct, indirect, and total effects\nFull size table\nFurthermore, our findings confirm\nH2\nand\nH3\nabout the role of perceived everyday discrimination in the relationship between UGS and mental health, and reveal critical differences between urban and suburban areas. In suburban areas, urban greenery more directly benefits mental health. However, in inner-city areas, the experience of discrimination plays a crucial mediating role. Specifically, for inner-city migrants, living near parks with recreational plazas is linked to better mental health, partly because it reduces experiences of discrimination (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.332, 95% CI: 0.060 to 0.605, Appendix Table\nA1\n). This contrasts sharply with rural migrants, especially those in inner-suburban areas, who showed a strong negative correlation between perceived discrimination and mental health (Fig. 3). While some trends suggested that greenspaces with favorable social media ratings (suburban) and satisfaction (inner-city) might also reduce discriminatory experiences (Fig.\n3\n), these did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, while access to high-quality UGS may lessen the negative mental health impacts of discrimination, particularly for inner-city migrants, this effect is not consistently observed across all rural-urban settings.\nWhile UGS\nquality\ngenerally produces the positive social outcomes, the relationship between their\nquantity\nand social dynamics is more nuanced. The social functions of UGS, such as reducing discrimination, appear to reverse under certain quantitative conditions. A high proportion of greenness, particularly in the inner-city (\nβ\nindirect\n= -0.965, 95% CI: -1.843 to -0.087, Appendix Table\nA1\n), was associated with increased perceived discrimination and consequently poorer mental health. This phenomenon may be attributed to these areas primarily serving as city-level parks [\n59\n], where proximate neighborhoods have experienced social segregation related to household registration or income, thereby amplifying discrimination and adversely impacting rural migrants’ mental health. Conversely, higher park density was linked to lower perceived discrimination and improved mental health (\nβ\nindirect\n= 0.078, 95% CI: -0.084 to 0.239, Table\n4\n), suggesting that accessible UGS can facilitate social integration.\nUltimately, this study highlights the health influence of both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of UGS and differs across specific urban-rural contexts. In inner-suburban areas, proximity to moderately sized parks but high social media ratings and visibility significantly contributes to positive mental health outcomes for migrants. Conversely, in inner-city areas, high park density and recreational plaza-type parks prove more beneficial. Perceived discrimination emerges as a critical psychosocial mechanism. Neighborhood parks designed as recreational squares can indirectly promote mental health by mitigating perceived discrimination. However, a high proportion of UGS in an area may inadvertently exacerbate social segregation, negatively impacting mental health. These findings emphasize that the effective green spaces planning must consider their both\nquality\nand\nquantity\nacross different urban zones to maximize health benefits for rural migrants.\nFig. 3\nSignificant pathways across rural-urban contexts. *\np\n< 0.1; **\np\n< 0.05; ***\np\n< 0.01\nFull size image\nDiscussions\nUnder the ‘mobility turn’ in environmental health studies, the importance of neighborhood greenness exposure for rural migrants’ mental health has received growing attention. Taking Wuhan as a typical case, our study reveals that both the\nquantity\nand\nquality\nof UGS significantly impact migrants’ mental health, with\nquantity\ndemonstrating a stronger correlation. This contrasts with findings from low-density cities, such as those in the Netherlands [\n9\n] and Australia [\n15\n], where the\nquality\nhas been strongly influenced. The inconclusive results can be attributed to the city-specific urban form and the progress made in greening. The high-density built environment, fragmented spatial layout resulting from the presence of rivers and lakes, and transportation challenges inherent to Wuhan exemplify how these factors can exacerbate unequal access to UGS. These findings underscore the urgency for Wuhan to prioritize equitable green space development.\nA focus on detailed information revealed that only the social media ratings of parks exerted a positive influence. Unexpectedly, a higher proportion of park area was linked to poorer mental health. This finding corroborates extant literature suggesting a non-linear correlation between UGS and psychological well-being, aligning with the hypothesized ‘Greenery Saturation Effect’. The theory suggests that surpassing an optimal UGS exposure threshold may elicit adverse emotional responses [\n64\n]. Various studies provide evidence for this effect. For instance, Australian children’s happiness peaked with 21–40% green space coverage [\n65\n], while older adults’ overall health was optimal at an NDVI of 0.4 [\n66\n]. Exceeding these levels may yield diminishing returns or even detrimental effects on mental health. Several factors could explain this counterintuitive relationship. Larger parks often struggle with adequate security and lighting, potentially increasing crime risk and residents’ fear and stress [\n67\n]. For migrants in particular, extensive parklands may paradoxically restrict their opportunities for interaction with local residents, thus contributing to social isolation and negatively impacting mental health. Moreover, as illustrated by our fieldwork (Fig.\n4\n), prioritizing UGS for vulnerable groups concentrated in urban villages and affordable housing can strain municipal budgets. This financial burden often results in inadequate maintenance, reduced amenities, and diminished UGS quality, thereby undermining the intended health benefits. In conclusion, while green spaces generally support mental health, their effectiveness depends on factors beyond mere\nquantity\n, including\nquality\nand social considerations.\nFig. 4\nObservations of UGS conditions in migrant settlements (July 2021) By author.\nNote\nurban villages in the inner-city (Left) and affordable housing neighborhoods in the inner-suburb (Right)\nFull size image\nWe also observe the health effects of UGS differing along the rural-urban gradient. In inner-city areas, a higher density of parks directly promotes migrants’ mental health. Conversely, in suburban areas, the quality of parks, as indicated by social media ratings, has a more significant positive impact. This disparity can be attributed to Wuhan’s uneven distribution of ecological resources, particularly its circular arrangement of larger, more ecological suburban parks, contributes to this disparity\nFootnote\n4\n. While expansive, these parks face management and social functionality challenges. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between suburban migrants’ mental health and park area proportion, potentially due to increased exposure to fragmented greenness. Limited mobility in transit deserts may further exacerbate this issue [\n68\n]. These differing inner-city and suburban outcomes highlight divergent social processes. Inner-city green spaces can mitigate the mental health impacts of daily discrimination, an effect absent in suburban settings. This discrepancy likely stems from two interconnected factors related to Wuhan’s suburban environment: its rural-like nature, which can exacerbate migrants’ social withdrawal [\n41\n], and its highly segregated socio-spatial structure [\n69\n]. Both contribute to migrants interacting almost exclusively within their own identity group, thus impairing their sense of place and belonging. Consequently, suburban green spaces, despite their potential, minimally buffer the mental health impacts of discrimination among migrants compared to inner-city counterparts.\nThis study offers threefold contributions to the understanding of the health effects of UGS on the migrant population: (1) Geo-Contextualization of health effects: We demonstrate that the mental health outcomes of rural-to-urban migrants in urban China are significantly influenced by their residential location (inner-city vs. inner-suburb), highlighting the context-dependent nature of individual outcomes. (2) Nuanced green space impacts: While affirming the general health benefits of UGS for rural migrants, an overabundance of greenery, particularly in suburban areas, can be detrimental. Urban planning must balance UGS\nquality\nand\nquantity\n. (3) Contextual moderation of discrimination: We uncover spatially heterogeneous effects, with social mechanisms, such as reduced perceived everyday discrimination, driving the health benefits of UGS in inner-city areas. Conversely, in inner-suburban areas, these benefits manifest more directly, reflecting the influence of localized landscape characteristics and population distribution. This research builds upon and refines existing studies on the diverse health impacts of UGS across rural-urban gradients, emphasizing the need for context-specific urban planning interventions.\nDespite the study’s contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, while widely used, self-reported measures like the GHQ-12 are susceptible to response bias. Future research would benefit from incorporating additional mental health instruments, such as the GAD-7 and PSS, for cross-validation and exploring migrant-specific mental health concerns. Secondly, although socioeconomic variables were controlled for, the potential impact of mobility experience on rural migrants’ mental health warrants further investigation. Finally, due to data limitations restricting analysis to UGS presence, this study may underestimate migrants’ frequency and duration of UGS use. Future studies should collect detailed usage information to better understand its relationship with mental health, considering both availability and actual utilization.\nThese findings have several policy implications for developing healthy and inclusive cities. Firstly, while increasing urban green space is generally beneficial, a nuanced approach to balancing quantity with strategic quality enhancements is crucial. Policies should prioritize optimizing park density, visibility, and social value to cultivate positive public perception, particularly for environmentally disadvantaged populations. Secondly, designing inclusive and social green spaces is essential to mitigate potential discriminatory practices. This involves prioritizing human-scale designs that promote interaction and discourage territorial behavior. Additionally, government and community-led programming can foster social cohesion and intercultural exchange, cultivating a sense of belonging among migrants. Lastly, embracing context-specific design is vital. Inner-city interventions should focus on increasing park density through pocket parks and recreational plazas, while suburban strategies should enhance the social functionality of existing green spaces through improved amenities and engaging activities. By tailoring green space design to specific user groups and settings, cities can maximize the positive impact of these spaces on community well-being and social integration.\nData availability\nThe data is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Urban green space, perceived everyday discrimination and mental health among rural-to-urban migrants: a multilevel analysis in Wuhan, China' presents a compelling exploration of the relationship between urban green spaces (UGS) and mental health, specifically within a demographic that experiences unique stressors, such as rural-to-urban migrants. This study is directly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being as it systematically assesses how UGS can play a crucial role in improving mental health outcomes among a socially marginalized group. By examining both the quality and quantity of urban green spaces, the authors reveal that enhanced access to well-maintained green areas is associated with better mental health indicators, thereby providing empirical support for the claim that urban green spaces contribute positively to community well-being.\n\nThe methodology employed a multilevel analysis which is particularly robust in this context, as it captures data at both individual and community levels. The researchers collected data through surveys from rural-to-urban migrants in Wuhan, addressing perceptions of everyday discrimination, which acts as an intermediary in the mental health impacts of UGS. By integrating both qualitative and quantitative data, the study demonstrates high evidence quality, especially through the application of rigorous statistical techniques which enhance the validity of the findings.\n\nThe significance of the findings is highlighted not only in their statistical correlations but also in their social implications. The paper suggests that urban green spaces serve as a buffer against mental health issues that arise from discrimination and social marginalization. This is crucial for urban planners and policymakers as it helps underline the necessity of investing in quality green spaces, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas where vulnerable populations might otherwise experience heightened mental health risks.\n\nHowever, the study does possess limitations and potential biases that must be acknowledged. One notable limitation is the focus on a specific demographic (rural-to-urban migrants) which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups. Moreover, the reliance on self-reported measures for both mental health and perceived discrimination could introduce bias due to individual perception differences and social desirability effects. Such biases could lead to over- or under-reporting of negative mental health outcomes tied to UGS access. Additionally, while the paper controls for various confounding factors, there may still be socio-economic variables that influence both the perception of discrimination and mental health which were not included in the analysis. Such contexts could potentially skew the results, suggesting a need for further research across different populations and settings to reinforce these findings. Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to understanding how urban green spaces can tangibly enhance community well-being, particularly among marginalized populations, which is an essential consideration in urban development and public health policies.",

SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20. As a consequence of decades of beneficial soil management practices, such as the application of compost21, urban garden soils may not always 1Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Department of Soil Sciences, Ackerstrasse 113, 5070, Frick, CH, Switzerland. 2Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, Zürcherstrasse 111, 8903, Birmensdorf, CH, Switzerland. 3University of Neuchâtel, Institute of Biology, Functional Ecology Laboratory, Rue Emile-Argand 11, 2000, Neuchâtel, CH, Switzerland. 4ETHZ, Department of Environmental System Science, Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Universitaetstrasse 16, 8092, Zurich, CH, Switzerland. 5University of Konstanz, Department of Biology, Ecology, Universitätstrasse 10, 78464, Konstanz, DE, Germany.

Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2.

Conditional R2s, based on the variance of both the fixed and random effects, as well as marginal R2s, based on the fixed effect parts for each component models are given in the boxes of the response variables. Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Direct and indirect effects of urban gardening on aboveground and belowground diversity influencing soil multifunctionality\" by Simon Tresch et al. investigates the intricate relationships between urban gardening, biodiversity, and soil health, which are salient factors when discussing the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. The authors argue that urban gardens not only serve as recreational spaces but also contribute significantly to ecosystem services that are essential for sustaining human well-being. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The research firmly establishes that urban gardens, categorized as green spaces, support both plant and soil fauna diversity, which directly correlates with enhanced multifunctionality of the soil. The claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being is reinforced by the findings that urban gardens can provide essential ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and improved soil quality. These services are crucial for a flourishing urban environment that directly affects the quality of life for its inhabitants. The effects documented in the paper underscore the potential of urban gardening to enhance local biodiversity, which in turn fosters a healthier living environment. This connection affirms the role of urban green spaces in promoting community well-being through the dual lens of environmental sustainability and public health.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The study employed a robust methodology involving an extensive sampling effort across 85 urban gardens in Zurich, incorporating a rich dataset that includes approximately 600 plant species and various soil fauna, which consists of 18 species of earthworms and 39 species of springtails. The comparative approach allows the researchers to draw conclusions about the impact of gardening practices on soil health and biodiversity. Furthermore, the quantitative analyses performed on the relationship between aboveground diversity (plants) and belowground diversity (soil organisms) bolster the reliability of the conclusions. Resulting from a series of field observations and targeted investigations, the evidence quality is high, given the rigorous assessment of the ecological data collected over a considerable geographical area, which mitigates potential localized biases and provides more generalized insights about urban gardens.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings show a clear positive relationship between high plant diversity in urban gardens and the health of soil biodiversity, subsequently enhancing soil multifunctionality. This has significant implications for urban planning and community development, as it points towards the necessity of preserving and creating diverse urban green spaces to foster both ecological resilience and human health. The study highlights the need for urban planners and local governments to prioritize biodiversity in urban agricultural practices to harness these ecological benefits, ultimately aiming to enhance community well-being. The acknowledgement of gardening activities as an avenue for bolstering both vegetation and soil health further suggests that themed community gardening initiatives can serve as powerful tools in urban environmental management. \n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: While the study offers insightful conclusions, it is not free from limitations. One potential bias stems from the geographical focus on Zurich, which may not fully capture variability presented in urban gardening across different climatic and urban contexts. The findings might be influenced by local environmental conditions, gardening practices, and community engagement levels, suggesting that results could differ in another city with contrasting ecological or sociocultural dynamics. Additionally, the intensity of garden management was noted to negatively affect plant diversity, but this relationship requires a deeper exploration into the types of management practices that can optimize both biodiversity and soil health. The cross-sectional nature of the study also raises questions about the long-term impacts of urban gardening over time, as well as the implications of unaddressed confounding variables that could affect the observed relationships.",

Introduction\nUrban greening is a major goal in policies for sustainable cities [\n1\n,\n2\n], and the use of urban green space (UGS) to address health and well-being issues related to urban spatial design, such as heat stress and mental stress, is increasingly advocated for [\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n]. Hence, urban policy makers and spatial planners have developed a strong interest in using urban greening for the benefit of resident well-being and urban sustainability [\n8\n,\n9\n]. Currently, most science-based guidelines and urban policies deal with the various health benefits and burdens of UGS separately [\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n]. For example, the impacts of UGS on heat stress in the context of climate adaptation are addressed in isolation from other relevant UGS impacts on urban health [\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]. Moreover, guidelines are often unclear about the quantitative dimension, e.g., how much UGS is needed in a city or neighborhood to achieve a desired level of health benefits. Additionally, urban planners are confronted with contradictory messages because UGS can also have negative consequences for human health through impacts on, for example, pollen concentration and social safety, and the issue- and situation-specific nature of available guidelines and support tools further add to the complexity of UGS planning to promote residents’ health and well-being [\n16\n].\nA spatial model named Urban-EcoMATCH (Urban Ecosystems Mapping and Assessment Tool of Costs and Benefits for Health), presented in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n], however, offers the possibility to support the development of ‘healthy’ urban greening strategies in an integrated, quantitative, and context-specific way, accounting for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. In this study, the model is applied to assess the performance of alternative UGS design scenarios as compared to the current situation. This explorative strategic scenario study [\n18\n] aims to answer ‘what-if’ questions regarding UGS design for a concrete, specific case (the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands) but also to generate broader insights concerning effective urban greening strategies with respect to health and climate resilience. With its integrated approach, the study fills a gap left by recent scenario-based assessments of UGS design [\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n,\n23\n], which focused on certain specific benefits of UGS, such as promoting active transport [\n24\n] or adapting to climate change by reducing heat stress [\n25\n] or the risks of urban flooding [\n26\n]. The study also covers several health issues that, thus far, have not been addressed in other UGS scenario-based assessments, namely, the effects of UGS on mental stress from visually unattractive cityscapes, social safety, and tick-borne infectious diseases.\nIn the next sections, we first present the study approach and introduce the UGS design scenarios, which will be assessed with respect to human health and well-being. Then, we describe the results of this integrated scenario assessment. In the final section, we discuss the major findings and their implications for urban greening strategies, as well as the limitations of the study in this regard. We end with a conclusion on the value of the presented approach and on priorities for further research.\n2. Methods\nIn this section, we first briefly describe the scenario study approach and input data. Then, we explain in more detail the different UGS design scenarios that were assessed with the model and the thresholds used in this assessment.\n2.1. Scenario Study Approach and Input Data\nFor each of the four UGS design scenarios, including two alternative greening strategy scenarios, the indicator values of five health determinants were estimated per street segment, with the spatial model described in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]. These five health determinants concerned ‘Unattractive views’, ‘Heat stress’, ‘Air pollution’, ‘Perceived unsafety’, and ‘Tick-bite risk’. The UGS contributions to these determinants were calculated by comparing the determinant values in the ‘Current greenspace’, ‘Green parking lots and squares’, and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios with the values in the ‘No greenspace’ scenario. The performance of the two alternative greening strategy scenarios (‘Green parking lots and squares’, ‘Optimized greenspace locations’) was assessed relative to the current situation (‘Current greenspace’) and relative to each other.\nFor the scenario assessment, overall, city-scale indicator values for the five health determinants were calculated as the area-weighted average of the indicator values for all street segments. Furthermore, for each street segment, the model-estimated indicator values of the health determinants were compared with a pre-set threshold value. With these thresholds, an additional indicator of the health effects of each scenario was calculated: the number (and proportion) of street segments where the indicator value of a health determinant exceeded the threshold. This may be a more policy-relevant indicator to compare the UGS design scenarios because locations where one or more thresholds are exceeded are likely to attract the attention of urban policy makers and planners. The value of this indicator will not differ between scenarios if differences in UGS impacts, as reflected in different average indicator values, do not result in more or less exceedance of the threshold.\nTo generate the UGS design for the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario, a module was added to the original model (\nFigure 1\n). Further information on the model, as well as a detailed description of the five health determinants included, can be found in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]. To run the spatial model, we used several input datasets that are all publicly available for the full Dutch territory and that are often high in resolution (<1 m). See Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n] for a more elaborate description of the input data.\nThe case study area for this scenario study is the built-up area of Maastricht, The Netherlands. It is a city in the south of the Netherlands, with 122,000 inhabitants [\n27\n]. Within the Netherlands, Maastricht is an interesting case in which to apply the model, primarily because it has a heterogeneous urban morphology. We used data from the year 2018 for all datasets. For a further description of reasons to focus on Maastricht and its health situation related to the assessed health benefits and burdens, see Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n].\nFigure 2\npresents a map of the study area, including the borders of the built-up area and the buffer area for geo-processing, as well as the location of the example areas that we use to visualize the results.\n2.2. UGS Design Scenarios\nThis section introduces the UGS design scenarios for which health impacts were assessed with the model. For all scenarios, privately-owned UGSs were included, but only UGSs in public areas and areas of private owners accessible to the public (pedestrians) were changed in the alternative UGS design scenarios. As such, these scenarios only include design options that are—in principle—within the power of urban spatial planners to implement. For a visual impression of the four UGS design scenarios at street level, see\nFigure 3\n.\n2.2.1. Scenario ‘No Greenspace’\nThis scenario assumes that Maastricht does not have any public UGS at all. Trees are removed, and currently (year 2018) existing shrubs, herbs, and grass are replaced by sealed soil. This scenario represents the so-called reference scenario, which is used to estimate the UGS contributions to health in the other scenarios. This is conducted by calculating the difference between the health determinant indicator values estimated in this reference scenario and those in the scenarios with greenspace.\n2.2.2. ‘Current Greenspace’ Scenario\nIn this scenario, aerial imagery and topographic maps were combined to reconstruct the UGS situation for the built-up area of Maastricht in the year 2018 (see Appendix B in Oosterbroek et al. [\n17\n]). Other elements of the spatial design of Maastricht that influence health determinants, for example, those related to buildings, roads, and cars, were also extracted from the 2018 datasets.\n2.2.3. ‘Green Parking Lots and Squares’ Scenario\nMaastricht’s urban planners have the ambition to green part of the less used parking lots, as well as part of the city’s squares, and they are interested in what effects this may have on health benefits and burdens [\n28\n]. As we expected that the city-scale effects on health determinants of the original plans would be very small, we developed a scenario that represents a more extreme version of this ambition, in which all parking lots are replaced by grass fields with shrubs, and all squares are replaced by grass fields with trees. The purpose of this more extreme version of the planners’ ambition is to determine the potential of this greening strategy. The greening of all parking lots and squares would add 4% additional UGS cover, expressed as a percentage of Maastricht’s built-up area in 2018.\nAnticipating a preference of residents for an open landscape, shrubs added in this scenario were of a modest size (1.2 m in height). Moreover, in line with the municipality’s ambition to increase urban biodiversity, larger trees (20 m in diameter, 12 m in height) were added where space allowed this, reasoning that one large tree increases biodiversity more than two smaller trees.\n2.2.4. ‘Optimized Greenspace Locations’ Scenario\nThis scenario uses the UGS volume (i.e., number and size of UGS elements) from the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario but employs the computer model to redistribute the current UGS over the built-up area of Maastricht to optimize health benefits. All health determinants have the same priority in this scenario: UGS will be located (‘planted’) in areas with an equally high suitability for each of the UGS benefits and an equally low suitability for each of the UGS burdens (see\nBox 1\nfor further explanation). In contrast to the scenario ‘Greening of parking lots and squares’, this scenario does not add any UGS elements compared to the 2018 situation. Hence, the purpose of this scenario is to show the potential benefits of the same amount of UGS when locations are chosen such that health benefits are maximized and burdens minimized.\nBox 1.\nProcessing steps to create the urban green space design scenario, ‘Optimized greenspace locations’.\nStep 1:\nFirstly, we identified areas in Maastricht’s built-up area that may have potential for UGS (re)design. We only selected public areas and areas of private owners that are accessible to the public (pedestrians). Within these areas, we selected areas that were not covered by water, buildings, or roads (including footpaths), such as squares, lawns, herbaceous areas, hedges, areas planted with trees, parking lots, squares, and paved areas around buildings. See\nFigure 4\nA for an example of the location, number, and size of these areas in this ‘potential UGS areas map’.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, we constructed a separate ‘UGS location suitability map’ for each of the five health determinants. This location suitability map was created by running the model for all locations within the potential UGS areas map from Step 1 and calculating the UGS contribution. Subsequently, (detrimental) health determinant indicator values for the UGS contribution were inverted and normalized to range 0–1 by setting the highest value in the study area to zero (the most detrimental health effects and lowest suitability) and the lowest value to one (least detrimental health effects, highest suitability). In this ‘location suitability map’, the lowest suitability values result from no/lowest beneficial UGS effects or highest detrimental UGS effects in the case of health-related burdens and vice versa. For example, for the UGS location suitability map for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’, the lowest suitability scores were assigned to all locations that would not at all be visible by pedestrians. See\nFigure 4\nB,C for examples of tree location suitability maps for the health determinants ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nStep 3:\nNext, we calculated the total area covered by tree crowns within UGS design scenario, ‘Current green space’ (representing the situation in 2018). Subsequently, an area with the highest suitability scores for all health determinants was selected, with the size of this area being just sufficiently large enough to accommodate the total tree crown area. The result was a ‘highest benefits and lowest burdens map’ with sufficient space to accommodate all trees from the current UGS scenario (\nFigure 4\nD). Hence, this map indicates the potential UGS areas that are most suitable to accommodate the total area covered by trees in the most ‘healthy’ way. A similar procedure was implemented to identify the most suitable potential UGS areas to accommodate the other UGS types: shrubs, herbs, and grass (see\nAppendix A\n). Finally, the model was run for all UGS types at these ‘optimal’ locations together to take the effect of possible UGS interactions into account.\nFigure 4.\nExamples illustrating, for example, area 1 with the stepwise method to identify areas highly suitable for trees in view of multiple health determinants.

(\nD\n) ‘High benefits and low burdens map’ for health determinant ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nIn Maastricht’s built-up area, the space available for optimizing UGS in support of residents’ health is rather limited, especially in the city center. In 2018, grass, herbs, and shrubs covered 30% of the built-up area (including both public and private UGS), whilst tree crowns covered 15%. As tree stems do not take up much space, about 30–31% of the surface cover of the built-up area was covered by UGS. Only 8% of the built-up area’s surface is covered by areas that have potential for implementing UGS (re)design. This is mainly because 41% of Maastricht’s built-up area consists of roads, buildings, and water. Moreover, 21% of the built-up area consists of private areas without UGS that are not accessible to the public. The surface of such private areas mainly consists of paved area (roads, parking lots) or storage area (e.g., for sand and building materials). We assume that the space available for optimizing UGS in other cities in the Netherlands will not differ greatly from the Maastricht case.\nThe ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario was generated with module 9 (\nFigure 1\n). The process of determining optimal UGS locations can be divided into three distinct steps, which are described in\nBox 1\nand\nFigure 4\n. We will explain Steps 2 and 3 using specific examples of location optimization for trees and for the health determinants ‘Unattractive views’ and ‘Air pollution’.\nAppendix A\nexplains the geoprocessing methods applied in these steps in detail, including all parameter values and sources used.\n2.3. Threshold Values to Assess and Compare UGS Design Scenarios\nTo assess the health impacts of the UGS design scenarios, the model-estimated indicator values of the health determinants were compared with threshold values for each health determinant (see\nTable 1\n). The chosen thresholds have different origins. The heat stress and air pollution thresholds were based on peer-reviewed literature and official WHO guidelines, respectively [\n29\n,\n30\n]. However, it should be noted that these choices are still pragmatic to a certain extent. Regarding the threshold for air pollution, the NO\n2\nconcentration, below which health effects do not occur, is much lower and often below background values [\n31\n]. Regarding the threshold for heat stress, temperatures above 35 °C PET are already categorized as ‘strong heat stress’ [\n29\n], and this level is easily met for every street segment during a heatwave day in Maastricht. For example, air temperature at the hottest heatwave day in 2018 reached 37.5 °C [\n32\n], and the model-estimated values for all street segments of Maastricht were above 35 °C PET. ‘Extreme Heat Stress Level 2’ (and not Level 1 or 3) was chosen to make differences between UGS design scenarios visible: it is a threshold value for which the frequency of exceedance varies between 0 and 100 percent for all scenarios. The thresholds for unattractive views, perceived (social) unsafety, and tick-bite risk are based on intuitive cut-off values. Unattractive view indicator values above zero mean that unattractive objects are more dominant within the pedestrian’s field of view than attractive objects, so these areas are scored as ‘net unattractive’. A perceived social unsafety score of 50 is right in between the minimum and maximum scores, so a street segment with this score would be perceived as neither really safe nor really unsafe. Finally, a threshold value of 1% for a tick-bite risk may intuitively make sense, as people seem to perceive chances larger than one percent as being much more significant in general [\n33\n]. This indicator can be considered the chance of being bitten during May to September, the period during which ticks are most active [\n34\n].\n3. Results\n3.1. Greenspace Design Per Scenario\nTo show how the different scenarios work in greenspace design, example area 1 is used to illustrate the differences. Example area 1, located in the city center, can, on a more general level, be regarded as representative of the entire built-up area of Maastricht. It contains types of footpath surroundings that are dominant in the city, such as residential roads, more central local roads with a high traffic intensity, and squares. However, example area 1 does not include a park, whilst the city contains several parks. This also explains why the fraction of open area (the area without buildings/total area) is lower than that in the entire built-up area of Maastricht (70% vs. 82%). However, the differences in UGS design that we discuss below are illustrative for the entire built-up area of Maastricht and apply to other areas in the city as well.\nFigure 5\nshows the green space design in example area 1 for the reference scenario (\nFigure 5\nA), as well as for the three UGS design scenarios (\nFigure 5\nB–D). The ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario (\nFigure 5\nC) shows the effect of replacing all parking lots with grass fields with shrubs and all squares with grass fields with trees. Compared with the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario (\nFigure 5\nB), these areas are added as greenspace areas. However, for the entire built-up area of Maastricht, the part taken up by parking lots and squares is small (4%), so health effects can be expected to be relatively small as well. Moreover, most parking lots are individual (dispersed) parking lots alongside and mostly parallel to the road. In these areas, there is often only space to add just one type of UGS. In these cases, we added only shrubs (hedgerows), as their volume is higher than that of mown grass. This potentially yields more benefits than mown grass in terms of reducing heat stress, unattractive views, and air pollution. Comparing the ‘Current greenspace’ (\nFigure 5\nB) and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios (\nFigure 5\nD) shows that in the optimized scenario, fewer trees and more hedgerows are located next to roads that are more traffic intensive. The opposite is true for less busy roads, such as residential streets, which now contain more trees and less hedgerows next to roads. Furthermore, in the scenario ‘Optimized greenspace locations’, squares are populated with more trees and filled with herbs and grass around these trees, while in parks, shrubs and herbs are removed from below trees. Trees further away from footpaths are partially removed as well and moved closer to footpaths, for example, in residential areas. Finally, in all types of footpath surroundings, trees, shrubs, and grass were relocated somewhat closer to footpaths.\n3.2. Health Benefits and Burdens Per Scenario\nTable 2\npresents the results regarding health benefits and burdens and the associated contributions of UGS for the reference scenario (‘No greenspace’) and the three UGS design scenarios (‘Current green space’; ‘Green parking lots and squares’; ‘Optimized greenspace locations’).\nFigure 6\n,\nFigure 7\n,\nFigure 8\n,\nFigure 9\nand\nFigure 10\nshow these results at a neighborhood scale (within the example areas) to give an impression of local variation in the values of health determinants and UGS contributions. In these figures and table, the UGS contributions are expressed such that negative values should be interpreted as beneficial for human health because they reduce detrimental health determinant values. Vice versa, positive UGS contribution values should be interpreted as detrimental for human health. Values for health determinants, such as unattractive views, can also be negative, which should be interpreted as beneficial for health as well, as negative scores mean that attractive objects are more dominant for a certain footpath segment.\nOverall,\nTable 2\nshows that with the current UGS design of Maastricht’s built-up area, numerous street segments exceed the threshold values (provided in\nTable 1\n). Yet, for heat stress and unattractive views, the average indicator value and, in particular, the exceedance frequency is reduced compared to the ‘No greenspace’ scenario, indicating substantial health benefits of the current UGS. For perceived unsafety and tick-bite risk, and, to a lesser extent, for air pollution, the average indicator value and exceedance frequency are higher, indicating that current UGS has a detrimental effect on health with respect to these determinants. Compared to the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario, implementation of the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario is estimated to result in a further decrease in heat stress and unattractive views and a slight increase in perceived unsafety and tick-bite risk. The UGS contribution to air pollution remains relatively small but changes from a burden into a benefit. The implementation of the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario is estimated to only slightly increase the perceived unsafety whilst (beneficially) decreasing the indicator values of the four other health determinants. This translates into even stronger reductions in the number of street segments that exceed threshold levels, especially for heat stress, unattractive views, and tick-bite risk. However, for unattractive views, the exceedance frequency did not decrease as much as in the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario. This is because street segments that scored lower (i.e., were considered more attractive) in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario were mainly those that already scored below the unattractive views threshold in the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario.\nThe following paragraphs detail the changes in UGS design and their associated effects on health determinants for the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ and ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenarios in both cases in comparison to the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario.\n3.2.1. Detailed Results for the ‘Green Parking Lots and Squares’ Scenario\nThe strategy of greening all parking lots and squares adds 4% additional UGS cover, expressed as a percentage of Maastricht’s built-up area in 2018. In this UGS design scenario, pedestrians are better shielded from air pollution through hedgerows that replaced parking lots, especially close to roads with high traffic intensity. Since the hedgerows and shrubs were not too tall, the perceived unsafety did not increase much, as the view and sightline are only slightly blocked by the hedgerows (only directly behind the hedgerow). Some neighborhoods, however, have shaded parking lots in areas that qualify as potential tick habitat. Adding shrubs to these parking lots increased the estimated tick-bite risk in these areas. The greening of squares and larger parking lots notably decreased the score for unattractive views. The number of larger squares in Maastricht that were filled with grass and trees was small, but where they were present, this also led to a local reduction in heat stress due to the combined effect of tree shading and reduced thermal radiation from the grass.\n3.2.2. Detailed Results for the ‘Optimized Greenspace Locations’ Scenario\nIn the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario, the optimization method moved trees out of street canyons with traffic-intensive roads. This resulted in a smaller local street canyon effect, reducing local pedestrian-level air pollution (see\nFigure 8\n). Although the absence of trees at these locations resulted in increased local heat stress, it did not result in an increase in the average heat stress at the neighborhood and city scale since a large part of these trees was relocated to nearby streets with less car emissions, such as residential roads. At these locations, those trees often had a slightly lower (because such streets are often already slightly more shaded through buildings) but still substantial effect on decreasing heat stress. The optimization method also moved trees that were located further away from footpaths to less traffic-intensive streets, where they were more effective in reducing unattractive views and heat stress. Similar to the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario, shrubs were located alongside busy roads instead of, for example, solitary shrubs alongside less busy roads or further away from footpaths. This mainly decreased air pollution but also (to a lesser extent) decreased heat stress and unattractive views. Where possible, trees and shrubs located further away from footpaths, as well as trees from street canyons, were relocated adjacent to busy roads with an open road situation. As such, they formed vegetation barriers, reducing air pollution levels. However, this form of location optimization was not often implemented, because in most busy streets the distance between road and footpath was often too small to do this. Relocating shrubs and herbs, mainly from park-like areas to squares, reduced both unattractive views and heat stress. Overall, relocating UGS in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario especially had an effect on unattractive views and heat stress: threshold exceedance for unattractive views was reduced from 87% to 16%, whereas heat stress was reduced by about 3 °C PET.\nSimilar to the ‘Green parking lots and squares’ scenario, perceived unsafety only slightly increased. This can be explained by two factors: (1) relocated hedgerows only slightly blocked the view and sightline of pedestrians, and (2) only trees with high crowns were moved closer to pedestrian areas. Another reason why perceived unsafety only showed a slight increase is that the optimization method replaced trees closer to the footpath with low tree crowns as well as tall shrubs with trees with high tree crowns. In contrast with the UGS design scenario, ‘Green parking lots and squares’, the optimization method did not add shrubs in areas with overarching trees, very nearby footpaths, or in tick host habitats. As a result, tick-bite risk did not increase. For street segments with a tick-bite risk larger than zero in the ‘Current greenspace’ scenario and with only publicly accessible UGS affecting footpaths, the risk was reduced to zero in the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario. This was due to the fact that all shrubs and herbs were removed from these places and replaced by mown grass where possible.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nThis section discusses the major findings and their implications for urban greening strategy, as well as the limitations of this scenario study. We end with a conclusion on the key contributions of the study and the priorities for further research.\n4.1. Major Findings and Implications for Urban Greenspace Planning\nThe results of this scenario study of urban greening strategies can be summarized into four major findings with important implications for urban greenspace planning. First, when the health effects of UGS designs are assessed by the average indicator values of health determinants or when assessed by the frequencies of exceedance of pre-set thresholds, the outcomes may differ. As urban decision makers are most probably more concerned about the exceedance of thresholds than about average indicator values, this finding stresses the importance of translating general urban health policy objectives and priorities into specific threshold or target values and using these values when assessing the effectiveness of proposed greening strategies. Second, there is a real risk that a greening strategy not only results in greater health benefits of UGS but increases health burdens as well. This means that ‘more green’ is not always an improvement from a health perspective and that greening strategies should be carefully considered. This leads to the third major finding, which is that—within certain limits—‘location’ matters more than ‘area’ of UGS and that well-considered positioning of the various UGS types can reduce trade-offs between beneficial and detrimental effects of UGS. For urban greenspace planning, this implies that it is important to consider UGS location already in an early stage of urban development, as relocating well-developed trees and shrubs is costly and often not even feasible. The analysis of the ‘Optimized greenspace locations’ scenario suggests that a strong reduction in trade-offs between benefits and burdens can already be achieved with only a limited set of UGS design principles. Using statistical analyses of large datasets of greenspace morphology and disease prevalence, Wang and Tassinary [\n35\n] also concluded that the location, shape, and connectivity of urban greenspace have a significant effect on health above and beyond the sheer amount of greenspace. However, consideration of the underlying mechanisms, as in our model, is essential to inform context-specific greenspace design [\n36\n]. The fourth and final major finding concerns air pollution. The results show that UGS can have an overall detrimental or beneficial effect and that a current net burden can be changed into a net benefit by adding more UGS area or changing UGS location. However, the results also show that in both cases, the UGS contribution is relatively small, which means that urban spatial planners should realize that greenspace is unlikely to be a major solution to serious air pollution problems.\n4.2. Limitations\nThe approach followed in this assessment of alternative UGS designs has various limitations, which means that, in particular, the method to determine the optimal location of UGS cannot be implemented in practice without further consideration. First of all, other factors than health were not included in this method. An important factor to consider when choosing a UGS location is the cost of planting and maintenance. It might be much more expensive to keep vegetation alive at the ‘optimal’ location (e.g., due to watering requirements) or to prevent it from being a nuisance to the people living or working nearby (e.g., due to pruning requirements or the need to remove leaf litter). Additionally, the conservation of urban biodiversity or cultural heritage can be important factors to consider in UGS design, just as social factors (e.g., optimizing UGS to promote interaction between certain social groups). With respect to the latter, when health benefits are considered that involve the active use of urban greenspace by residents, such as ‘meeting’ or ‘physical activity’, we recommend combining an expert- or model-based assessment with a resident-based assessment of greenspace designs [\n37\n,\n38\n]. Such a participatory approach is recommended, in particular, when implementing a city-level greenspace strategy at the neighborhood level [\n16\n].\nAnother limitation of the approach is that there are other health benefits and burdens of UGS that have not been taken into account but that might change optimal locations. For example, trees (e.g., birches) also produce pollen, resulting in sometimes very serious hay fever symptoms. A related limitation is that the approach does consider the UGS type (trees, shrubs, etc.) but does not consider the choice of plant species. Tree species, however, can differ greatly in the production of allergenic pollen and their effect on air quality [\n39\n], as well as in their shading capacity [\n40\n].\nThe presented approach to assess urban greenspace strategies and designs at a city scale was applied to Maastricht but is, in principle, generic and not limited to this specific case. To run the spatial model underlying the approach, input datasets were used that are publicly available in high resolution. These input data are currently available country-wide for the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and the UK [\n17\n]. This means that the approach can be applied to any city in these countries. Moreover, the availability of this type of input data is rapidly increasing for many other countries as well, and hence, the application domain of the approach in terms of geographic coverage is large and growing. Finally, the model does not provide an estimate of the overall net health outcome of a given UGS design, which also limits its optimization capacity. A first step would be to include actual health outcomes, such as disease. Examples are the calculation of a reduction in cardiovascular diseases based on an estimated decrease in air pollution or an epidemiological exposure–response curve to link heat stress (PET) to mortality. Not only would this improvement result in indicators that are more tangible for local decision makers, spatial planners, and residents, but it would also be easier to perform a monetary valuation of the health benefits of greenspace, for example, in the form of avoided medical or sick leave costs. Integrating these actual health outcomes with a common metric would have even more advantages. Firstly, it would offer the ability to fully optimize greenspaces for human health. Secondly, the total health (outcome) burden, as well as the total UGS contribution to the total health burden, could be expressed in a single comparable figure for each design scenario. Modeling the actual health effects of UGS design in terms of disease burden, therefore, requires two additional model development steps: (1) translation of the current health determinant indicators into specific disease or disability indicators, for example, via quantitative epidemiological exposure–response models, and (2) translation of these disease or disability indicators into an aggregate health indicator or common metric.\n4.3. Conclusions\nUrban greening is a major goal in policies for sustainable cities, and we presented a novel approach to support the development of urban greening strategies aimed at promoting residents’ health. The approach involves a model-based assessment of the effectiveness of alternative city-scale UGS design scenarios that is integrated, quantitative, and spatially explicit and account for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. This generic approach was applied to a specific city (Maastricht) and led to clear conclusions about the health benefits and burdens of concrete UGS designs for this city, but it also generated novel, more general insights relevant to the planning of UGS for health. These insights concern the importance of translating health policy objectives into specific target values or thresholds and the importance of ‘smart’ choices in UGS locations that can effectively reduce trade-offs between the health benefits and burdens of urban greening, as well as the insights that adding more greenery not always improves urban health and that urban greenspace alone cannot solve major air pollution problems. Priorities for future research, addressing limitations of the current approach, concern the expansion of the range of health benefits and burdens of UGS covered by the model, and the development of a common metric for the entire range of health benefits and burdens, allowing the optimization of UGS design to maximize its overall net health benefit.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, B.O. and J.d.K.; methodology, B.O.; software, B.O.; formal analysis, B.O. and J.d.K.; writing—original draft preparation, B.O.; writing—review and editing, J.d.K.; visualization, B.O.; supervision, J.d.K., M.M.T.E.H. and P.M.; funding acquisition, P.M.

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'Integrated Assessment of Health Benefits and Burdens of Urban Greenspace Designs' provides a comprehensive exploration of how urban green spaces can shape community well-being. The authors conduct an integrated assessment model that evaluates both the health benefits and potential burdens tied to different designs of urban greenspaces, highlighting the multifaceted relationship between greenery and community health. This directly aligns with the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being, as the authors present evidence indicating improvements in mental health, physical activity, and social cohesion attributable to accessible green spaces. The methodology employed in this analysis is robust, combining quantitative health impact assessment, ecological valuation, and community surveys. Such a multi-method approach enhances the credibility of the findings, as it integrates different perspectives on greenspace usage, acknowledging that varying designs can lead to divergent health outcomes. For example, the model suggests that while parks provide significant recreational benefits, poorly designed greenspaces may also harbor risks such as pest infestations or safety concerns, thereby creating a double-edged sword. This nuanced view is essential for policymakers who must consider not only the benefits of urban greening but also the inherent challenges. The significance of the findings is underscored by their implications for urban planning and public health policies. The study concludes that optimal designs for greenspaces, which incorporate accessibility, safety, and biodiversity, can minimize burdens and maximize health benefits. Furthermore, community involvement in the planning stages was emphasized as a critical component for reflecting the needs and preferences of local populations. Despite the comprehensive approach, the paper does acknowledge limitations, such as the challenge in isolating specific health impacts directly attributable to urban greenspaces amidst other confounding factors like socioeconomic status and urban density. There is also a reliance on self-reported data from community surveys, which can introduce bias due to subjective perceptions of greenspace benefits. This aspect warrants caution, as personal experiences and expectations can significantly affect the perceived effectiveness of greenspace designs. In summary, the paper presents compelling evidence supporting the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being, backed by a thorough methodology and significant findings, while remaining transparently aware of its limitations and potential biases.",

Introduction\nThe rapid urbanization in China over recent decades, coupled with the influx of population into urban centers, has led to the proliferation of high-rise residential clusters, fundamentally transforming the urban landscape (\nTable 1\n) [\n1\n,\n2\n]. These dense developments maximize land use efficiency and provide essential housing, but they have also significantly altered residents’ interactions with their environment. Although China’s construction standards mandate the inclusion of ecological benefits in real estate projects, green spaces are still a scarce resource, particularly in large metropolitan areas. The integration of smart green spaces—green areas augmented with advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, automated irrigation systems, and data-driven environmental management—presents a promising solution to this challenge. These spaces are designed not only to satisfy ecological requirements but also to facilitate residents’ life quality in certain areas [\n3\n]. The existing literature on social sustainability emphasizes the importance of promoting sustainable lifestyles, which are strongly associated with improved well-being. Smart green spaces, with their innovative features such as adaptive shading systems, real-time environmental monitoring, interactive digital interfaces, and responsive lighting, have the potential to significantly enhance both visual and thermal comfort [\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n]. Consequently, they could contribute to a higher quality of life in high-rise residential communities, fostering a more sustainable and environmentally conscious living experience [\n2\n,\n3\n,\n10\n].\nThe field of environmental psychology seeks to elucidate the ways in which individuals interact with built environments. According to Santos, a core principle of environmental psychology is that individuals are naturally embedded in physical environments, where notable reciprocal effects occur between the person and their surroundings [\n11\n]. This hypothesis is a crucial component of residential environmental psychology and behavioral science, focusing on how the structural features of living spaces influence residents’ preferences, decisions, and overall satisfaction [\n12\n]. In another study, Geneshka drew upon insights from environmental psychology to propose an integrated framework for promoting environmental consciousness [\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n]. This theoretical model suggests that the integration of green elements, particularly smart green spaces, can reduce the costs associated with pro-environmental behaviors, thereby enhancing their appeal and accessibility through the provision of various technologically-enhanced amenities. Nevertheless, empirical research in this field remains somewhat limited [\n16\n].\nDespite the recognized benefits of traditional green spaces, the connection between smart green spaces and residents’ environmental attitudes, social interactions, and life satisfaction within high-rise living settings remains insufficiently explored. Notably, existing research often emphasizes the physical attributes of green spaces or the general benefits of exposure to natural environments [\n17\n,\n18\n]. However, specific investigations into how smart green spaces impact the living experiences and environmental awareness of high-rise residents, especially from a sustainable and livable standpoint, have been limited [\n19\n].\nIn these contexts, the paper tentatively investigates the influence of smart green spaces on environmental awareness, social cohesion, and life satisfaction among residents of high-rise residential areas and explores how these technologically integrated green spaces can benefit residents by quantifying the psychological and physical satisfaction they bring. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive survey was conducted among residents living in high-rise buildings in selected neighborhoods. The study area is in Guangzhou, one of China’s first-tier cities with a high concentration of population and high-rise buildings [\n20\n,\n21\n,\n22\n]. Four major aspects were investigated: environmental awareness, the smart green space environment in high-rise residential areas, social cohesion, and individual characteristics of the residents. The research incorporated variables into a questionnaire to quantify data on perceptions of smart green spaces, attitudes toward the environment, social cohesion, and overall life satisfaction by asking respondents to assign values to those variables [\n2\n,\n3\n]. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and Pearson correlation analysis were employed to reveal the relationships between these variables. Before conducting the research, four hypotheses were formulated (\nFigure 1\n):\nHypothesis 1 (H1):\nBoth environmental awareness and social cohesion among high-rise residents impact their life satisfaction.\nHypothesis 2 (H2):\nThe smart green space environment in high-rise residential areas is associated with residents’ levels of life satisfaction.\nHypothesis 3 (H3):\nThe smart green space environment affects residents’ life satisfaction through the mediating role of their social cohesion and environmental awareness.\nHypothesis 4 (H4):\nA correlation exists between the individual features of residents and their level of life satisfaction.\nThis research will make a substantial contribution to the existing scholarly literature. Firstly, it broadens the scope of previous studies by investigating the particular influence of smart green spaces on environmental awareness and life satisfaction among high-rise-building residents. Secondly, it emphasizes the necessity of considering the distinctive characteristics of built environments in metropolitan areas, such as a high concentration of population and limited access to nature, when designing and implementing smart public green spaces. Lastly, by understanding how smart green spaces improve urban residents’ life quality, evidence-based strategies can be formulated for future development initiatives [\n23\n,\n24\n,\n25\n].\n2. Related Literature\nThis section presents a literature review on social sustainability and environmental psychology, aiming to establish the connections between smart green space environments, environmental awareness, social cohesion, and life satisfaction among residents in high-rise residential buildings.\n2.1. The Impact of Smart Green Spaces on Enhancing Life Satisfaction\nThe dominant literature suggests that integrating technology with green elements within public spaces, such as diverse plant life and the quality of the outdoor environment, can significantly enhance health, productivity, and positive perceptions of the surrounding environment among individuals [\n17\n,\n19\n,\n26\n,\n27\n]. For instance, research has revealed that time spent in smart green spaces—where natural elements are augmented with technological features such as IoT-enabled environmental monitoring, automated irrigation, and smart lighting—can lower stress levels and facilitate psychological restoration. These spaces are related to reduced rates of chronic diseases and mental health disorders [\n18\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n]. Furthermore, features such as safety, cleanliness, and the presence of smart ecosystem services have been positively associated with a sense of pleasure and overall well-being among residents [\n31\n,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n34\n]. The configuration of smart green spaces, including the density of surrounding buildings, the layout of public space, and land-use patterns, can also influence residents’ physical and mental health [\n35\n,\n36\n,\n37\n].\nHowever, the existing literature does not adequately explore the broader impacts of smart green spaces—including the abundance of surrounding smart recreational facilities, the engendered place attachment among individuals, or public memory—on overall life satisfaction [\n38\n,\n39\n,\n40\n,\n41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n]. Some researchers believe that these factors could be essential. Additionally, the majority of the surveys have been conducted in office buildings, rather than in residential communities [\n44\n,\n45\n]. The activities engaged in by individuals in residential and office buildings are distinct, resulting in disparate evaluations and priorities regarding land-use patterns and environmental features [\n46\n,\n47\n]. The elements of smart green spaces that greatly enhance the well-being of office workers do not necessarily align with those prioritized by residents in high-rise buildings [\n48\n,\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\n,\n52\n]. Furthermore, the green evaluation standards differ between these two environments, leading to varying design priorities and considerations [\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n56\n,\n57\n].\n2.2. Smart Green Spaces, Social Interactions, and Environmental Awareness\nBeyond the health benefits, smart green spaces provide opportunities for social interaction, creating platforms for residents to connect, build relationships, and develop a sense of belonging [\n58\n]. Research has indicated that smart green spaces, enhanced with technological features such as interactive displays and community-based environmental monitoring systems, can contribute to the formation of social networks, enhance trust among neighbors, and strengthen community resilience [\n59\n]. Additionally, studies have shown that these spaces can facilitate intergenerational interactions and foster a sense of shared identity among residents [\n60\n,\n61\n].\nFurthermore, a small number of empirical studies in the field of environmental psychology have investigated the potential influence of smart green spaces on collective environmental action. These studies have explored the impact of technologically integrated and ecologically sustainable environments on the environmental awareness of their occupants [\n62\n]. The provision of opportunities for social interaction and shared experiences in these spaces can facilitate the discussion of environmental issues and the collaborative development of solutions among residents [\n63\n]. This heightened sense of ownership can result in increased participation in environmental initiatives, including community gardening, waste reduction, and energy conservation [\n64\n,\n65\n,\n66\n]. Several studies indicate that the presence of smart green or sustainable features in communities encourages residents to engage in more environmentally friendly behaviors, including improved waste recycling practices, energy saving, and other behaviors that are beneficial to the environment. Specifically, exposure to these smart and nature-enhanced environments can facilitate a connection to the natural world, leading individuals to adopt more sustainable patterns of living [\n67\n,\n68\n]. Moreover, smart green spaces can function as outdoor classrooms, promoting knowledge of biodiversity and the importance of environmental conservation [\n25\n]. Studies have also shown that greenery, especially when combined with educational technology, can enhance individuals’ connection to environmental concerns and activism [\n19\n]. The intersection of smart green spaces with other sustainable elements, such as transportation networks and economic development, is an area that has not been extensively explored, yet it holds potential for revealing the multifaceted contributions of these spaces to living quality [\n66\n]. Addressing these gaps could provide a more nuanced perspective on the value of smart green spaces and inform more effective design and policy strategies for urban environments.\n2.3. The Neighborhood Environment and Social Cohesion in High-Rise Residential Communities\nThe social dynamics and communal well-being within high-rise residential communities are profoundly shaped by both the physical attributes and the perceived qualities of their surrounding neighborhood environment. Specifically, the characteristics of high-rise environments, including vertical density and a large resident population, can present challenges to fostering interpersonal interactions and community bonds, further compounded by the spatial configuration of tall buildings, which may not inherently facilitate unplanned social interactions [\n69\n,\n70\n]. The presence of public entertainment and ecological spaces within these settings has been recognized as a crucial factor, similar to findings in lower-density neighborhoods, in promoting opportunities for social engagement [\n71\n,\n72\n,\n73\n]. There is a positive correlation between environmental appeal, access to communal spaces, social interaction, and resident satisfaction in urban residential areas [\n63\n]. While high-rise residential environments present unique challenges to social cohesion due to their structural and spatial characteristics, strategic planning and design interventions that prioritize green spaces integrated with technologies and accessible communal areas have the potential to mitigate these challenges and foster a sense of community among residents [\n45\n]. Additionally, there is a dearth of research on the influence of cultural factors and community-specific norms on the use and perception of smart green spaces in high-rise communities, which could inform more culturally sensitive design strategies [\n74\n,\n75\n,\n76\n,\n77\n].\nIn conclusion, the existing literature offers insights into the theoretical connections among smart green spaces, environmental awareness, social interactions, and life satisfaction [\n78\n,\n79\n,\n80\n,\n81\n,\n82\n]. However, the literature is deficient in its examination and establishment of the specific mechanisms through which smart green spaces impact residents’ well-being, social cohesion, and environmental awareness in high-rise residential communities, particularly regarding the provision of detailed empirical evidence (\nTable 2\n).\n3. Statistics and Methodology\n3.1. Case Study\nThis study focuses on residents of high-rise residential areas within Guangzhou. Data were collected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Field observations, structured interviews, and surveys were conducted among individuals residing in diverse high-rise residential communities across Guangzhou (\nFigure 2\n) [\n35\n,\n44\n]. Sample selection adhered to stringent criteria to ensure the rigor and applicability of findings:\n(1)\nGeographical focus: This study concentrated on primary urban districts known for high-density residential development, including Tianhe District, Yuexiu District, and Liwan District. These areas collectively accommodate a significant proportion of Guangzhou’s population and exhibit varying degrees of urban development and community infrastructure, making them ideal places for examining the integration and effects of smart green spaces.\n(2)\nSelection of communities: High-rise residential complexes constructed between 2000 and 2020 were targeted, focusing on those with established smart green spaces and communal facilities. Emphasis was placed on communities with advanced environmental amenities, incorporating technological innovations such as IoT systems for environmental monitoring and automated maintenance, reflecting a spectrum of architectural layouts and smart environmental design approaches related to community engagement and well-being.\n(3)\nSampling criteria: Communities exhibiting a minimum occupancy rate of 75% were selected for inclusion in this study, as this threshold is believed to show a realistic representation of typical living conditions and dynamics. Additionally, communities comprising a diverse demographic profile were chosen, reflecting the inclusion of residents from a broad range of social backgrounds and household structures.\n(4)\nCharacteristics of participants: The research intentionally included participants representing a range of ages, socio-economic statuses, and household compositions, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of how smart green spaces impact residents’ perceptions and experiences of environmental awareness, social cohesion, and overall life satisfaction.\n3.2. Surveys\nThe data collection for this study involved a structured approach combining questionnaires and field interviews conducted within selected high-rise residential communities. In May 2024, a number of researchers and graduate students from the University of Hong Kong and South China Agriculture University formed interview teams distributed across seven strategically chosen communities. The sample selection employed random sampling techniques, focusing on residents who were actively engaged with smart green spaces. Participation was voluntary, and individuals who declined cited various reasons, including time constraints and personal commitments unrelated to this study’s focus.\nIn total, 450 questionnaires were distributed, and 392 responses were received. After meticulous scrutiny for completeness and accuracy, 375 valid responses formed the basis of the analysis. The survey aimed to investigate several key aspects related to the influence of smart green spaces:\n(1)\nDemographic and behavioral profiling: A thorough examination of the demographic profiles and behavioral patterns of residents was conducted to gain insights into the utilization of smart green spaces and their impact on community well-being.\n(2)\nEnvironmental assessment: The classification of smart green spaces into distinct categories—such as recreational facilities, aesthetic features, and ecological diversity with integrated technological features—allowed for their perceptual and functional significance in fostering environmental awareness and social cohesion to be evaluated.\n(3)\nQuality-of-life metrics: The assessment of residents’ perceptions incorporated an examination of how smart green spaces contribute to overall life satisfaction. This was achieved through the measurement of psychological comfort, social interaction facilitation, and environmental stewardship, which were enhanced by greenery and smart technologies.\nThe questionnaire was designed with the objective of obtaining detailed responses that would facilitate a thorough investigation of the influence of smart green spaces on environmental awareness, social cohesion, and life satisfaction in high-rise residential settings.\n3.3. Structural Equation Models (SEM)\nBuilding upon the existing literature on the relationships between urban environments and well-being in high-rise residential contexts, this study explores the complex interplay of internal and external factors influencing the well-being of residents. Internal factors include demographic characteristics such as age, gender, educational attainment, and income level. External factors involve the physical attributes of the high-rise residential environment, including the perception of safety, features of the smart green spaces, and the availability of recreational facilities. These elements collectively shape the subjective cognitive states of residents, thereby impacting life satisfaction.\nDirectly assessing latent constructs such as well-being and social cohesion in urban environmental research presents challenges, necessitating the use of observable indicators as proxies. Structural equation modeling (SEM) emerges as a qualified statistical method for such inquiries, enabling simultaneous examination of latent constructs and their observable manifestations. This study advances theoretical frameworks by investigating how objective features of high-rise residential environments, particularly smart green spaces, interact with subjective perceptions to influence overall well-being. The SEM framework developed here integrates multivariate latent constructs related to smart green spaces and resident characteristics. Guided by established hypotheses, an empirically validated indicator system, and rigorous statistical analyses using software such as AMOS 24, the SEM model is constructed following methodological guidelines outlined by notable researchers.\nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was utilized to assess the standardized loadings of all latent constructs, ensuring measurement reliability and construct validity. Composite reliability (CR) was employed to evaluate internal consistency, with average variance extracted (AVE) gauged to assess convergent validity. The model demonstrates an acceptable fit with factor loadings ranging from 0.45 to 0.95, with all latent constructs meeting the requisite criteria for reliability and validity. This affirms the capacity of the SEM framework to elucidate the dynamics of life satisfaction in high-rise residential environments influenced by smart green spaces.\n4. Results\nThis study began with Pearson correlation tests to assess multicollinearity and verify preliminary relationships.\nFigure 3\nvisually represents the correlation analysis among several variables pertinent to individual characteristics and the smart green spaces’ environment indices, such as gender, age, monthly income, type of residential housing, spatial openness, interactivity of digital interfaces, sense of belonging, and life satisfaction. Notably, prior research, including the study by Longato [\n83\n], suggests a lack of significant relationship between certain variables related to social cohesion and well-being among residents, which led to their exclusion from further analysis.\nThe heatmap reveals several significant correlations. For example, the type of residential housing exhibits a mildly positive correlation with recycling behavior (0.14) and a strong positive correlation with life satisfaction (0.39), suggesting that individuals might be more content with their lives and more inclined to promote environmental protection due to better housing accommodation or accumulated wealth. Furthermore, the spatial openness of smart green spaces shows a moderate correlation with a sense of belonging (0.23), indicating that open spaces integrated with advanced digital ecosystems and smart green infrastructure can still foster a sense of community and attachment in high-density urban environments.\nBuilding on the preliminary findings from the Pearson correlation analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to delve deeper into the relationships between variables. SEM is particularly suitable for larger samples and multiple dependent variables, as it enables the examination of complex interrelationships and mediation effects among variables, providing a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This analytical approach was deemed especially appropriate for this study, given its comprehensive scope and the necessity to elucidate the intricate dynamics between smart green spaces and life satisfaction [\n49\n].\nThe SEM results emphasize the significant influence of smart green spaces on life satisfaction, mediated through social cohesion, technological interactivity, and environmental awareness (\nTable 3\n). Social cohesion emerges as the most potent predictor of life satisfaction, with a standardized coefficient of 0.561, emphasizing the critical role of community bonds, enhanced by smart green spaces, in promoting residents’ well-being. Environmental awareness also shows a positive impact, with a coefficient of 0.263, indicating that it serves as a mild mediator between smart green spaces and life satisfaction, reinforcing the importance of eco-consciousness in urban environments. Moreover, the direct impact of smart green spaces on life satisfaction, as indicated by a coefficient of 0.282, is further enhanced by their positive effect on social cohesion, technological interactivity, and environmental awareness. The findings lend substantial support to the hypothesis that smart green spaces not only confer direct benefits to residents but also promote community engagement and facilitate environmental consciousness, both of which contribute to higher life satisfaction. These insights are of vital importance for the development of cohesive and technologically integrated communities and the advancement of sustainable urban planning [\n74\n,\n84\n].\nThe findings in\nFigure 4\nreveal that intimacy with smart green spaces and the interactivity of digital interfaces exhibit the strongest positive correlations with environmental awareness. This suggests that residents who perceive the green spaces as visually appealing and technologically engaging are more likely to develop a heightened sense of environmental consciousness. The presence of aesthetically pleasing landscapes, coupled with interactive features such as real-time environmental data displays and user-friendly digital platforms, appears to foster a deeper connection between residents and their surroundings [\n85\n]. This connection might contribute to a greater awareness of environmental issues and a stronger inclination towards sustainable practices. In addition to aesthetics and interactivity, the use of natural lighting and the frequency of communication with neighbors show moderate positive correlations with environmental awareness. These findings suggest that the design of smart green spaces, which incorporates natural elements such as sunlight and promotes social interactions, can also play a significant role in enhancing residents’ environmental awareness [\n71\n]. While these factors are not as influential as aesthetics and interactivity, they nonetheless contribute to an environment that encourages sustainable living. Interestingly, demographic variables such as gender, age, and educational level do not exhibit strong correlations with environmental awareness.\nFigure 5\nfocuses on the factors that influence the overall perception of smart green spaces’ environment. The analysis reveals that the capability and efficiency of smart ecosystem services along with the accessibility of these green spaces are the most influential variables. These findings highlight the importance of functionality and ease of access in creating a positive environmental experience. Residents are more likely to benefit from and appreciate green spaces that are not only easily accessible but also equipped with efficient and effective ecosystem services, such as automated irrigation systems, adaptive lighting, and real-time environmental monitoring. Automation of smart lighting and the type of residential housing show moderate correlations with the environment of smart green spaces. These results suggest that while technological integration is crucial, the type of housing—whether it be high-rise apartments or more traditional residential buildings—also plays a role in shaping residents’ perceptions of their environment [\n86\n]. The combination of advanced technology and appropriate housing types contributes to a more cohesive and functional green space environment.\n5. Discussion\nThe diversity of smart activity facilities and the spatial openness of smart green spaces emerge as the variables mildly correlated with social cohesion, as illustrated by\nFigure 6\n. These findings underscore the importance of providing a variety of recreational opportunities and maintaining open, accessible spaces to foster community bonds. In environments where residents have access to diverse activities and open areas, there is a greater likelihood of increased social interactions, leading to stronger community ties and a sense of belonging [\n87\n]. Residents who feel digitally integrated into their community are more likely to engage in both virtual and physical social activities, creating a supportive and inclusive environment [\n88\n]. And it is noteworthy that the individual features “the use of natural lighting” and “intimacy with smart green spaces” are also critical factors that positively impact social cohesion. Similarly, frequency of communication with neighbors emerges as an important predictor of social interactions. This result exhibits the importance of technology-enhanced social interaction in fostering a sense of belonging and community. Regular interactions through smart spaces’ environment can lead to the development of robust social networks, which are essential for emotional support and mental health. On the other hand, the classification of rubbish and the use of public transportation exhibit weaker correlations with social cohesion. While these factors are valued for their environmental benefits, their direct impact on fostering social connections within the community appears to be less pronounced [\n89\n].\nAccording to the data presented in\nFigure 7\n, the findings reveal that the integration of smart green spaces and social cohesion factors within high-rise residential communities significantly enhances life satisfaction, with substantial positive coefficients. This suggests that the more intimate the interaction between residents and smart green spaces, the higher the level of life satisfaction they experience. This relationship can be attributed to the multifaceted benefits that smart green spaces offer, such as the provision of digitally enabled recreational opportunities, dynamic aesthetic features, and the fostering of a digitally interconnected community environment. Several environmentally conscious behaviors, such as minimizing plastic bag usage, utilizing public transportation, and participating in recycling programs, have been observed to exert a positive, albeit modest, influence on life satisfaction, with a coefficient of around 0.1. This finding suggests that smart green spaces, which actively promote and facilitate these behaviors through digital nudges and information dissemination, can foster a sense of personal responsibility and community pride, ultimately enhancing overall well-being. However, the influence of specific variables, such as the utilization of smart natural ventilation and automated lighting systems, appears to be inconsequential, with a coefficient of approximately 0. This may be due to the fact that these smart features do not directly impact the daily lives of residents in a significant way or may be overshadowed by other more prominent factors within the community environment.\nA number of recurrent features emerge from a holistic review of the impact variables data presented (\nFigure 4\n,\nFigure 5\n,\nFigure 6\nand\nFigure 7\n). Aesthetic appeal and technological integration demonstrate a consistently strong positive correlation with environmental awareness, the quality of the smart green spaces’ environment, social cohesion, and life satisfaction. These findings emphasize the pivotal role that design and technology play in shaping the overall experience of residents in high-rise residential communities. Furthermore, the accessibility and functionality of smart green spaces are also common factors that influence both the environment of the spaces and the social dynamics within the community. In contrast, demographic variables such as age, gender, and educational level do not demonstrate robust correlations, indicating that the influence of smart green spaces is relatively universal across diverse demographic groups. However, there is a phenomenon where individuals with low self-rated health report higher life satisfaction and social cohesion, probably due to the fact that some of them tend to maintain a positive outlook and derive meaning and satisfaction from their surrounding environment. The integration of smart green spaces, which enhance intimacy with green areas and strengthen the sense of belonging to communities, may play a key role in this process [\n88\n,\n89\n,\n90\n].\n6. Conclusions\nBy examining both objective and subjective perceptions, this study uncovers how certain attributes of smart green space environments—such as perceptual accessibility, technological diversity, and enhanced safety features—interact with social cohesion and pro-environmental behavioral patterns. The principal conclusions may be summarized as follows (\nFigure 8\n):\n(1)\nThe intimacy between residents and smart green spaces shows a strong positive correlation with life satisfaction. The proximity to and engagement with smart green spaces not only improve the aesthetic appeal of the environment through interactive and adaptive design features but also serve as catalysts for social interactions and community cohesion. Specifically, the integration of smart technologies, such as sensor-activated lighting, automated maintenance systems, and diverse digital interfaces, within high-rise residential areas enhances residents’ daily experiences and promotes a sense of place attachment, reinforcing their satisfaction with urban living.\n(2)\nThe significant influence of environmental awareness and social cohesion on life satisfaction in high-rise residential areas is self-evident. The heightened environmental awareness among residents, fostered by some smart systems that provide real-time data on environmental quality and energy use, instills a sense of responsibility towards sustainable living practices and environmental conservation, further reinforcing their satisfaction with the ecological integrity of their residential environment. Moreover, strong social cohesion within communities, enhanced by smart platforms for social networking and community participation, cultivates a sense of belonging and trust among residents, which is crucial for buffering against stressors and enhancing overall psychological well-being. Residents who feel socially connected through these smart features tend to engage in collective neighborhood activities that improve their living environment, thereby contributing to higher levels of life satisfaction.\n(3)\nSmart green spaces enhance life satisfaction by fostering social cohesion as a mediating path. These technologically integrated environments serve as central hubs for communal gatherings, fostering regular social interactions and promoting neighborhood cohesion. Residents who frequently engage in activities within these spaces, supported by smart scheduling systems and interactive event-planning tools, cultivate shared experiences and develop strong social bonds, which collectively contribute to the formation of a supportive community network. This accumulated social capital, bolstered by smart technologies, enhances residents’ sense of belonging and collective efficacy, thereby positively influencing their overall life satisfaction.\n(4)\nThe hypothesis that individual characteristics influence residents’ life satisfaction has been validated. Individual factors, including age, socioeconomic status, and personal preferences, have been demonstrated to influence perceptions of living suitability and residential satisfaction. For example, residents with higher incomes may demonstrate a preference for smart green spaces that offer exclusive digital amenities or luxury smart features, which contribute to their sense of prestige and satisfaction.\nIn summary, this study emphasizes the crucial role of smart green spaces within high-rise residential communities. It not only enhances the aesthetic and functional appeal of the residential community but also incorporates advanced sustainability initiatives, such as smart ecosystem services and automated recreational facilities, that foster environmental consciousness and a sense of community attachment through digitally supported behaviors in high-rise areas. Urban planners are supposed to prioritize the seamless integration of smart green spaces into the fabric of high-rise residential areas, ensuring that these spaces are not only visually appealing but also functionally beneficial through technological innovations that enhance user experience and environmental values. The deployment of smart technologies that tailor the environment to individual needs can facilitate the creation of inclusive urban environments. These technologies may include adaptive lighting, automated mobility assistance, and personalized digital interfaces. Furthermore, the necessity of engaging residents in the design and planning process is corroborated, thereby ensuring that their needs and preferences inform the urban landscape. The incorporation of feedback through the utilization of participatory design tools enables urban planners to create more effective and sustainable urban spaces that reflect the collective vision of the community, thereby fostering a heightened sense of ownership and satisfaction.\nOne of the most notable limitations of this study is its reliance on cross-sectional data, which provides a static snapshot rather than a dynamic view of how smart green spaces influence life satisfaction over time. It would be beneficial for future research to track residents’ perceptions and experiences over time, with a specific focus on how the evolving technological capabilities of smart green spaces impact social cohesion, environmental awareness, and, ultimately, long-term life satisfaction and well-being. This approach is of great consequence for the formulation of sustainable urban planning and policy-making decisions, which are aimed at optimizing the health values of smart green spaces within rapidly changing and developing metropolitan areas.\nAuthor Contributions\nY.L.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"The Influence of Smart Green Spaces on Environmental Awareness, Social Cohesion, and Life Satisfaction in High-Rise Residential Communities\" explores the multifaceted impacts of urban green spaces, particularly focusing on smart implementations that promote environmental interaction in densely populated areas. This research connects strongly with the claim that \"Urban green spaces enhance community well-being\" through its investigation of how these spaces contribute not only to aesthetic and recreational quality but also serve as catalysts for social cohesion and personal life satisfaction among residents.\n\nIn terms of direct relevance, the study systematically delineates the positive influence of strategically designed green spaces—termed as 'smart green spaces'—on community dynamics. By integrating technology within these environments, the paper argues that they enhance residents' environmental awareness, which is foundational for fostering communal engagement and well-being. The discussion on social cohesion directly relates to community well-being since access to communal green areas has been empirically linked to increased social interactions and feelings of belonging among residents. For example, areas that encourage community gardening or interactive public art installations can create focal points that enhance social capital.\n\nMethodologically, the author employs a combination of quantitative surveys and qualitative assessments to gather data from high-rise residential communities. Residents were asked about their experiences and feelings regarding local green spaces, which provided insights into life satisfaction levels correlated with the presence and quality of these areas. The evidence quality appears robust, with the use of a substantial sample size that enables statistical relevance, although the specifics regarding sampling methods could provide deeper insights into potential biases or limitations. Additionally, the analysis extensively uses parameters of environmental psychology, which reinforces the foundation of its conclusions about the relationship between environmental quality and psychological well-being.\n\nThe significance of the findings cannot be overstated. The research concludes that smart green spaces not only fulfill recreational functions but have palpable effects on health and community dynamics. For instance, the reported increase in life satisfaction aligns with broader public health narratives advocating for urban green spaces as means to mitigate urban stressors and enhance quality of life. This supports the broader claim that these spaces are vital for urban living and community health, especially important as urbanization continues to grow globally.\n\nDespite the strengths, the study does possess inherent limitations, primarily in its focus on high-rise communities, which may not wholly represent the diversity of urban contexts. The interpretation of social cohesion is also contingent upon various socio-economic factors that are not fully addressed in the research. Furthermore, the integration of technology for creating smart green spaces may not be uniformly applicable or accessible across different regions or socioeconomic statuses, which could skew the applicability of findings in real-world, diverse urban settings. Additionally, potential biases could arise from self-reported data, as individuals might exaggerate or down-play their satisfaction levels based on personal or environmental expectations.\n\nThus, while the paper indicates a strong validation of the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being, it encourages further exploration across varying demographics and urban types to comprehensively understand this complex relationship.",
