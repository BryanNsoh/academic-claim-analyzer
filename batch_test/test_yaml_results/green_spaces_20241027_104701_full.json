Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

The scarcity of parks and natural environments in densely populated cities contributes to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and diminished well-being. Our project proposes developing rooftop parks and gardens to address these issues, transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. The project begins by identifying suitable rooftops for park and garden development. This involves assessing structural integrity, accessibility, and potential community needs. Once appropriate sites are identified, the project moves into the design and construction phase, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The resulting rooftop parks will provide relaxation, recreation, and social interaction spaces.  Community engagement is a critical component of this project. By involving residents from the outset, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and ensure that the rooftop parks meet the community's specific needs. Activities include: • Training local volunteers to maintain the green spaces. • Organizing events to promote awareness. • Creating community-led groups to manage the parks' ongoing maintenance. The benefits of rooftop parks are significant. These green spaces offer urban residents a much-needed escape from city life, providing areas for exercise, relaxation, and social gatherings. The project also seeks to raise awareness about environmental sustainability by integrating educational programs and community activities that promote eco-friendly practices.  The community-driven approach fosters social cohesion and resilience, encouraging collaboration among residents. By involving the community in every project stage, from planning to maintenance, we aim to create a long-lasting impact on urban health and well-being.  Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the quality of life for urban residents, strengthen community ties, and contribute to creating more resilient and sustainable cities. By providing accessible green spaces in urban settings, this project represents a crucial step in addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and its impact on public health and community well-being.    2  SECTION 3: DETAILED PROJECT INFORMATION  1. Problem Statement:  Urban environments often suffer from a significant lack of accessible green spaces, leading to numerous health risks and exacerbating broader humanitarian issues. This scarcity contributes to physical health concerns such as heat-related illnesses, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, it triggers a rise in mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and social isolation (Geary et al., 2023). The limited availability of green spaces restricts opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, which are essential for the well-being of urban residents. The broader impact of this problem extends beyond individual health, affecting community resilience and environmental sustainability. Green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating environmental risks, such as air pollution and the urban heat island effect. They also offer a natural refuge from the stresses of urban life, providing a setting where residents can engage in outdoor activities or simply unwind from the pressures of city living. Despite their importance, millions of people in densely populated cities worldwide face limited access to parks and other green areas, impacting their quality of life and contributing to social inequalities. Research in reputable journals like The Lancet and Environmental Health Perspectives has established a strong link between green spaces and reduced rates of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and various mental health disorders (Rojas-Rueda et al. , 2016). Green spaces can also positively influence children's cognitive development and improve the overall quality of urban environments. Furthermore, global initiatives like the World Health Organization's Urban Green Spaces and Health program emphasize the role of green spaces in promoting public health and environmental quality (World Health Organization,2016). The lack of accessible green spaces also has significant social implications. The unequal distribution of parks and recreational areas often leaves marginalized communities without access to these vital resources, reinforcing existing social disparities. This unequal access undermines environmental sustainability, as green spaces are critical for regulating temperatures, reducing pollution, and promoting biodiversity. The absence of green spaces diminishes environmental quality and increases cities' vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Moreover, the lack of green spaces contributes to increased social isolation, particularly among older adults and children. This issue disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where access to green spaces is often more limited. The result is a cycle of health, social, and environmental inequity that perpetuates itself over time. Addressing the shortage of green spaces in urban areas is crucial for promoting social justice, human rights, and sustainable development. It aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to health, sustainable cities, and climate action. A community-based approach to developing and preserving green spaces can contribute to social cohesion and strengthen urban resilience. It can also create new economic opportunities through community-led initiatives and support efforts to tackle climate change. By prioritizing equitable access to green spaces, cities can foster a sense of community and improve public health outcomes. Addressing this shortage allows for greater inclusivity, ensuring that all residents can 3  benefit from nature's physical, mental, and social advantages within urban settings. Ultimately, green spaces should be viewed not just as amenities but as essential components of a healthy and sustainable urban infrastructure. Addressing this issue holistically not only improves individual health outcomes but also builds stronger, more inclusive communities capable of withstanding socio-economic and environmental stressors.    2. Description of the Solution:  Rooftop parks and gardens offer an innovative solution to the growing problem of limited green spaces in urban areas. As cities become increasingly crowded, these green areas effectively use underutilized rooftop spaces, providing accessible nature and recreational areas within dense urban landscapes. This approach addresses several critical issues simultaneously, fostering environmental sustainability, enhancing social cohesion, and stimulating economic growth. The concept of rooftop parks and gardens is rooted in the efficient use of existing infrastructure, a critical consideration in cities where available land is scarce and development pressures are high. By repurposing rooftops, we can create green spaces that serve multiple functions, from improving air quality to providing community gathering spaces. This innovative approach reduces the need to acquire additional land for green spaces, allowing cities to maintain their density while offering residents much-needed areas for recreation and relaxation.  Environmental Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens contribute significantly to environmental sustainability. These green spaces act as \"green lungs\" within the concrete jungle, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They also help mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing natural cooling, which is crucial as global temperatures rise and cities become warmer. Rooftop greenery can reduce energy consumption by providing natural insulation, leading to lower heating and cooling costs for buildings. This, in turn, can reduce the overall carbon footprint of urban areas.  Additionally, rooftop parks and gardens contribute to improved water management in cities. They can act as natural rainwater catchment systems, reducing runoff and easing pressure on urban drainage systems. This helps to prevent flooding and promotes groundwater recharge, contributing to a more sustainable urban water cycle. Rooftop gardens can also support biodiversity by providing birds, insects, and other wildlife habitats in an otherwise sterile urban environment. This biodiversity aspect is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems within cities.  Social Benefits Beyond environmental sustainability, rooftop parks and gardens offer significant social benefits. Studies have shown that access to green spaces can improve mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. These spaces provide a respite from the noise and congestion of urban life, allowing residents to relax and connect with nature. Rooftop parks and gardens also serve as communal gathering spots, fostering social interaction and strengthening community bonds. These green spaces are precious in cities where social isolation is a growing concern. By creating environments that encourage people to come together, rooftop parks and gardens can help combat loneliness and promote a sense of belonging. They can also promote physical activity, as they offer spaces for exercise and recreation. This is particularly important in urban areas where traditional parks and open spaces are inaccessible. 4   Furthermore, rooftop parks and gardens can help bridge social divides by providing inclusive spaces where people from diverse backgrounds can meet and interact. This can foster greater understanding and tolerance among different groups, creating a more cohesive and harmonious urban community.  Economic Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens also offer significant economic benefits. They can enhance property values, making them an attractive feature for real estate development. A study by the National Association of Realtors found that proximity to parks and green spaces can increase property values by up to 20%. This increase in property values can increase cities' tax revenue, providing additional funding for public services and infrastructure.  Moreover, rooftop parks and gardens can create employment opportunities in construction and ongoing maintenance. This can stimulate local economies and provide landscaping, gardening, and park management jobs. These employment opportunities can be particularly beneficial in urban areas with high unemployment rates, offering a pathway for economic development and revitalization. Rooftop parks and gardens can also support local businesses by attracting visitors and encouraging foot traffic in urban areas. These green spaces can become popular destinations, drawing people from across the city and creating opportunities for retail and service businesses nearby. This can lead to a more vibrant urban economy and a higher quality of life for residents.  Theory of Change The theory of change underlying the adoption of rooftop parks and gardens revolves around their capacity to catalyze positive transformations across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By converting rooftops into green spaces, we can anticipate tangible improvements in air quality, urban heat island mitigation, and biodiversity conservation, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals.  Socially, these spaces can foster community cohesion, promote physical and mental well-being, and provide inclusive areas for recreational activities and social interaction. The sense of community that rooftop parks and gardens foster can strengthen urban resilience and support efforts to build more inclusive and equitable cities.  Rooftop parks and gardens offer a holistic solution to the problem of limited green spaces in urban areas by addressing environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and economic development. This innovative approach can lead to more resilient, inclusive, and livable cities that prioritize the well-being of their residents while promoting sustainable development goals.            5  3. Program Design and Implementation Plan:  The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program is a comprehensive initiative to enhance public health and well-being in urban areas by transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. This program addresses the growing issue of limited green spaces in cities, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. The overarching goal is to improve physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents by constructing rooftop parks, engaging communities through awareness programs, and providing educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The first step in implementing this program involves conducting a thorough needs assessment to identify rooftops suitable for development. This step includes extensive surveys and consultations with property owners, local authorities, and community stakeholders to ensure that the rooftops meet structural and safety requirements. The needs assessment also gauges community support and confirms regulatory compliance. By selecting appropriate rooftops, the program provides its efforts to align with local building codes and address potential risks. Once the suitable rooftops are identified, the program moves into the design and planning phase, which involves creating detailed architectural and landscaping blueprints. This phase emphasizes safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. Collaborating with urban planners and landscape architects, the designs incorporate elements that support the program's goals while enhancing the visual appeal of the urban landscape. Following the design phase, the construction of the rooftop parks and gardens begins. This step involves preparing the rooftops, installing safety features, and constructing green spaces according to the approved plans. The program establishes clear timelines and milestones for construction, allowing for efficient project management. To ensure the longevity of the rooftop parks, a comprehensive maintenance plan is developed, involving community volunteers and local organizations to maintain the green spaces. Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the program's success. The program organizes various events and awareness campaigns to encourage community participation and foster a sense of ownership. Volunteer opportunities are created for the upkeep of the rooftop parks, and educational workshops on gardening and environmental practices are offered to promote sustainable behavior. This community-focused approach helps integrate the rooftop parks into the urban culture, turning them into valued assets. To mitigate potential problems, the program implements several vital strategies. Diverse funding sources are secured to ensure financial stability, while close collaboration with local authorities helps navigate regulatory challenges. The program also uses weather-resistant materials and adjusts construction timelines to accommodate adverse weather conditions. Extensive community outreach and education efforts are made to reduce resistance and build strong support for the program. Robust evaluation metrics are established to monitor the program's progress and success. These include indicators such as reported stress levels, surface temperatures, and the number of completed rooftop projects. These metrics provide a clear framework for assessing the program's impact and allow for timely adjustments to address any challenges during implementation. The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program aims to significantly improve public health and well-being in urban areas through a well-thought-out program design and a comprehensive implementation plan. By engaging the community 6  and addressing potential risks, the program creates sustainable and accessible green spaces that contribute to the overall resilience and quality of life in urban environments.

Evaluation Metrics and Methodology:  The methodology for evaluating the impact of the Rooftop Parks and Gardens program on urban health and well-being combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. A primary metric involves achieving a measurable reduction in self-reported stress levels among residents living near rooftop parks/gardens, assessed through pre- and post-intervention surveys. The evaluation methodology encompasses various indicators corresponding to the outcomes and outputs defined in the log frame. Below are the key indicators, measurement approaches, and SMART criteria that guide the evaluation process: Outcome Indicators 1. Improved physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents: • Indicator: Reduced reported stress levels among residents near established rooftop parks/gardens. • Measurement: Conduct pre- and post-intervention surveys to assess changes in self-reported stress levels. This data will help determine the program's effectiveness in enhancing residents' well-being. • SMART Criteria: Achieve a 20% reduction in self-reported stress levels among residents living near rooftop parks/gardens, demonstrating a tangible impact on urban health and well-being. 2. Lower urban heat island temperatures: • Indicator: Decrease in average surface temperatures in areas with rooftop parks/gardens by 2 degrees Celsius compared to surrounding urban areas. • Measurement: Use remote sensing technology, such as thermal imaging, to track surface temperatures before and after the program's implementation. The comparison of temperatures in areas with and without rooftop parks will help assess the program's cooling effects. • SMART Criteria: Achieve a 2 degrees Celsius reduction in average surface temperatures in areas with rooftop parks/gardens, indicating successful mitigation of the urban heat island effect. Output Indicators 1. Construction and establishment of rooftop parks/gardens: • Indicator: Number of rooftop park/garden projects completed. • Measurement: Maintain a detailed record of completed projects, including their locations, sizes, and opening dates. This data will clearly measure the program's progress toward its objectives. • SMART Criteria: Complete a predetermined number of rooftop park/garden projects within the designated timeframe, ensuring proper documentation and consistency with program plans. 2. Community engagement and awareness programs: • Indicator: Attendance at community events and level of community participation. • Measurement: Keep attendance records at community engagement events, such as workshops, information sessions, and volunteer activities. These figures will reflect the program's success in fostering community involvement. • SMART Criteria: Increase attendance at community engagement events through targeted promotion and maintain high participation rates, indicating robust community support and engagement.  8  Additional Considerations The program's evaluation strategy incorporates pre- and post-intervention surveys to measure changes in stress levels, remote sensing technology to track temperature variations, and attendance records for community engagement activities. These metrics ensure a comprehensive assessment of the program's impact and facilitate adjustments as needed to meet the program's goals. The success of the Rooftop Parks and Gardens program depends on solid stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance, and ongoing community support. To mitigate risks, the program has established mechanisms to ensure consistent funding, community outreach, and collaboration with local authorities. These steps will help address potential challenges and contribute to the program's overall success.   Citations:           B, K. (2023, December).

Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people.Maintaining functional and biodiverse urban green spaces is fundamental for liveable cities (cf. SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20.

Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2. Final most parsimonious SEM connecting garden management (land-use types, management intensity), urbanisation, plant and soil fauna diversity with soil multifunctionality (AICc = 288.3, Fisher’s C = 24.3, P = 0.93). Arrows represent unidirectional relationships among variables. Black arrows denote significantly (p < 0.05) positive and red arrows significantly negative relationships (Table 3). Dashed grey arrows represent non significant relationships (p > 0.05). The thickness of paths has been scaled based on the magnitude of the standardised regression coefficient. Conditional R2s, based on the variance of both the fixed and random effects, as well as marginal R2s, based on the fixed effect parts for each component models are given in the boxes of the response variables. Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

R2M is based on fixed effects and R2C on fixed and random (garden ID) effects. Total estimates of indirect pathways are given in Table S6.7Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/similar relationship of management intensity and decreased diversity has been observed in urban lawns. Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

        "abstract": "Urban heat poses significant challenges to public health, as exposure to high temperatures is associated to heat stress, resulting in heat strain, sleep deprivation, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As the frequency of heat waves is increasing due to global warming, urban green spaces are often proposed as a nature-based solution to mitigate urban heat stress. This study investigated the impact of urban green space on perceived heat stress and sleep quality, using questionnaires and detailed land cover data. We surveyed 584 respondents during four heat and four control events in the summers of 2021 and 2022, assessing perceived heat stress, sleep quality, and mental health. Using structural equation models, this study analysed the influence of both tree cover and grass and shrub cover on perceived heat stress and sleep quality, while controlling for risk and vulnerability factors. The outcomes revealed that during heat events, enhanced tree cover was associated with reduced heat stress (B = -0.484, 95% CI [-0.693, -0.275], p = 0.001), while increased grass and shrub cover was associated with both reduced heat stress (B = -0.361 [-0.529, -0.193], p = 0.000) and improved sleep quality (B = -0. 241 [-0.399, -0.083], p = 0.003). Conversely, during control events, stress indicators were more strongly associated with individual vulnerability factors rather than surrounding green space. These results emphasize the importance of combining trees with lower vegetation in urban planning to mitigate heat-related stress and enhance sleep quality, thereby improving overall well-being during heat events.",

Introduction\nUrban air pollution is a threat to human health. Air quality is generally worse in metropolitan areas due to high emissions from human activities [\n1\n]. A substantial portion of people live in cities where air quality limits are frequently exceeded, adversely affecting people’s quality of life. Particulate matter (PM\nx\n), nitrogen dioxide (NO\n2\n), and ground-level ozone (O\n3\n) are the most harmful pollutants to human health in Europe. For instance, in Italy, air pollution is approximately related to 62,000 deaths yearly [\n2\n].\nPM\nx\nis defined as a complex mixture of saturated solutions and solid substances, including heavy metals, unburned black carbon particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and other suspended constituents [\n3\n]. PM\nx\ncan originate from natural or anthropogenic processes, with fossil fuel combustion from vehicles, building heating, and industrial and agricultural activities being the primary sources in urban environments [\n4\n,\n5\n]. Atmospheric PM\nx\nis classified based on the diameter of its particles: PM\n10\n(≤10 µm), PM\n2.5\n(≤2.5 µm), and PM\n0.2\n(≤0.2 µm) [\n6\n], with its accumulation on leaves depending on particle properties. Most of the total particle number accumulated on leaves is smaller than 2.5 µm. These small particles are particularly harmful to human health, as they can penetrate the respiratory system, causing severe pulmonary conditions. Larger particles can absorb toxic materials due to their shape and size [\n7\n].\nUrban green reduces air pollution by capturing PM\nx\n[\n8\n], serving as biological barriers along roads, high-traffic avenues, and streets [\n9\n], providing an effective solution for reducing urban air pollution. Efforts have been made to estimate the amount of pollutants removed by plants globally. For example, one hectare of urban tree cover in the United States removes about 67 kg of pollution annually [\n10\n]. In Britain, it was estimated that natural urban green spaces removed 28,700 tonnes of pollutants (PM\n2.5\n, NO\n2\n, SO\n2\n, and O\n3\n) in 2015, resulting in 900 fewer respiratory hospital admissions, 220 fewer cardiovascular hospital admissions, 240 fewer deaths, and 3600 fewer Life Years Lost [\n8\n].\nParticle features such as size, shape, and composition influence the deposition mechanism on leaves and are crucial for predicting regional pollutant concentrations [\n11\n]. Understanding the impact of leaf morphology on PM\nx\naccumulation is essential for elucidating the differential capacities among species to facilitate PM\nx\ndeposition [\n12\n]. Selecting plant species to improve air quality at vulnerable urban sites is fundamental before planning and designing efficient pollution-mitigating interventions [\n13\n]. Additionally, site-specific conditions such as traffic density, the presence of buildings, atmospheric stability, and wind angle must be considered for the effectiveness of urban green projects in improving air quality [\n11\n].\nSeveral studies quantify PM\nx\naccumulation on leaves using different approaches. Two common methods are (1) light microscopical analysis, which allows for an accurate visualization of PM\nx\ndeposition, and (2) filtration methods, which determine different classes of PM\nx\n. However, the criteria for choosing between methods can be problematic, as the correlation between the results of different approaches is not often demonstrated or discussed.\nThere remains a significant need to identify and characterize plant species that are particularly efficient at accumulating PM\nx\n, as these species could play a crucial role in mitigating urban air pollution. The efficiency of PM\nx\naccumulation varies widely among plant species, and this variation can largely be explained by differences in specific leaf traits. Morphological characteristics, such as leaf shape, size, and surface roughness, have been shown to influence the ability of leaves to capture and retain particles. For instance, species with more complex leaf shapes and greater surface area often exhibit higher PM\nx\naccumulation, as their surfaces provide more opportunities for particles to adhere [\n14\n,\n15\n].\nIn addition to morphology, structural features of the leaf, particularly the composition and thickness of epicuticular waxes, play a pivotal role in determining a plant’s capacity to accumulate PM\nx\n. Waxes can act as a sticky layer, trapping PM\nx\non the leaf surface and preventing it from being resuspended into the atmosphere. Research has demonstrated that species with thicker or more abundant wax layers tend to accumulate higher quantities of PM\nx\n, making wax deposition a key trait in the identification of efficient accumulator species [\n15\n,\n16\n]. Furthermore, physiological traits such as stomatal density, distribution, and function can also impact PM\nx\ncapture, as stomata can either facilitate the internal deposition of smaller particles or be obstructed by PM\nx\n, thereby affecting gas exchange processes.\nTogether, these leaf traits—morphological, structural, and physiological—offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms behind PM\nx\naccumulation and provide valuable criteria for selecting plant species that can effectively improve air quality in urban environments.\nThis study aimed to evaluate and compare two distinct PM\nx\nquantification methods, hypothesizing a high correlation between them. To achieve this, we designed a comprehensive research framework focused on testing these methods’ reliability and applicability in investigating PM\nx\naccumulation on leaves. Furthermore, this study sought to determine the correlation between various leaf traits and PM\nx\naccumulation across different plant species. Our research questions centered on the following: (1) How accurate are the two selected PM\nx\nquantification methods? (2) Which method is more suitable for different research objectives related to PM\nx\naccumulation? (3) What is the correlation between leaf traits and PM\nx\naccumulation in diverse plant species?\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\nThe study was conducted in the province of Lucca, Tuscany, Italy. This region experiences high PM\nx\nlevels due to a combination of factors, including the dispersion of air pollutants hindered by adverse weather conditions such as low wind regimes, stable atmospheric conditions, and shallow thermal inversions [\n17\n].\n2.2. Plant Species\nThe thirty species chosen within the investigated area are listed in\nTable 1\n.\nThe individuals were dispersed across the different zones and were selected considering seasonal, climatical, and logistical parameters to represent the local species’ biodiversity.\nSampling was conducted during the summer (July 2020), when the climate was dry, and leaves were exposed to environmental pollution for more than ten days without rain. Approximately 400 cm\n2\nof leaves per species were sampled, always selecting leaves fully exposed to the surrounding air. The samples were stored in paper bags and taken to the laboratory to be analyzed.\n2.3. The Leaf Covering by PM\nx\nUsing Light Microscopy\nTwo squares (1 cm) per leaf of each sample were analyzed adaxially under a light microscope (10×). The pictures were then processed using ImageJ software (\nhttps://imagej.net/ij/\n) [\n18\n] to verify the percentage of leaf surface covered with PM\nx\n(\nFigure 1\nA,B). A threshold (≥1% of the leaf surface covered with PM\nx\n) was used to select the species for further investigation.\nTo quantify particulate matter (PM\nx\n) using ImageJ, the following steps were carried out: First, the scale was set up to ensure accurate measurement. An image containing a scale bar was opened in ImageJ. Using the Zoom tool, the view was adjusted to focus closely on the scale bar. With the Line tool, a line was drawn along the length of the scale bar to match its size. The “Set Scale” option was then selected from the Analyze menu. In the “Set Scale” dialog box, the known distance of the scale was entered (0.5 in this study). The “Global” option was checked to apply this scale to all future analyses, and then the setup was confirmed by clicking “OK”. Next, the quantification of PM\nx\nwas performed. The image of interest was opened in ImageJ. From the Plugins menu, “Particle Analysis” and then “Grid” were selected. The grid type was set to “line” and the area per point was specified as 100,000 µm\n2\n. A random square area within the image was selected for analysis. The Zoom tool was used to increase the magnification of the selected area. In the analysis phase, the “ROI Manager” was accessed by navigating to “Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager”. The PM\nx\nparticles were identified and selected using the Magic Wand or Ellipse tool. Each selected PM\nx\nwas added to the ROI Manager by clicking “Add” (or using the shortcut key “T”). This process was repeated for all visible PM\nx\nparticles, ensuring that the zoom level remained at 200%. Once all PM\nx\nparticles were selected and added to the ROI Manager, the “Measure” button in the ROI Manager window was clicked to generate the measurements. The resulting data were displayed in a Results window. Finally, the data were copied from the Results window and pasted into an Excel file for further analysis.\n2.4. The Filtration Methodology [\n9\n]\nAfter measuring the leaf area, each leaf sample was agitated and washed for 60 s with 150 mL of deionized water. The washing solution was successively filtered using three filters with specific pore sizes (Sartorius FT-3-104-055 for PM\nx\n≤ 10 μm, Sartorius FT-3-354-110 for PM\nx\n≤ 2.5 μm, and Sartorius 11807-47-N PTFE membrane for PM\nx\n≤ 0.2 μm). Each filter was dried for 30 min at 60 °C, stabilized at a constant relative air humidity (50%) for 60 min, and then pre-weighed. A 47 mm glass filter funnel connected to a vacuum pump was used to perform the filtration (\nFigure 1\nC,D). After filtration, filters were dried again, stabilized at a controlled temperature, and weighed again. The concentration of each PM\nx\nsize was expressed in µg cm\n−2\n.\n2.5. Leaf Traits\nHigh-resolution images of three leaves per sample were taken against a white background and processed using ImageJ to measure the following traits: leaf surface area (LA in cm\n2\n), specific leaf area (SLA in m\n2\nkg\n−1\n) calculated as the leaf area (m\n2\n) per unit leaf dry matter (kg\n−1\n), leaf dissection index (LDI = leaf perimeter/√leaf area), and leaf roundness (leaf roundness = (4 × leaf area)/[π × (major axis)]). Leaf mass per area (LMA) was determined using five discs (8 mm) per leaf of each sample, dried until constant weight, and used to calculate SLA.\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nThe correlation between both methodologies was verified using linear regression, including the data from the 30 species studied. To ensure consistency in the comparison of methodologies, pooled leaf samples from each species were used for analysis rather than multiple samples per species, as the study’s primary focus was on evaluating methodological differences rather than inter-species variation.\nEight species were selected to perform multiple linear regression (MLR) between the leaf traits and PM\nx\naccumulation factors to infer the contribution of leaf traits to the species’ capacity to accumulate PM\nx\n. These species were chosen because they were collected on the same day and in the same city zone (UT), ensuring exposure to similar levels of air pollution, which is necessary for predicting the plant species’ net particle accumulation ability [\n14\n]. The statistical analysis was performed using Origin (Pro), version 2023b (Origin Lab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).\n3. Results\nFigure 2\npresents the values of PM\n10\nand PM\n2.5\nin the study region during the summer of 2020. The PM\n10\nreference limit of 50 µg/m\n3\nwas not exceeded, and the PM\n2.5\nlevels were considered low for the period.\nOut of the 30 species collected, 18 had more than 1% of their leaf area covered with PM\nx\nand were selected for the filtration methodology (\nFigure 3\nB). The filtration method was applied to quantify the amount of PM\nx\nin the leaves of the 16 selected species:\nE. japonicus\n,\nL. lucidum\n,\nA. glutinosa\n,\nR. ulmifolius\n,\nL. nobilis\n,\nO. europaea\n,\nT. x europaea\n,\nA. saccharinum\n,\nA. campestre\n,\nT. cordata\n,\nP. laurocerasus, P. nigra\n,\nS. cinerea\n,\nP. serrulata\n,\nQ. ilex\n, and\nR. chinensis\n. Two species (\nViburnum\nsp. and\nU. minor\n) presented unrealistic data (total PM\nx\n> 100 µg cm\n−2\n) and were excluded from the results. For\nViburnum\nsp., the leaves were sampled from an individual located very close to a high-traffic road, possibly leading to dust contamination and analytical errors. The\nU. minor\nsamples were contaminated by a fungus, likely causing quantification errors.\nThe 14 species not selected were\nA. negundo, S. cinerea, A. campestre, G. biloba, P. domestica, I. walleriana, F. viridissima, N. oleander, S. japonicum, C. australis, G. procumbens, P. alba, U. glabra,\nand\nL. latifolia\n.\nThe results of the filtration are presented in\nFigure 3\nA. The species with the highest total PM\nx\naccumulation (>50 µg cm\n−2\n) were\nE. japonicus\n,\nL. lucidum\n,\nA. glutinosa\n,\nR. ulmifolius\n, and\nL. nobilis\n. Among these,\nE. japonicus\n,\nA. glutinosa\n, and\nL. lucidum\nalso showed high values of PM\nx\n> 10 µm (>50 µg cm\n−2\n). The highest accumulators for PM\nx\naccumulation are between 2.5 and 10 µm (>10 µg cm\n−2\n). The species with the highest PM\nx\naccumulation between 2.0 and 2.5 µm (>10 µg cm\n−2\n) were\nE. japonicus\n,\nR. ulmifolius\n, and\nL. lucidum\n.\nThe linear regression between the two analyses presented a high coefficient of determination (R\n2\n= 0.72), with statistical significance (\np\n> 0.001) and linearity confirmed by a homogeneous distribution of the predicted and residual values (\nFigure 4\n).\nRepresentative values of leaf traits for each species are presented in\nTable 2\n(Part 1). The MLR analysis confirmed that a combination of leaf traits influenced PM\nx\naccumulation (\nTable 2\n, Part 2). The percentage of PM\nx\nwas positively associated with leaf roundness but showed a negative relationship with both LA and SLA. Total PM\nx\nexhibited a negative correlation with SLA, while PM\n10\ndid not correlate with any leaf trait. PM\n2.5\nwas positively associated with LDI and negatively with LA and SLA, whereas PM\n0.2\nwas negatively correlated with LA.\n4. Discussion\nThe PM\nx\nlevels in the sampling region during the summer of 2020 remained within the reference limits. This can be attributed to the expansion of the atmospheric boundary layer, which promotes aerosol dispersion [\n17\n]. Gualtieri et al. [\n19\n] also note that during summer, the accumulation of PM\n10\nis more influenced by the high variability of meteorological conditions than by anthropogenic emissions. Moreover, there is a significant decrease in combustion processes related to agricultural biomass and domestic heating during this season.\nLight microscopy proved effective for visualizing PM\nx\ndeposition on leaves. Although the procedure is simple and inexpensive, it is time-consuming. Its results are comparable to those obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which is more complex, costly, and equally time-consuming, with similar values of leaf coverage (not exceeding 4%) reported by both methods [\n20\n].\nThe values obtained using the filtration methodology were consistent with the literature [\n13\n,\n21\n,\n22\n]. The high total PM\nx\nvalues in this study may be attributed to the method being performed without prior filtration through a sieve to eliminate particles larger than 100 μm. However, this approach might restrict the possibility of having reliable results regarding the accumulation of PM\n10\n; the decision to follow this method was made to ensure comparability between the methodologies.\nThe linear regression analysis confirmed that both methodologies (light microscopy and filtration) are comparable when leaves have more than 1% of their surface covered with PM\nx\n. However, based on our results, we hypothesize that the regression might not be significant for leaves with less than 1% coverage. Light microscopy can underestimate values, as visualization might bias particle size identification if samples appear to have minimal PM\nx\n.\nBoth methodologies have their pros and cons. Light microscopy may be inaccurate for species with trichomes obstructing visualization [\n21\n]. However, it is advantageous for identifying potential analytical errors, such as pathogen contamination, and for screening samples to select leaves with varying PM\nx\ndeposition levels.\nThe filtration method can overestimate PM\nx\naccumulation in plant species that release leaf structures like trichomes during vigorous washing. Additionally, particles forming agglomerates might not accurately reflect particle size fractions (Hofman et al., 2014), and water-soluble particles are not accounted for [\n23\n]. This method may also lack sensitivity for quantifying PM\n0.2\ndue to its low weight; nevertheless, the methodology is fast, low-cost, and practical for processing many samples [\n21\n].\nThe plant community under investigation exhibited a wide range of foliar traits, and the accumulation of PM\nx\nwas negatively correlated with SLA and LA. Plant species with low SLA and high PM\nx\naccumulation likely have more extended leaf longevity or higher leaf wettability (high wettability = high PM\nx\naccumulation). SLA has been recommended as a crucial and easy-to-measure leaf trait for distinguishing between species that are low and high net particle accumulators [\n14\n]. Moreover, recent research in the same region has shown that species with lower LA [\n12\n] and more intricate branch architectures have a greater ability to entrap PM\nx\n[\n24\n]. This finding is further supported by Manzini et al. [\n25\n], who reported that a complex shoot and leaf arrangement is a key factor in PM\nx\ndeposition.\nUnderstanding the influence of leaf morphology on PM\nx\naccumulation is crucial for elucidating species’ differential capacities for PM\nx\ndeposition. On one hand, deciduous species with smaller foliar dimensions and more intricate branch architectures might entrap high levels of PM\nx\n[\n24\n]. On the other hand, a recent comprehensive review synthesizing data on tree traits and PM\nx\naccumulation across diverse species and geographical locations revealed that evergreen conifer needle leaves, as well as small rough leaves, waxy coatings, and high-density trichomes, are potentially beneficial for PM\nx\ncapture [\n26\n,\n27\n]. However, the study finds no consistent evidence to identify the most influential trait due to the diversity in sampling methods and other factors [\n27\n].\nAdditionally, environmental factors can influence leaf traits [\n28\n,\n29\n], and growth rate may significantly impact element deposition [\n20\n]. Specifically, the density of branches and leaves was found to be the most significant factor affecting PM\nx\nretention, with negative effects, suggesting that crown morphological structure is more critical than leaf morphology in screening tree species for efficient PM retention [\n30\n].\n5. Conclusions\nThis study investigated the effectiveness of various plant species in accumulating PM\nx\nto mitigate urban air pollution. Our findings highlight significant differences in PM\nx\naccumulation capacities among the studied species, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate plant species for urban green spaces to enhance air quality.\nOur findings revealed significant disparities in PM\nx\ncapture capabilities among different plant species, underscoring the importance of promoting diverse plant ecosystems within urban landscapes. Among the species analyzed,\nEuonymus japonicus\n,\nLigustrum lucidum\n,\nAlnus glutinosa\n,\nRubus ulmifolius\n, and\nLaurus nobilis\ndemonstrated the highest total PM\nx\naccumulation, exceeding 50 µg cm\n−2\n. These species also exhibited high values of PM\nx\n> 10 µm, indicating their substantial role in capturing larger particulate matter. Specifically,\nEuonymus japonicus\nand\nLigustrum lucidum\nwere notable for their efficiency in capturing PM\nx\nbetween 2.0 and 2.5 µm. Additionally, the correlation between leaf traits and PM\nx\naccumulation was shown to be important when selecting plant species PM\nx\ndeposition.\nBased on our comprehensive research framework and findings, we conclude that PM\nx\naccumulation on leaves is most accurately understood when multiple quantification methods are employed concurrently. Our hypothesis of a high correlation between the two methods was supported, demonstrating that different techniques elucidate various aspects of PM\nx\ndeposition. By comparing data from these methods, researchers can select the most suitable technique based on laboratory capacity and sample size. For instance, filtration methods are particularly effective for large sample sizes, while light microscopy serves as an efficient screening tool for identifying target samples, as demonstrated in our study.\nThe next step in this research involves a more detailed investigation of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the high PM\nx\naccumulation capacity of plant species. Future studies should focus on the physiological and morphological traits that enhance particulate matter capture. Additionally, long-term field studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of these species in different environmental conditions and seasons.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, F.F.; methodology, B.B.M. and F.Z.; validation, Y.H.; formal analysis, B.B.M.; data curation, B.B.M.; writing—original draft preparation, B.B.M.; writing—review and editing, B.B.M. and F.F.; visualization, B.B.M.; supervision, Y.H.,  E.P. and F.F.; project administration, F.M.; funding acquisition, F.M. and F.F.

The reduction in habitat patches in urban areas has a negative impact on the spatial connectivity of adjacent patches, ultimately leading to a decline in the overall connectivity and integrity of the landscape (Matisziw & Murray,\n2009\n; Talebi Khiavi et al.,\n2022\n). These factors have a negative impact on the ecosystem structure, ecological flow circulation, and overall function of the urban ecosystem (Wang et al.,\n2022\n). To effectively address the consequences of landscape change and improve its management, it is essential to have current information and data regarding the speed and extent of alterations in various land use categories and spatial arrangements (Mostafazadeh & Talebi Khiavi,\n2024\n). Urban green spaces (UGS) are public and private areas covered by vegetation in urban areas. As a part of the landscape, UGS plays a vital role in urban planning (Anguluri & Narayanan,\n2017\n; Naseri & Mostafazadeh,\n2023\n) due to their significant contributions to physical and environmental benefits. These areas have environmental, social, cultural, and economic aspects, and their significant impact on human health (Bauwelinck et al.,\n2021\n; Kondo et al.,\n2018\n), land surface temperature (Xu et al.,\n2022a\n,\nb\n), and air purification (Vieira et al.,\n2018\n) has been confirmed by many researchers. In other words, UGS act as urban lungs by retaining pollution and releasing oxygen (Anguluri & Narayanan,\n2017\n). Assessing the spatial distribution of UGS across cities is crucial given their impact on ecological security and the inhabited environment during urban growth (Xu et al.,\n2022a\n,\nb\n). UGS supports both native species and those of conservation concern at regional and global scales, and the size, quantity, and quality of UGS play a crucial role in determining species richness and overall diversity in urban areas (Lepczyk et al.,\n2017\n). Therefore, understanding UGS patterns and ecological connectivity is essential for ecological processes, including the movements of genes, individuals, species, and populations, and provides the baseline required for their characterization (Kowe et al.,\n2021\n; Liu et al.,\n2014\n).\nLiterature review\nUrban development and changes green spaces\nUy and Nakagoshi (\n2007\n) analyzed urban green space patterns and driving forces in Hanoi, Vietnam, and found increased fragmentation of green spaces, especially in the south and west, due to land use change, economic growth, population increase, urbanization, and inadequate planning. Huang et al. (\n2021\n) investigated the impact of urbanization on green spaces in Fuzhou City, assessing fragmentation using landscape pattern and spatial syntactic attributes. They analyzed an ecological network and evaluated green space improvement through corridor structure analysis, revealing significant urbanization and fragmentation trends from 2000 to 2021. Wu and Qian (\n2022\n) developed an integrated method using CA-Markov, MSPA, and graph theory to assess the impact of urban land use change on green space connectivity in Nanjing, China, and found that ecological land protection increased forest and grassland, but urban expansion remained a significant barrier to connectivity. Urban development plays a pivotal role in shaping the quality of life for city residents, and the incorporation of well-designed urban green spaces is integral to fostering sustainable and livable urban environments (Jahandari et al.,\n2022\n; Roy et al.,\n2022\n). Therefore, integrating green spaces into urban development plans enhances the aesthetic appeal of cities, promotes environmental sustainability, and positively impacts the physical and mental well-being of residents (Roy et al.,\n2024\n). These green spaces act as lungs for the city, contributing to air quality improvement, while also providing recreational areas for community engagement. Recognizing the importance of urban green space design ensures that cities evolve in harmony with nature, creating resilient and inclusive spaces for current and future generations.\nSpatial pattern and UGS and landscape connectivity\nNumerous studies have investigated the ecological connectivity of UGS using different approaches, such as circuit theory (An et al.,\n2020\n), minimum cost distance method (Guo et al.,\n2020\n; Watts & Handley,\n2010\n), and graph theory (Saura & Torné,\n2009\n; Wang et al.,\n2022\n). Among these, graph-based analysis is widely considered a useful and effective visual method in practical landscape analysis and habitat modeling by many researchers (Liu et al.,\n2014\n). Saura and Pascual-Hortal (\n2007\n) developed a new index and compared it with ten other graph-based connectivity indices to evaluate their responses to various changes in the landscape. Kong et al. (\n2010\n) studied urban green space network development in Jinan City, China, aiming to identify potential corridors and improve connectivity using graph theory and the gravity model. The research emphasized the significance of incorporating these approaches into urban planning for effective biodiversity conservation. Using graph theory, Kang and Park (\n2011\n) analyzed Seoul’s green space network from 1975 to 2006. They observed notable connectivity changes over the 30-year period. The study identified core habitat areas supporting diverse wildlife and stepping stones that connected these core areas. The findings highlighted the correlation between green space connectivity and relative importance, providing a graphical representation of Seoul’s green space networks. Baranyi et al. (\n2011\n) analyzed 13 graph indices to evaluate patch orders and identify the index that best addressed topological characteristics. The results revealed that the integral index of connectivity (IIC), probability of connectivity (PC), and betweenness centrality (BC) were unique in their focus on the way habitat patches function. Rajput (\n2018\n) applied a graph theory framework to analyze forest connectivity and identify important individual forest patches in the Pennar River basin, India. The study used a binary connection model and graph-theoretic indices such as the integral index connectivity and H Harary to quantify ecological connectivity.\nShafinejad et al. (\n2018\n) used graph theory to assess the ecological connectivity of urban green patches in Ahvaz, Iran. Their findings indicated that the fourth municipal zone had the highest number and largest green patches. Wang et al. (\n2022\n) studied urban agglomeration’s effect on landscape connectivity in the Huangshui River Valley and observed a substantial urbanization over three decades, resulting in reduced farmland and varying natural habitat. Urban agglomeration intensified heterogeneity and fragmentation, especially in the central region, adversely impacting landscape connectivity. Liu et al. (\n2022\n) created a methodology to integrate structural and functional connectivity analysis in building an urban green infrastructure (UGI) network in Beijing and identified source patches, examined diffusion distances’ impact on landscape connectivity, and found significant contributions from mountain and hilly areas. Zhou et al. (\n2023\n) optimized an urban green space ecological network in Chengdu, China, for biodiversity conservation and established a connected network with structural and functional connectivity using MSPA, landscape metrics, graph theory, and circuit theory.\nScope and objective\nStudies have shown that graph-based connectivity indices provide valuable information on the ecological connectivity of individual patches in the landscape and can help identify important areas for conservation planning. The use of graph theory has also revealed the positive impacts of increasing green space connectivity, such as improved biodiversity, air quality, and social well-being in various urban areas. However, urban agglomeration and expansion can severely damage the ecological connectivity of natural habitats and green spaces, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in urban planning. Nevertheless, integrating graph theory in green space planning and management can lead to the creation of more sustainable and resilient urban environments that support the well-being of residents and conservation of biodiversity. Green spaces are essential for urban planning as they offer numerous benefits for the environment, public health, and social well-being. Studies have demonstrated that UGSs can mitigate the effects of climate change, reduce air and noise pollution, and improve mental health and quality of life for residents (Heynen et al.,\n2006\n; Hussain et al.,\n2024\n). However, the arrangement and connectivity of green spaces can significantly impact their effectiveness and accessibility, which highlights the importance of designing green spaces that are well-connected and easily accessible to the public. Furthermore, the arrangement of green spaces can also impact their ecological value and ability to support local wildlife. Incorporating green space connectivity and arrangement into urban planning can be challenging as it requires balancing competing priorities and addressing issues such as land use, transportation, and community engagement (Lafortezza et al.,\n2013\n). However, the benefits of well-planned and connected green spaces are significant, making it an important area for continued research and development in urban planning. Ardabil city in Iran showcases traditional Iranian urbanism with a labyrinthine design of narrow streets and alleys that create privacy, security, and community for residents. The historic bazaar, one of Iran’s largest and best-preserved, features intricate brick and tile work and interconnected courtyards. Public squares and parks serve as accessible gathering places. Ardabil is a medium-sized city known for its cultural and historical heritage, natural hot springs, and significance in agriculture and industry, including carpet weaving and silk production. Despite its size, Ardabil’s urban design highlights its rich history and deep understanding of traditional Iranian urbanism. Given the intensified urban development in Ardabil and widespread migration from surrounding areas to this city, incorporating adequately sized and strategically located urban spaces in Ardabil’s urban development plans is essential, justifying the necessity of this research. Currently, the per capita green space is less than 8 m\n2\nper person, and Ardabil falls below the global standard of 15 m\n2\nper person compared to other cities in Iran. Reports emphasize the undeniable need for green space development in cities, and the Ardabil Municipality is actively working towards increasing the city’s per capita green space. Therefore, monitoring these changes can assist urban planners in improving the city’s green space and its urban functions. The main hypotheses of this research were that the connectivity of UGS nodes (dNL) in Ardabil city has decreased over consecutive periods and that UGS connectivity varies across different municipal zones, with newly developed areas and well-allocated UGSs contributing to higher connectivity in certain zones. The aim of this study is to use graph-based metrics to calculate the connectivity of UGS across the main municipal zones of Ardabil city over consecutive periods under changing population growth rates. Another objective of this study is to compare the UGS connectivity values across the four municipal zones and to assess changes in connectivity indices at different distance thresholds of UGS patches.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area\nArdabil is situated in the center of Ardabil province, located between 38° 12′ and 38° 18′ N latitudes and 48° 14′ to 48° 20′ E longitudes, covering an area of 18.01 km\n2\n(Fig.\n1\n). The city lies between the eastern slopes of the Sabalan Mountains and the western border of the Caspian Sea. Ardabil city has four different climates: warm Mediterranean, temperate Mediterranean, cold and temperate mountainous, with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 7 °C and 290 mm, respectively (Ghazavi et al.,\n2020\n). It experiences around 130 annual glacial days. Ardabil city is one of the coldest regions in Iran and the province, with cold weather prevailing for around 5–8 months of the year. The elevation in the study area ranges from 1149 to 4773 m.\nFig. 1\nGeographical location of Ardabil city in Ardabil province and Iran\nFull size image\nMethodology\nUrban green space extraction\nGiven the effectiveness and broad applicability of remote sensing techniques for analyzing diverse land surface changes, this study assesses the trends and extent of urban growth and development in Ardabil over a 12-year period (2003 to 2017). Land cover maps were derived from Landsat satellite images taken in 2003, 2007, 2012, and 2017. These images were georeferenced using UTM coordinate systems, with corrections made for radiometric and atmospheric errors (Abdolalizadeh et al.,\n2019\n; Aghaei et al.,\n2020\n). ERDAS and ArcGIS 10.8 software were utilized to delineate green space boundaries. After obtaining satellite images in three bands and merging them into red, green, and blue bands using ENVI 5.3 software, the Landsat images have been classified using maximum likelihood method (Talebi Khiavi & Mostafazadeh,\n2021\n). This classification method accurately distinguishes between different land cover types by analyzing pixel spectral signatures. Results were validated by comparing them with the Ardabil urban development plan’s green space map and digitized Google Earth maps. Validation involved cross-referencing with urban planning documents and high-resolution images and field surveys to confirm green space presence. Integrating remote sensing with field observations ensures a comprehensive and accurate assessment of urban green space dynamics.\nCalculation of graph-based connectivity indices and distance threshold analysis\nGraph theory is used to analyze complex networks of functional connections, optimizing mathematical operations and overcoming computational constraints related to large datasets and connectivity analyses. Large-scale connectivity analysis may involve computations with hundreds of nodes and edges, requiring significant computational efficiency (Bunn et al.,\n2000\n). Nodes represent UGS patches and links symbolize potential connectivity between nodes (Urban et al.,\n2009\n). Graph structures and algorithms are effective for depicting landscape patterns as networks of interconnected patches and for analyzing UGS connectivity (Jordán et al.,\n2003\n; Pascual-Hortal & Saura,\n2008\n; Ricotta et al.,\n2000\n).\nThis study used Conefor Sensinode 2.6 (CS26) software, known for assessing landscape connectivity and habitat fragmentation (García-Marmolejo et al.,\n2020\n; Shafinejad et al.,\n2018\n). Graph-based analysis via CS26 is valuable for evaluating UGS connectivity (Li et al.,\n2022\n), identifying conservation priorities, and assessing habitat fragmentation, crucial for biodiversity preservation (Lin et al.,\n2021\n; Saura & Torné,\n2009\n). It provides insights into UGS network effectiveness and helps prioritize interventions based on impact potential (Yusof et al.,\n2022\n). This method enhances understanding of green space arrangement and connectivity for sustainable urban development (Selim & Demir,\n2019\n). CS26 uses graph theory methods, like network and centrality analyses, to identify crucial connectivity sites, making it a comprehensive platform for ecological studies (García-Marmolejo et al.,\n2020\n; Newman,\n2018\n). Choosing suitable graph-based indices and parameters tailored to the study area and objectives is essential for precise results. In this study, the user-defined network was built on the spatial relationship and proximity between green patches, with patch distances weighted accordingly. Various connectivity indices like dNL, dIIC, dPC, dPCconnector, dF, and dBC-PC were selected for their relevance and sensitivity to distance changes, providing insights into connectivity patterns and spatial proximity arrangement (Baranyi et al.,\n2011\n; Saura & Pascual-Hortal,\n2007\n; Shafinejad et al.,\n2018\n), detailing the selected indices and calculations in Table\n1\n.\nTable 1 Selected metrics for connectivity analysis of the UGSs in Ardabil city, Iran\nFull size table\nThese metrics are preferred due to their ability to capture different aspects of connectivity dynamics, such as network structure, spatial arrangement, and patch importance. The selected metrics serve specific purposes in evaluating landscape connectivity and habitat fragmentation. For example, dIIC and dPC provide a comprehensive understanding of overall connectivity and its probability, while dBC highlights critical patches for maintaining network integrity. The number of links (dNL) metric quantifies the total number of links between patches, providing an overview of overall connectivity. The integral index of connectivity (dIIC) evaluates the integral connectivity of the landscape, considering both spatial arrangement and internal connections of patches. The probability of connectivity (dPC) and probability of connectivity connector (dPCconnector) assess the likelihood of connectivity between patches and the contribution of individual nodes to network connectivity, respectively. The flux (dF) metric quantifies the flow of connectivity between patches, while the betweenness centrality (dBC) identifies critical patches for maintaining network integrity. These metrics are selected based on their relevance and sensitivity to distance changes, providing insights into connectivity patterns and spatial proximity arrangement.\nThe selection of appropriate distances for the analysis of UGSs in an urban landscape is crucial. Based on the distribution of UGS in the landscape, distance thresholds of 100 to 1000 m resulted in a landscape predominantly comprised of independent patches and small habitat clusters. Consequently, six distances, namely 5000; 10,000; 15,000; 20,000; 25,000; and 30,000 m, were considered, and the changes in metrics were examined in nodes and along the distance in the four municipal areas of Ardabil city.\nThe changes in UGS connectivity over the studied years were graphically analyzed. Additionally, variations in UGS connectivity indices across different municipal zones of Ardabil were visually examined using spatial maps.\nPopulation and green space per capita changes in municipal zones over the study period\nPopulation data for the years 2003, 2007, 2012, and 2017 were collected from the Statistical Center of Iran and municipal reports of Ardabil city to calculate population density for each municipal zone. The UGS data for the same periods were analyzed to evaluate changes in green space areas. The results were interpreted to assess changes in population density and UGS over the study period. Maps showing UGS distribution and connectivity for each period across different municipal zones were generated to visually represent the spatial changes.\nResults\nUrban green space and its spatial pattern in Ardabil city\nFigure\n2\nshows the classified map of the study area and the distribution of UGSs.\nFig. 2\nClassified map of the UGSs and distribution area on nodes\nFull size image\nIn 2003 and 2007, node 65 with an area of 1.18 km\n2\nand node 208 with an area of 0.062 km\n2\nhad the largest area in Municipal Zone 2 of Ardabil. However, in 2012 and 2017, node 232 with an area of 0.264 km\n2\nand node 677 with an area of 0.293 km\n2\nhad the largest area in Municipal Zone 2. It should be noted that parts of the southern regions in the study area were previously covered with large natural orchards and green spaces, which have disappeared in recent periods. It is noteworthy that these areas, situated around the city and near the Shorabil Lake and Naderi township, have transformed into urban developments and residential zones, leading to a significant reduction in green spaces. In the past, some large green spaces were primarily associated with suburban gardens, which were owned by landowners. However, in recent years, due to urban development, they have been sold off and converted into residential lands. Consequently, the loss of these large green patches has notably impacted the overall reduction in connectivity within the green spaces.\nChanges of the connectivity indices over different distance thresholds\nThe examination of changes in the study indices at varying distance thresholds provides insights into the connectivity of green patches in the urban green landscape, as shown in Fig.\n3\n.\nFig. 3\nOverall connectivity indices value at different distance thresholds in different years\nFull size image\nFigure\n3\nillustrates that the dNL, dIIC, dF, dPC, and dPCflux indices showed no changes at different threshold distances in 2003, 2007, and 2017, indicating consistent green patch connectivity at these distances. Conversely, the dPCconnector index had the highest values at a threshold distance of 5000 m, decreasing beyond this, suggesting reduced patch connectivity with increasing distance thresholds across all years studied. Additionally, the dBC_PC index had the lowest values at a threshold distance of 5000 m and increased with higher threshold distances in all years. Notably, in 2012, the connectivity indices behaved differently: the values of dNL, dIIC, dF, dPCflux, and dPC increased with increasing threshold distances, showing greater variation. In contrast, the dBC_PC index had lower values at 5000 m, then increased before decreasing at higher threshold distances (30,000 m).\nConnectivity changes in different municipality zones of Ardabil\nFigure\n4\nshows the distribution of connectivity indices in different years using the box plot.\nFig. 4\nBox plot of different indices of UGSs’ connectivity over different periods\nFull size image\nThe largest value for all study indices was observed in 2003, indicating high connectivity of UGSs in Ardabil city that year. Among the indices, NL had the highest value with a minimum and maximum of 0.13 and 4.17 in 2003, while the lowest value was obtained in 2017 with a minimum and maximum of 0.01 and 0.49, respectively. This suggests a decline in UGS connectivity during the study period. The dIIC index is highly regarded for connectivity analysis as it considers both the topological location and internal values of individual patches and their internal connections (Bodin & Norberg,\n2007\n). The largest and smallest ranges of dIIC were observed in 2003 and 2017, with average values of 17.17 and 54.4, respectively. In 2012, dIIC had a larger range (2.43–4.24) than in 2007. Furthermore, the largest node (with over 800 nodes) in the green area was observed in 2012, indicating the importance of these patches in that year.\nThe dPC index had the highest range of values in 2003, with a highest average of 2.30. However, in the following year, the distribution of values became closer, ranging from 0.06 to 6.53, with a lower average of 1.59. In 2012, the dPC index ranged from 0.00 to 1.25. In the last year of the study, the dPC index had the smallest range of values (0.00–3.76) and the lowest average (0.63). High values of dPC are significant for biodiversity protection, as these areas can be considered ecological sources and important core areas (Wang et al.,\n2022\n). The maximum and minimum values of this index in 2007 were 3.39 and 0.00, respectively. The dPCconnector fraction measures how much a node contributes to network connectivity (Cortes et al.,\n2019\n). The largest and smallest ranges of dPCconnector were observed in 2003 and 2017, with an average of 0.13 and 0.07, respectively. In 2012, the dPCconnector experienced a larger range of values (0.00–0.82) than in the previous year (2007).\nFigure\n5\nshows the diagram of all nodes value of graph-based indices.\nFig. 5\nComparison of connectivity indices of UGS in different municipal zones over different years\nFull size image\nFigure\n5\ndepicts variations in connectivity across all municipal zones within Ardabil city. Municipal Zone 1, spanning an area of 1160.60 hectares, displayed a declining trend in connectivity throughout the study period, with the most significant decrease noted in 2003. In Municipal Zone 2, connectivity indices declined over the initial three years of the study (2003, 2007, and 2012), followed by a slight recovery in the final year (2017), suggesting an improvement in UGS connectivity during that period. Municipal Zone 3, covering an area of 1597.79 hectares, exhibited optimal connectivity conditions in 2003, which decreased in 2007 and 2012 but improved in 2017. Among Ardabil’s other municipal zones, Municipal Zone 4 demonstrated the most favorable connectivity conditions during the study period. Similarly, the highest connectivity value was observed in 2003, followed by a decrease in the subsequent years. However, this trend reversed in 2012 with an enhancement in connectivity indices, a trend that persisted into 2017.\nPopulation changes in municipal zones over the study years\nAssessing the UGS areas and population changes over time can provide insights into the variations in per capita green spaces. According to the results of Table\n2\n, the population in the four municipal zones of Ardabil city is increasing. Based on the results of Table\n2\nand Fig.\n5\n, the dPCconnector index in Municipal Zone 1 had a decreasing trend in 2007 and 2013 compared to 2003, but increased in 2017. According to the results of dPC and dIIC indices, Municipal Zone 1 has experienced a decreasing trend, as the population in this municipal zone increased from 88,862 in 2003 to 106,479 in 2017. This result indicates a significant decrease in green space connectivity with an increase in population. In Municipal Zone 3, most of the branches examined showed an increasing trend in 2017 compared to 2012, while the population growth rate increased by 3.5% from 2012 to 2017. Moreover, according to the results of Municipal Zone 4, despite an increase in population, there was a decreasing trend in the dPC and dIIC indices from 2007 to 2003, followed by an increasing trend. In Municipal Zone 4, the population growth rate was 19% from 2003 to 2017.\nTable 2 Population, UGS area, and green space per capita in municipal of Ardabil city over different years\nFull size table\nIn 2003, Zone 2 had a significantly higher green space area compared to other zones, with Zone 1 and Zone 3 trailing far behind. By 2017, while all zones saw an increase in green space area, Zone 3 experienced the most substantial rise in 2012. Green space per capita metrics reveal even more significant disparities. In 2003, Zone 2 had an exceptionally high green space per capita (20.51 m\n2\n/person), whereas Zone 3 and Zone 4 had much lower values (0.57 m\n2\n/person and 0.54 m\n2\n/person, respectively). By 2017, the green space per capita in Zone 1 increased dramatically to 6.30 m\n2\n/person from 2.07 m\n2\n/person in 2003, highlighting a considerable improvement in accessibility. Conversely, Zone 2 saw a drastic reduction in green space per capita from 20.51 m\n2\n/person in 2003 to 7.18 m\n2\n/person in 2017, indicating a significant decline in green space availability per resident. While all zones experienced population growth, Zone 3 had the largest increase, growing from 173,535 in 2003 to 207,937 in 2017. This population surge, coupled with the changing green space areas, influenced the green space per capita calculations significantly. For instance, despite the large green space area in Zone 3 in 2017, its per capita green space (4.74 m\n2\n/person) remained lower than Zone 1 due to the higher population. As a conclusion, Zone 2’s initial advantage in green space area and per capita has diminished over time, while Zone 3 has shown significant improvement. The data in Table\n2\nindicates that the population of Ardabil city has steadily increased over the past 15 years, with the total population reaching 605,992 in 2017. This growth in population has likely contributed to the significant reduction in green space availability in the city.\nDiscussion\nChanges of UGS area in Ardabil city\nAccording to the results, during the study period, some of the large urban green patches have experienced a reduction in area (Fig.\n2\n). However, overall, the number of green space patches has increased with the expansion of urban areas. It is worth mentioning that although orchards have been removed from old urban areas, urban development has provided the opportunity to allocate spaces for creating green areas in new urban areas. The importance of expanding UGSs in addressing the impacts of climate change and improving urban biodiversity and residents’ well-being has also been emphasized in the research of Singh (\n2018\n), Yilmaz and Terzi (\n2023\n), and Halecki et al., (\n2023\n).\nConnectivity changes in different municipal zones of Ardabil\nAccording to the results presented in Fig.\n4\n, the amount of all connectivity indices demonstrated a decreasing trend from the first to the last study year (2003 to 2017), indicating a reduced connectivity among green patches of UGS. However, in 2012, there was an increase in the number of green space patches in the study area. During the study years, the significance of the number of green spaces in urban areas is underscored by factors such as population growth and the increasing demand for residential areas and incorporating green spaces in urban development plans. Yu et al. (\n2017\n) noted that the implementation of new urban greening strategies in Hangzhou has led to the establishment of a green space network, significantly fragmenting built-up areas and enhancing the diversity of the urban landscape. Also, Li et al. (\n2019\n) highlighted the challenges due to Beijing’s rapid urbanization and planning policies, emphasizing the need for adopting sustainable approaches in urban green space planning. The findings of Chiu and Yeh’s study in\n2023\nreveal a landscape pattern of fragmentation in the urban fringe area of the Taipei metropolitan region. This underscores the importance of prioritizing the enhancement of green infrastructures to foster ecosystem services in the urban areas, ultimately fortifying their capacity to adapt to climate change.\nVariation of connectivity indices in different distance thresholds\nThe dNL, dIIC, dF, dPC, and dPCflux indices remained stable across different distances, indicating consistent connectivity and arrangement of green patches. Conversely, the dPCconnector index peaked at 5000 m, then declined, suggesting key nodes become less influential with increasing distances. The dBC_PC index, identifying critical network patches, was low at 5000 m but increased with higher thresholds, implying these patches gain importance over larger distances. In 2012, greater variability in these indices indicated significant changes in connectivity dynamics. These variations help determine optimal distances for interpreting UGS connectivity. The delta of PC (dPC) quantifies the distinct contribution of each patch to the comprehensive connectivity of the ecological network. It specifically identifies critical patches for PC, a metric utilized by Guo et al. (\n2018\n) for the identification of key green spaces as habitats. Furthermore, Pascual-Hortal and Saura (\n2008\n) concluded that the dPC exhibits effectiveness in determining the significance of a patch’s importance. The dPC and dLCP indices are better metrics for assessing connectivity among and within habitat patches compared to other indices (Baranyi et al.,\n2011\n). The dPC index uses the maximum probability rather than topological distance between patches, making it the recommended metric for connectivity analysis in a CS26 environment. This index provides several relevant features and properties and improves the performance of dIIC (Saura & Pascual-Hortal,\n2007\n). Additionally, the dPC index employs a rich connectivity model, disregarding adjacent habitat patches or cells in the dataset (Baranyi et al.,\n2011\n).\nSelection and justification of the graph-based indices\nIn this study, the graph-based connectivity indices (dNL, dIIC, dF, dPC, and dPCconnector) were chosen based on their relevance to assessing various aspects of green space connectivity, which is crucial for understanding ecological networks and proximity in urban green spaces and public spaces. The dNL (node link) index was chosen because it directly measures the connectivity between green space nodes, providing insights into how green spaces are connected within the urban area. The dIIC (integral index of connectivity) is highly regarded for its comprehensive consideration of both the topological location and internal connections of green space patches, making it a robust metric for urban green space connectivity analysis (Bodin & Norberg,\n2007\n). The dF (flux) index helps in understanding the potential proximity and connectivity of urban green spaces, reflecting the functional connectivity of the urban green spaces. The dPC (probability of connectivity) and dPCconnector indices were selected because they quantify the overall connectivity probability and the specific contribution of each patch to the network connectivity, respectively. High values of dPC are significant for biodiversity protection, as these areas can be considered ecological sources and important core areas (Wang et al.,\n2022\n). The dPCconnector fraction, as highlighted by Cortes et al. (\n2019\n), measures how much a node contributes to network connectivity, thus identifying critical urban green spaces that facilitate connection across the urban landscape. The choice of these indices was guided by their ability to provide a detailed and multifaceted understanding of connectivity, considering both structural and functional aspects of the green space network. This comprehensive approach enables us to identify key patches and corridors essential for maintaining and enhancing urban green space functionality. Using these indices, targeted recommendations can be made for urban green space planning and management to ensure that ecological connectivity is preserved and enhanced over time.\nPopulation changes and UGS per capita in municipal zones over the study years\nEvaluating the relationship between urban green spaces and population density uncovers fluctuations in per capita green spaces. Population expansion is noticeable across all four municipal zones in Ardabil city (Table\n2\n). In 2003, Zone 2 had the highest green space area and per capita (20.51 m\n2\n/person), with Zones 1, 3, and 4 much lower. By 2017, green space areas increased in all zones, with Zone 3 seeing the largest rise. Zone 1’s per capita green space improved significantly to 6.30 m\n2\n/person, while Zone 2 declined to 7.18 m\n2\n/person. Population growth, especially in Zone 3, influenced per capita values despite larger green spaces. Overall, Zone 2’s initial advantage diminished, and Zone 3 improved significantly, as Ardabil’s population reached 605,992 in 2017, affecting green space availability.\nZone 1 had a notable increase in UGS per capita from 2003 to 2017, suggesting efforts to improve UGS accessibility. Conversely, Zone 2 experienced a decline in UGS per capita during this period, possibly due to urban development or changes in land use. Zone 3 showed fluctuations in UGS per capita, peaking in 2012 and slightly decreasing in 2017, influenced by factors like population growth and urban development. Research suggests aiming for 9 to 11 m\n2\nof UGS per capita for urban well-being, necessitating comprehensive urban planning and collaboration among municipal policymakers to set optimal UGS per capita targets in Ardabil city.\nFluctuations in UGS can be attributed to various factors, such as the disappearance of old urban parks and orchards in peri-urban areas and the construction of new parks and UGS in newly developed townships. These changes reflect the dynamic nature of urban landscapes and evolving urban planning priorities. Limitations in UGS detection methods, including satellite image resolution and classification algorithms, may restrict sensitivity to subtle changes in UGS patterns. Additionally, the disappearance and emergence of UGS patches, along with their growth or shrinkage, may stem from urban development dynamics and municipal policies aimed at constructing new UGS and public parks within the study area.\nBille et al. (\n2023\n) emphasize a strong global correlation between development status, population density, and urban green space, advocating for the integration of nature into urban development to enhance human well-being. Xu et al. (\n2022a\n,\nb\n) analyze Pan-European urban green space dynamics, noting a disparity in per capita urban green space among European countries, particularly in Southern Europe. They highlight the importance of prioritizing green spaces in urban planning to address population growth impacts and maintain ecosystem connectivity. Haaland and van Den Bosch (\n2015\n) discuss challenges in supplying urban green space within compact city settings, noting the inadequacy of public green space to compensate for the loss of private green areas during densification. Jia et al. (\n2023\n) introduce a method for evaluating urban green spaces (UGSs) based on connectivity and accessibility, providing a framework for sustainable urban development. Gavrilidis et al. (\n2022\n) analyze small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Bucharest, Romania, revealing greener communist-planned residential neighborhoods compared to developed areas. They suggest their findings as guidance for policymakers to expand green infrastructure and distribute UGSs effectively in vulnerable areas.\nPolicy implications\nThe results reveal significant changes in the connectivity of urban green spaces (UGSs) in Ardabil over time, highlighting the need for strategic urban planning and green space management. The observed decrease in UGS connectivity, especially in highly populated zones, underscores the urgent need for policies prioritizing the preservation and expansion of green spaces. Urban planners should integrate green infrastructure into development plans, ensuring new projects include provisions for green spaces. Establishing green corridors and networks can enhance connectivity and mitigate fragmentation from urban expansion. Policies should encourage interconnected green patches to maintain ecological balance and provide recreational spaces. The findings also emphasize the importance of monitoring UGS changes using advanced metrics like the graph-based indices employed in this study. These metrics enable better assessment and management of green space connectivity, leading to informed decisions that enhance urban resilience and sustainability. Specific zones, such as Zone 4, have shown improvements in connectivity, offering successful examples for replication in other areas. Our study provides actionable insights for urban planning and green space management policies in Ardabil and similar cities, ensuring green spaces remain integral to urban landscapes, benefiting residents and overall sustainability.\nThe findings of this study, which utilize graph-based connectivity indices, have significant potential for application in other regions and under various urbanization scenarios. By demonstrating the dynamic nature of UGS connectivity over time in Ardabil, our methodology can serve as a model for other cities experiencing similar urban expansion pressures. The functional connectivity indices used (dNL, dIIC, dPC, dPCconnector, and dF) provide a comprehensive understanding of green space connectivity, which can be adapted to different urban contexts. For instance, cities in rapidly urbanizing regions could use these metrics to identify critical green patches and corridors, informing strategic planning efforts aimed at enhancing ecological networks and mitigating habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, our approach of analyzing connectivity at different distance thresholds can be valuable in assessing the impact of various urbanization scenarios, such as high-density developments or sprawling suburban expansions, on UGS connectivity.\nContributions and limitations\nThis study adds to the literature by utilizing graph-based metrics to evaluate the connectivity of urban green spaces (UGSs) in a developing Iranian city, offering insights into the changes in patterns of UGS over time. Unlike prior studies that focused on size or distribution, this research uniquely analyzes graph-based indices variations at different thresholds, providing insights into changes in UGSs over time and facilitating their analysis in relation to UGS per capita. The temporal aspect reveals connectivity fluctuations during the study period, showcasing the dynamic nature of UGSs amid urban development. Unlike similar research, employing graph-based indices (dNL, dIIC, dPC, dPCconnector) in this study offers detailed insights into connectivity trends, providing a quantitative assessment of UGS connectivity changes over time. The recognition of distinct municipal zones with diverse connectivity adds valuable information for localized urban planning in newly developed areas around the city. Promoting healthy communities means ensuring fair access to green spaces, aligning their distribution with local needs in urban planning. Integrating ecological and social factors into green space management balances conservation, public health, and social equity. Allocating ample land for urban parks, ensuring easy access, and regular maintenance are crucial. Redesigning existing green areas for better accessibility can enhance their functionality. The study did not explore the impact of urban development policies and economic factors on urban development and green spaces, offering an opportunity for future research. Integrating green spaces into urban planning offers various benefits for residents, including enhanced physical and mental health, social cohesion, and economic advantages (Halecki et al.,\n2023\n; Kabisch et al.,\n2015\n). Furthermore, investigating the relationship of the UGSs connectivity and various aspects, including health, leisure time activities, educational functions, and urban ecosystem services, could significantly enrich the depth and breadth of the research findings. The study did not consider resolution in UGS determination, potentially impacting connectivity analysis accuracy. Additionally, urban conservation areas were not examined, affecting green space connectivity and preservation. Transportation networks were not evaluated as edges, possibly influencing urban green space accessibility. Demographic factors, like connectivity and per capita area, were not incorporated, missing insights into green space usage by different groups. Furthermore, the specific characteristics of green areas were not detailed, impacting their ecological value and recreational potential.\nConclusion\nThis study explores the temporal variations in UGS connectivity across Ardabil’s four municipal zones. Utilizing graph-based metrics to assess green patch connectivity in different municipal zones over time. Graph-based analysis provides a quantitative approach for analyzing the connectivity of green spaces and identifying important core areas for conservation efforts, which has been widely used in previous studies to evaluate the connectivity of green spaces in urban areas and inform urban planning and green space management policies (Eigenbrod et al.,\n2010\n(. The varying connectivity across municipal zones emphasizes the necessity for tailored planning strategies to address distinct characteristics and needs in different urban areas. Zone-wise analysis determined the differences in connectivity and spatial patterns of UGSs. The study supports sustainable urban development policies, focusing the importance of creating and preserving UGS links. It emphasizes the need for strategic urban planning and design aimed to foster healthier, more resilient urban environments by enhancing UGS connectivity aimed ongoing urban development and population growth challenges. According to the findings, the connectivity between UGS nodes (dNL) in Ardabil city has indeed decreased over consecutive periods, validated by the decreasing trend in connectivity at various distances over the study years. It was also confirmed that UGS connectivity varies across different municipal zones, with Zones 1, 2, and 3 showing a decline, while connectivity in all four zones improved after 2012. Additionally, newly developed urban areas and well-allocated UGSs, as seen in Zone 4, contributed to higher UGS connectivity. Temporal changes in UGS spatial connectivity indices inform decision-making across municipal zones, supporting the hypothesis regarding UGS spatial configuration’s significance in urban planning. Zone-specific UGS connectivity comparisons aid in prioritizing urban zones to enhance per capita UGS access and understand functionality variations. Enhanced UGS connectivity offers social benefits, like mitigating urban heat islands and managing surface runoff. Sustained monitoring and management efforts are crucial for UGS long-term sustainability, evident in Municipal Zone 2’s patch decrease in 2017. These insights inform urban planning and green space management policies, enhancing residents’ green space access and urban environments. The study findings aid managers and policymakers in pinpointing priority areas for safeguarding and improving UGS connectivity. Subsequent research can delve into urban planning in newly urbanized regions to guarantee the proper dispersion of UGS and boost UGS per capita. Assessing the efficacy of diverse urban planning strategies, like green infrastructure and mixed-use development, can shape policies fostering sustainable urban development and augmenting UGS accessibility and quality for urban residents. Future research can explore interdisciplinary approaches to integrate ecological and social factors into urban planning and design.\nData availability\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\nReferences\nAbdolalizadeh, Z., Ebrahimi, A., & Mostafazadeh, R.

Environmental data collection in urban areas is often limited and poorly coordinated between multiple agencies (Marx et al.,\n2023\n; Niemczynowicz,\n1999\n). Consequently, while modeling urban storm drainage to help manage flood risk is commonplace, the complex interactions between engineered urban water management systems and what remains of the more natural hydrology of urban greenspaces and any rural hinterland have only recently been the focus of attention (Marx et al.,\n2022\n; Oswald et al.,\n2023\n). Moreover, the cumulative effects of ongoing urban (re-)development and the\nmemory\neffects of historic management changes may be unknown (Marlow et al.,\n2013\n). This lack of scientific understanding poses challenges for the future management of urban water resources. A firm knowledge of urban hydrological function is a prerequisite to anticipating and sustainably managing emerging pressures from the population growth, urban expansion, and climate change impacts expected in many urban centers (Miller & Hutchins,\n2017\n; Niemczynowicz,\n1999\n).\nFortunately, the last few decades have seen increasingly integrated approaches to\ncatchment science\n. These provide a fuller, more nuanced approach to understanding hydrological function, by integrating diverse complementary field data on the water cycle beyond simply rainfall and runoff (Hutchins et al.,\n2017\n). These include hydroclimatic fluxes (Vulova et al.,\n2023\n), isotopic and water quality characteristics (Kuhlemann et al.,\n2020\n), soil moisture and groundwater processes (Duethmann et al.,\n2022\n; Schaffitel et al.,\n2020\n), and vegetation parameters (Bernard et al.,\n2022\n; Crampe et al.,\n2021\n); data which are either empirically derived or remotely sensed at various spatial and temporal scales. Such data can then drive exploratory, multi-calibrated modeling to develop hypotheses of hydrological functions (e.g., Birkel et al.,\n2014\n; Kuppel et al.,\n2018\n). Rainfall-runoff models can then be tested against more focused field data collection and/or support more advanced modeling that goes beyond these more traditional approaches to understanding the rainfall-runoff transformation that is the basis of urban flood modeling (Green et al.,\n2021\n; Jefferson et al.,\n2017\n).\nConsequently, more hydrological studies are moving towards integrating a more process-based understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the urban water cycle components across the urban critical zone (Arden et al.,\n2014\n; Cristiano et al.,\n2020\n; Gillefalk et al.,\n2022\n; Salvadore et al.,\n2015\n). Studies investigating urban catchment hydrology have shown significantly lower water ages (Mean Transit Times – MTTs) and higher fractions of young water than non-urban catchment as a result of artificial storm drainage and reduced recharge and groundwater storage under impervious surfaces (Bonneau et al.,\n2018\n; Kuhlemann et al.,\n2022\n; Parajulee et al.,\n2019\n; Soulsby et al.,\n2015\n; Stevenson et al.,\n2022\n). Those impacts are likely to be time-variant as urban areas evolve (Birkel et al.,\n2012\n; Rodriguez et al.,\n2020\n). Such changes in urban flow paths and landscape connectivity can also impact water quality beyond storm runoff (Knapp et al.,\n2022\n; Zhi & Li,\n2020\n) and are also linked to hydroclimate and urbanization (Ferreira et al.,\n2021\n; Kuhlemann et al.,\n2022\n; Marx et al.,\n2023\n). Potential effects may include passive transport of pollutants along natural and anthropogenic flow paths, impacts of urban wastewater effluents, and incidents where storm drains are connected to foul sewers which can mix and spill in combined sewer overflows during rainfall events (Oswald et al.,\n2023\n; Paton & Haacke,\n2021\n).\nEcohydrological processes in urban green spaces have been investigated across scales, ranging from the street scale (Meili et al.,\n2020\n), to plot and sub-district level (Gillefalk et al.,\n2021\n,\n2022\n) for addressing soil water storage dynamics and evapotranspiration, and integrating specific urban effects on ecohydrological fluxes (Meili et al.,\n2020\n; Ring et al.,\n2023\n). Urban impacts on groundwater recharge have also been investigated. For example, Oiro et al., (\n2018\n,\n2020\n) quantified the temporal controls of the aquifer recharge and depletion of large-scale groundwater resources under the heavily depleted Nairobi aquifer system in Kenya. Other recent studies have aimed to quantify changes in subsurface water storage (Bhaskar et al.,\n2015\n,\n2016\n), how groundwater recharge and stream flow generation processes influence urban water quality (Welty et al.,\n2023\n), and street tree water uptake (Revelli & Porporato,\n2018\n). There remain significant challenges to integrating urban water balance components, changes in subsurface water storage, and stream flow generation processes into a “unified” urban model to address all potential hydrological processes (Oswald et al.,\n2023\n; Salvadore et al.,\n2015\n). Importantly, this needs to be done in such a way that is cognizant of historical management legacies that may continue to impact urban water.\nIn this study, our overall objective was to apply such an integrated approach to improve our understanding of a major urban water resource in a large city. For this, we selected the Wuhle catchment in eastern Berlin, Germany. The catchment drains an area of some 109 km\n2\nand is 56% urbanized, mostly focused in its lower reaches. It has a major role in connecting urban green spaces, allotments, and amenities used in one of the less affluent parts of the city. A long and ongoing history of water management continues to affect its current function. In the context of Berlin’s urban streams, it is unique in that its flow regime does not currently receive urban wastewater from either sewage treatment plants or sewer overflows (Kuhlemann et al.,\n2020\n; Möller & Burgschweiger,\n2008\n). The sewer and rainwater systems are generally separated, though some historic misconnections are likely (Geoportal Berlin / [Sewer System], 2017,\nhttps://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp\n). Preliminary work showed that the dominant stream flow generation processes reflect the interplay of urban storm drainage and local groundwater systems recharged through urban and peri-urban green spaces (Kuhlemann et al.,\n2022\n). However, the stream is also affected by local groundwater abstractions by the local water company, the\nBerliner Wasserbetriebe\n(BWB), and the more recent development of a network of urban flood control storage ponds.\nThe specific research aims were to:\n1.\nCharacterize the hydrology of the Wuhle catchment in terms of the interactions between hydroclimate, local groundwater systems, local water management systems, and the rainfall-runoff response.\n2.\nUse hydrological tracers, including stable water isotopes and a range of water quality parameters to assess the spatio-temporal variations in dominant water sources and flow paths.\n3.\nUse exploratory modeling in a learning framework to integrate these insights and understand what is known about the catchment’s response to a recent drought period, particularly concerning low flows.\nThe study also highlights some generic issues of the need for, and challenges to, future field data collection and modeling in urban catchments to provide evidence for future management in the face of climate change and increased urban growth.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy catchment\nThe Wuhle catchment is located in Germany, in the Berlin-Brandenburg area, spanning an area of ~ 109 km\n2\n(Fig.\n1\na). Its main channel network forms a small right-bank tributary of the river Spree, draining parts of the Barnim Plateau in the NE of Berlin (Fig.\n2\na). Its headwaters include natural topographic highs reaching 115 m and the Biesdorfer Heights, which are artificially elevated areas created by rubble removed from central Berlin after the Second World War.\nFig. 1\nMaps showing:\na\ncatchment location in the Berlin-Brandenburg area in Germany,\nb\nelevation, monitoring and sampling sites, and modeled sub-catchments,\nc\nland use, and\nd\npercentage of the catchment with impervious cover\nFull size image\nFig. 2\na\nDistribution of groundwater wells and water table elevations in the Wuhle catchment and\nb\nzoomed in on the lower catchment\nFull size image\nThe lower catchment forms part of the Warsaw-Berlin\nUrstromtal\n, a broad glacial valley (Fig.\n2\nb). This originated during the Weichselian glaciation which ended around 11,700 years ago (Litt et al.,\n2007\n). As the ice sheet melted, water flowed south, shaping the\nWuhletal\n(the Wuhle Valley), with a distinctive wide, gently sloping landscape. The upper reaches of the Wuhle Valley are located on top of the Barnim Plateau and are covered by ~ 40 m of silty, low permeability moraine, causing the underlying gravel aquifer to be confined (known as the AQ2 in Berlin) (Limberg & Thierbach,\n2002\n). Major tributaries of the Wuhle drain these headwaters. In the lower catchment, the gravel aquifer (known as AQ1.3 + 2) is unconfined, and the prevailing hydraulic gradient results in increased groundwater discharge to the stream in this area (Fig.\n2\n). The soils include glaciofluvial and windblown sands in the lower catchment and silty clay soils on glacial till in the upper catchment as well as areas of peat and lacustrine soils which form part of the corridors of urban green space fringing the river channel in the Wuhle Green Belt (Fig.\n1\nc).\nAs reported by Smith et al. (\n2023\n) for the neighboring Panke catchment, Berlin experiences a warm, temperate maritime climate (\nCfb\nin the Köppen classification). The average annual precipitation in the Wuhle catchment (2011–2020) was 590 mm, with frequent low-intensity winter precipitation and intense summer convective rainfall events yielding over 80 mm. Annual temperatures are moderate, averaging 10.3 °C, with seasonal monthly averages ranging from 1.2 °C in winter to 20 °C in summer. Recent protracted drought periods in Berlin and Brandenburg started in 2018 (Table\n1\n, Fig.\n3\n). These have resulted in low soil moisture levels in the summer, severely reduced groundwater recharge, and considerable vegetation stress across extensive areas (Haase & Hellwig,\n2022\n; Kleine et al.,\n2020\n; Smith et al.,\n2020\n). As a result, stream flow in the area is becoming increasingly seasonal and many headwater streams have stopped flowing in summer (Kleine et al.,\n2021\n).\nTable 1 Characterization of precipitation and stream flow components at the three gauging stations in the Wuhle catchment\nFull size table\nFig. 3\nDaily time series of precipitation and runoff (showing hydrograph separation with HydRun) in the\na\nupper catchment:\nAm Kienberg\n(base-10 log scale is used);\nb\nmiddle catchment:\nWuhletal\n; and\nc\nlower catchment:\nAm Bahndamm\nFull size image\nHuman occupation in the Wuhle valley goes back to the Paleolithic, with the earliest permanent settlements dating back to the thirteenth century when villages were founded and agriculture slowly intensified following extensive forest clearance (Geoportal Berlin / [Archeologic Sites], 2023,\nhttps://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp\n). Wetland drainage became widespread in Brandenburg in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries opening up new cultivation areas that had been intensively farmed in the twentieth century (Nützmann et al.,\n2000\n).\nBerlin’s growth in the nineteenth century also brought major sewage management problems and associated risks to public health. In the 1860s, the\nHobrechtsplan\nresulted in a canal system being developed to dispose of sewage and rainwater through infiltration and sewage field management (Hobrecht,\n1884\n). Part of this involved disrupting the natural flow of the Wuhle and led to enhanced discharge and localized flooding. Subsequent interventions to mitigate these problems involved deepening, straightening, and regular maintenance of the river channel network (Fig.\n1\na and b).\nFurther changes occurred with the construction of the Falkenberg sewage treatment plant in 1984 and the creation of its artificial clean water drainage channel, the Neue Wuhle, which flows along the Alte Wuhle and converges with it south of the\nWuhleteich\nin the middle catchment (Fig.\n1\nb). After the closure of the treatment plant in 2003 (Möller & Burgschweiger,\n2008\n), fears that the Wuhle would dry out sparked a significant catchment-wide restoration project, with the notable implementation of nature-based and technical solutions. Retention storage ponds were implemented as wetlands to capture high flows of the Wuhle. In 2014, 12 such ponds created an average potential storage capacity of 95,000 m\n3\n. More recently, four new ponds provided an additional storage volume of 27,700 m\n3\n(ARGE Wasser,\n2014\n). Additionally, groundwater abstractions from two water works may cause unintentional riverbank filtration; the maximum abstractions are currently of ~ 30.000 m\n3\n/d (equivalent ~ 0.7 m\n3\n/s) though the effects on the Wuhle are unknown.\nSimilar to other urban streams, wastewater management has evolved. In the north, formerly two sewage irrigation farms were operating – 1884/86 – 1969, treating in total ~ 70.000 m\n3\n/d (SenStadtUm,\n1992\n), replaced by a smaller wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), operating until 2003 (~ 7.300 m\n3\n/d) (Möller & Burgschweiger,\n2008\n). Some of the sewage irrigation farms were overbuilt with prefabricated buildings for housing. The discontinuation of the WWTP was expected to cause intermittent stream flow, decreasing groundwater levels in the Wuhle, and related endangerment of biotopes. Between 2006 and 2008, river restoration became more widespread (ARGE Wasser,\n2014\n). This included removing weirs, morphologic improvements to the riverbed and banks, restoration of contaminated soils, and construction and restoration of retention basins leading to the re-wetting of formerly dry biotopes, achieved by bypassing the Wuhle with a side channel and using both river and rainwater as water sources (ARGE Wasser,\n2014\n). Most of the sewer system is separated (Fig.\nS1\n), with wastewater being transported outside of the catchment, while rainwater either infiltrates locally as a result of low impact development (LID), notably including urban green spaces, or is routed to the streams via storm drains, attenuated in some areas by storage and/or retention structures (Geoportal Berlin / [Sewer System], 2017,\nhttps://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp\n).\nToday, the upper catchment in the State of Brandenburg remains mostly rural, the land being used for agriculture, with some patches of forest and wetland areas (Fig.\n1\nc, Table\nS1\n). The middle and lower catchments lay within Berlin’s city limits (ca. 57 km\n2\n) and are highly urbanized (Fig.\n1\nc), accounting for most of the impervious areas (Fig.\n1\nd). Approximately 14% of the catchment is sealed and connected to stormwater drains.\nDatasets\nMaps\nCatchment maps were produced in QGIS (version 3.28.7) based on publicly available official datasets (FIS-Broker / Geoportal, fbinter.stadt-berlin.de). The delineation of sub-catchments for the rainfall-runoff modeling (Fig.\n1\nb) was based on the micro-catchments defined by the\nLandesamt für Umwelt Brandenburg\n(LfU) and provided by the\nLandesvermessung und Geobasisinformation Brandenburg\n(LGB) (2012, revised in 2021). Topography (200-m resolution DTM), watercourses, and other major bodies of water were mapped based on the lakes and waterways network datasets provided by the same offices. Land use and vegetation characteristics, as well as the percentage of impervious areas, were mapped based on the Urban Atlas 2018 (European Environment Agency, Copernicus Land Monitoring Service).\nClimate and stream flow data\nClimatic datasets provided by the German Weather Service (DWD,\n2023\n) for the stations in and around the catchment were used to characterize weather conditions. For stream flow, the publicly available discharge datasets provided by the Berlin Senate Department of Environment, Transport and Climate Protection (SenUMVK,\n2022\n)—Am\nKienberg (Hellersdorfer Graben)\n,\nWuhletal\nand\nAm Bahndamm\ngauging stations (Fig.\n1\nb)—were used.\nWater chemistry, stable isotopes, and physical parameters\nThe stream water chemistry and stable water isotope datasets were analyzed for rain and stream waters at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in SE Berlin. Rainfall was sampled daily at IGB and stream water was sampled at weekly intervals at the\nAlte Försterei\nsampling station since 2019 for stable water isotopes and 2021 also for water quality parameters (Fig.\n1\nb). Groundwater samples were collected from several of the wells shown in Fig.\n2\nas part of a city-wide synoptic sampling campaign conducted in 2018 (Kuhlemann et al.,\n2020\n,\n2021\n). Synoptic surveys in 2022–2023 sampled the stream and 7 storm retention ponds.\nPhysicochemical parameters were measured during field sampling activities using a WTW MULTI 3630 IDS Set for pH (SenTix940, precision ± 0.0004), dissolved oxygen (DO; FDO925, precision ± 0.5% DO), temperature (precision ± 0.2 °C), and electrical conductivity (EC; TetraCon925, precision ± 0.5%). For the analysis of dissolved chloride (Cl\n−\n), nitrogen-nitrate (NO\n3\n−\n-N), and sulfate (SO\n4\n2−\n) water samples were collected in 2-mL Eppendorf tubes and analyzed by ion chromatography (Metrohm CompactIC, conductivity detection after chemical suppression). For dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), water was collected in 20-mL glass vials and analyzed with a Shimadzu TOC-L Total Organic Carbon Analyzer with an analytical precision of < 3% and for dissolved metals (Al, B, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Si) water was collected in 15-mL tubes, acidified with 150 µL of 2 M HCl and analyzed by inductively coupled-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific iCAP 6300).\nFor stable water isotope sampling, stream water was filtered through an acetate filter (0.22 µm cellulose acetate) into 1.5 mL vials (LLG Labware) on site. Daily precipitation isotope samples were collected in the east of Berlin at the IGB using an ISCO 3700 autosampler (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, USA). All water samples (stream and precipitation) were analyzed using Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy using a Picarro L2130i Isotopic Water Analyzer (Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The standards of the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were used for calibration. The analytical precision of liquid analyses had a standard deviation of 0.03‰ for δ\n18\nO and 0.13‰ for δ\n2\nH.\nStatistical analysis\nA composite dataset including all basic water quality and chemistry variables, as well as stable isotope data from all sampling campaigns, and available discharge data, were normalized in the form of standard scores before being subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA). A pairwise correlation analysis at a 99% confidence level was carried out for all water quality, isotope, and discharge variable pairs.\nHydrograph separation (HydRun)\nTime series of base flow for the three gauging stations in the catchment (Fig.\n1\nb) were produced using HydRun, a MATLAB-based package for event-based rainfall-runoff hydrograph analysis (Tang & Carey,\n2017\n). HydRun’s base flow separation method implements a recursive digital filter technique (Nathan & McMahon,\n1990\n). This technique decomposes high-frequency and low-frequency signals, commonly associated with storm flow and base flow, respectively (Arnold et al.,\n1995\n; Chapman,\n1999\n; Eckhardt & Arnold,\n2001\n; Nathan & McMahon,\n1990\n). The input includes stream flow and rainfall data, ideally of hourly or finer resolution, to match a precipitation event with the corresponding discharge response. HydRun produces base flow time series that are more realistic in comparison with conventional manual hydrograph separation methods (no zigzag behavior, as in works by Sloto & Crouse,\n1996\n; and Davie,\n2008\n).\nIn this study, we analyzed publicly available hourly discharge and precipitation data. We chose a filter coefficient of 0.995, as we found lower values to be ineffective in filtering out high-frequency runoff peaks. The filter was set to pass through the hydrograph 4 times. The resulting base flow and storm flow time series were used to estimate the Base Flow Index and the Storm Runoff Coefficient, respectively.\nEstimation of the Mean Transit Time (MTT) and the Young Water Fraction (YWF)\nTo characterize flow paths and associated transit times in the catchment, we estimated the Mean Transit Time (MTT) and the Young Water Fraction (YWF). The methodology employed in this study is an extension of preliminary research conducted in the same area but with a more extensive time series (Kuhlemann et al.,\n2022\n). The MTT represents the average time elapsed between the entry of a water molecule into a catchment (e.g., rainfall) and its exit from the catchment (Benettin et al.,\n2022\n). The calculation of the MTT involved the use of a lumped convolutional model based on the gamma distribution (McGuire & McDonnell,\n2006\n), a family of probability distributions that is versatile and requires the estimation of only two parameters:\nα\nand\nβ\n. The\nα\nparameter determines the shape of the distribution, capturing the effect of catchment characteristics such as soil cover and drainage density, which are associated with the fast runoff component in an urban catchment. The\nβ\nparameter scales the distribution, capturing long-term memory effects (Hrachowitz et al.,\n2010\n). This makes the gamma modeling approach a more parsimonious choice relative to dual reservoir models that involve an additional and often unidentifiable partitioning parameter, both of which have been successfully used to approximate Transit Time Distributions (TTDs) in urban catchments (Soulsby et al.,\n2014\n). In this study, optimal\nα\nand\nβ\nvalues were determined based on the maximization of the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) between measured and estimated stream oxygen-18 signals using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method.\nAdditionally, the YWF was estimated by first fitting a sinusoidal wave to both the stream water and the precipitation oxygen-18 data derived from collected water samples, and then calculating the ratio between the two (as in Kirchner,\n2016a\n,\n2016b\n). The Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) R script by Kirchner and Knapp (\n2020\n, version 1.4) was applied to enhance the robustness of fitting and mitigate the impact of outliers. In general, a relationship between the optimized MTT parameterization and the water age of the YWF can be established based on the shape parameter of the fitted gamma distribution, i.e., the\nα\nparameter. For instance, an optimized value of\nα\n= 0.5 signifies that “young water” is younger than 1.7 months;\nα\n= 1.0, that it is younger than 2.3 months; and\nα\n= 1.5, that it is younger than 2.7 months.\nRainfall-runoff modeling\nA semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model of the Wuhle catchment was implemented using the Hydrologic Engineering Center—Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS, Fig.\nS2\n), developed by the US Army Corps of Engineering for dendritic catchments (Feldman,\n2000\n). A detailed model description is included in the Supplementary Information (SI) section. Sub-catchments were delineated (Fig.\n1\nb) to make the best possible use of available discharge data from existing gauging stations (upper,\nAm Kienberg\n; middle,\nWuhletal\n; lower,\nAm Bahndamm\n) and stream isotope datasets (water sampled at sampling site\nAlte Försterei\n). The model was parameterized based on differences in regional land cover characteristics (Fig.\n1\nc–d). In such a relatively flat area overlying a regional aquifer, there is considerable uncertainty over the catchment area defined by a DTM and the contributions to stream flow from the underlying aquifer systems (Moore et al.,\n2020\n). Modeled sub-catchments were also delineated based on urban features such as highways and drainage ditches that modify natural catchment boundaries.\nModel calibration used a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) design to generate a near-random sample of 23 parameter values for each of the 11 sub-catchments from within plausible ranges based on prior work in the neighboring Panke catchment by Smith et al. (\n2023\n) (Table S2). A total of 150.000 simulations were carried out on Cirrus, a Linux-based High-Performance Computing Cluster at the Humboldt University in Berlin. The model was calibrated on the measured stream flow at gauging station\nAm Bahndamm\n, and optimized on NSE using 12 hourly time steps. The latter was a compromise based on the need to capture both short (sub-daily) and long (~ decadal) response timescales with computational efficiency.\nIsotope datasets were used as an independent auxiliary measure to test the realism of the models in terms of flow path partitioning via an additional isotope mixing model (Figure\nS1\nb). Mixing of stable isotopes (δ\n2\nH and δ\n18\nO) and water ages were computed for the fluxes and storages from calibrated HEC-HMS results. Additional effects of passive storage on damping the isotopic dynamics were incorporated using an amount-weighted approach (as in Smith et al.,\n2023\n), assuming a complete and uniform mixing for each time step as with other isotopic modeling approaches (Ala-Aho et al.,\n2017\n; Kuppel et al.,\n2018\n). At the end of each time step, one time step was added to each average water age in storage to account for the aging of water. Because in-stream evaporative fractionation is negligible in Berlin (see results for the Panke stream by Smith et al.,\n2023\n), these effects were not considered within the isotope mixing module.\nResults\nHydrological dynamics\nFigure\n3\nshows the time series of precipitation and stream flow for the three gauging sites on the Wuhle between 2004 and 2022, and the decomposition of stream flow into its base flow and storm flow components. This period saw marked variability in annual precipitation ranging from 461 mm in 2022 to 810 mm in 2007 (Table\n1\n). In common with the rest of Berlin and Brandenburg, most years since 2017 have seen rainfall deficits compared to the long-term average. Most rainfall was low in intensity (typically < 10 mm/d) with the heaviest rain (> 20 mm/d) mostly restricted to convectional storms in the summer.\nThe Wuhle is a “flashy” stream and was highly responsive to significant rainfall events during the study period, consistent with the effects of urban storm drainage from impervious surfaces. This flashiness increased downstream as the urban area became more extensive (Table\n1\n, Fig.\n3\n). However, the multiple flood storage ponds in the catchment mitigated runoff peaks when antecedent storage was available, so runoff peaks did not necessarily increase proportionately to rainfall inputs. Moreover, most of the highest flows tended to be in response to summer convectional storms.\nDespite the flashy runoff regime, evapotranspiration accounted for 80–90% of rainfall and base flows were the dominant component of stream flow in terms of runoff volumes in the lower catchment (Table\n1\n). Annual runoff coefficients were low; ranging from < 5% in the upper catchment to ~ 10–20% in the lower catchment (Table\n1\n). This likely reflects greater evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge, and less direct storm runoff in the upper non-urban catchment. Annual runoff has been exceptionally low at each gauging point since the drought of 2018 (~ 50% of the annual mean of previous years on record).\nThe base flow components of annual runoff also increased downstream with the BFI typically increasing from <  ~ 0.2 in the upper catchment, to ~ 0.2–0.4 in the mid-catchment, to 0.4–0.6 in the lower catchment (Table\n1\n). Seasonally varying groundwater inputs in the lower catchment were apparent and the groundwater component of base flow has likely been decreasing since 2017 in response to the drought years.\nThese temporal dynamics and recent changes in the flow regime were consistent with a general response to regional groundwater levels. The time series of individual wells in the confined AQ2 aquifer in and around the northern part of the Wuhle catchment and the unconfined AQ2 aquifer in the south are presented in Fig.\n4\na and b. While the water table is closer to the surface in most wells in the unconfined aquifer in the south, there is variation in depth to the water table depending on locations. However, most wells displayed clear seasonality of late winter peaks and late summer minima. The effects of the wetter years of 2007, 2010–11, and 2017 on groundwater levels were also apparent. Most wells exhibited a gradual decrease since the wet years of 2010 and 2011, with a marked decline since 2017/18. These patterns are clearer when the annual average change in water table level is estimated for each year consistent with a direct link between climatically driven reduced recharge, lowering water tables, and a decrease in stream base flows (Fig.\n4\n).\nFig. 4\nGroundwater levels in the wells located in\na\nthe confined (North AQ2) and\nb\nunconfined (South AQ2) aquifers of the Wuhle Valley; and the average and cumulative annual changes in groundwater levels in\nc\nthe North AQ2 and\nd\nthe South AQ2\nFull size image\nDynamics of stable water isotopes\nStable isotopes of water in precipitation close to the Wuhle catchment (~ 5 km) showed marked variability (Fig.\n5\n). Much of this is related to seasonality, with rainfall that is more enriched in heavy isotopes in summer and more depleted in winter. Nevertheless, within seasons, day-to-day variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall was also marked and, in summer convective events, samples were enriched in heavy isotopes that plotted below the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) indicating atmospheric recycling of moisture (Fig.\n5\n).\nFig. 5\nDual isotope plot showing deuterium (δ\n2\nH) and oxygen-18 (δ\n18\nO) ratios in precipitation, stream, pond, and groundwater samples collected in the Wuhle catchment\nFull size image\nIsotopic variability in stream water was highly damped compared to rainfall (Fig.\n5\n). The average composition was close to that of groundwater, though groundwater was more stable and isotope ratios more negative, consistent with the predominance of winter recharge (Fig.\n6\n). During high flow events, the stream water isotopic signal tended to move in the direction of recent rainfall, though the effect was most pronounced in larger, more intense events (Fig.\n6\n). This would be consistent with the effects of urban storm drains routing rainfall rapidly into streams. However, the effects were non-linear depending on the role of urban storm retention ponds, some of which are operated via weirs and return water into the stream when certain storage thresholds are surpassed.\nFig. 6\nTime series of δ\n18\nO in rainfall (\nIGB\n) and runoff (\nAlte Försterei\n), measured precipitation (\nBuch\n), and gauged discharge Q (\nAm Bahndamm\n) showing fitted estimates for the Wuhle catchment of\na\nthe Young Water Fraction (YWF), and\nb\nthe Mean Transit Time (MTT)\nFull size image\nDespite the relatively coarse weekly sampling, overall estimates of the YWF produced by the isotope-based regression model (Fig.\n6\na) were around 20% and consistent between years. From the limited direct influence of storm runoff, we infer that isotopically well-mixed groundwater provided the dominant source of stream flow over the study period. This isotope-based analysis also supported the hydrometric analysis (Fig.\n3\n), which indicated that the high base flow component was sustained by groundwater explaining the relatively low runoff coefficients at both the annual and storm event scale.\nThe MTT of the stream derived from fitting a gamma function to the rainfall-runoff isotope time series was ~ 1.1 years, with an optimized alpha value of 0.41. This, in the context of the YWF, again implies contributions of older groundwater water in the long tail of the travel time distribution. Sampling of some of the storage ponds indicated evaporative effects in water retained in off-line storage though effects on stream isotopes were not detected.\nWater quality dynamics\nTable\n2\nsummarizes the hydro-chemical characteristics of the Wuhle stream at the catchment outlet. The stream was mildly alkaline with a mean pH of 7.7 and a high solute load indexed by its high electrical conductivity (~ 823 ± 108 µS cm\n−1\n). The stream had, at times, elevated levels of typical urban pollutants such as P, B, and Cl (max values were 0.22, 0.02, and 152.8 mg L\n−1\n, respectively), though overall levels of many pollutants such as NO\n3\n-N were low (0.33 ± 0.20 mg L\n−1\n). This is consistent with the dominance of groundwater with a long residence time, as demonstrated by the major ion chemistry, which is summarized in a Piper plot in Fig.\n7\n. Like groundwater (Fig.\n7\na), the stream (Fig.\n7\nb) was predominantly dominated by HCO\n3\n–\nand Ca\n2+\nions. The stream network samples had less heterogeneity (higher spread of points in Fig.\n7\na than in Fig.\n7\nb) and only limited spatial variability in chemical composition compared to that of groundwater samples (less overlap between North and South polygons in Fig.\n7\nb relative to Fig.\n7\na). The variability in groundwater composition is particularly high in the unconfined aquifer south of the catchment (higher spread of points and larger polygons in Fig.\n7\na than in Fig.\n7\nb), where shallow groundwater is vulnerable to surface sources of pollution (e.g., from road salts). Consequently, SO\n4\n2–\nand Cl\n–\nbecame more important anions downstream.\nTable 2 Summary of WQ parameters. Mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values (2021–2023)\nFull size table\nFig. 7\nMajor ion chemistry of\na\ngroundwater; and\nb\nstream flow in the Wuhle catchment plotted as Piper diagrams\nFull size image\nIn addition to the stream and groundwater, the Piper diagram incorporates data from other surface waters such as storm detention ponds and ditches, e.g., the Hellersdorfer Graben (HG), which drains the sub-catchment SC7 (Fig.\n1\nb). In some cases, these differed substantially from the northern-confined aquifer, as detention ponds most likely reflect the influence of rainfall rather than groundwater. In terms of flow-related variability, pH tends to be higher in summer, with higher flow events associated with slight depressions in pH (Fig.\n8\n). This dilution in events is more pronounced for electrical conductivity (EC), consistent with the isotopic data that indicates a shift between stream flow being dominated by more concentrated groundwater and more diluted rainfall. Stream water temperature and O\n2\nshowed similar seasonal patterns, as expected, given the effect of temperature on the solubility of O\n2\n. However, it is notable that O\n2\nlevels are low for prolonged periods during the summer.\nFig. 8\nBasic water quality parameters in weekly samples of the Wuhle stream (\nAlte Försterei\n):\na\npH;\nb\nelectrical conductivity (EC);\nc\ndissolved oxygen; and\nd\ntemperature\nFull size image\nThe water quality data are plotted as a PCA in Fig.\n9\n. As reflected in Fig.\n8\n, flow had a strong influence on many water quality parameters as a direct consequence of dilution. Accordingly, metrics of stream flow showed strong positive loadings on axis 1 of the PCA. Dissolved O\n2\n, NO\n3\n–\n-N, Zn, and Mn also showed similar loadings, consistent with increased concentrations as flows increase. In contrast, strong negative loadings on EC, base cations, DIC, and SO\n4\n2–\nwere consistent with decreased concentrations at higher flows.\nFig. 9\nPrincipal components analysis of Wuhle stream water chemistry with individual measurements and samples collected at sampling site\nAlte Försterei\n(2021–2023) and classed according to season\nFull size image\nThe influence of seasonality was evident in the positive loadings on temperature, which aligned with increased isotope ratios, P, and Fe. In contrast, Na\n+\nand Cl\n–\nshowed negative loadings on axis 2, indicating different controls likely reflecting winter contamination from road salts.\nRainfall-runoff modeling\nHEC-HMS was calibrated to the catchment outflow to simulate runoff. The overall water balance of the catchment was captured, with higher annual ET and groundwater recharge from non-urban areas (Fig.\n10\na–b) which aligned with the increasing runoff coefficients downstream (Table\n1\n). Interannual differences in ET and recharge also broadly captured the effects of the recent drought years. However, while the calibration of the model according to different efficiency statistics could produce a reasonable simulation of either flood peaks or base flows; balanced calibration of the model to adequately simulate both was only partly successful (Fig.\n11\n). Such a “balanced” model tended to overpredict the largest peak flows (typically by 20–30%) and underpredict the lowest base flows, and it only yielded modest performance statistics from conventional objective functions, as well as overarching uncertainty over the actual catchment area. This likely reflects the combined effects of underpredicted infiltration due to the underestimation of surface storage in natural terrain depressions and water retention ponds, as well as their role in truncating peak runoff. Moreover, although the non-stationary influence of hydroclimate on annual base flows was captured similarly to the hydrograph separation method, flows were generally overestimated (Fig.\n12\n) and the partitioning of runoff pathways was unable to reproduce the stream isotope signal (shown in Fig.\n6\n), indicating insufficient incorporation of storage and mixing (Fig. S3).\nFig. 10\nModeled daily evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge for the\nA\nurban (SC2); and\nB\nrural (SC7) areas within the model domain\nFull size image\nFig. 11\nSimulated and observed discharge at\nAm Bahndamm\n(lower catchment) with uncertainty bands.

While groundwater recharge can increase in an urban environment where leaking pipes and sewer systems can replenish groundwater (Lerner,\n1990\n,\n2002\n; Minnig et al.,\n2018\n), sealed surfaces and urban drainage more generally decrease recharge. In addition, urban green spaces ecohydrologically partition water between evapotranspiration losses (that can contribute to off-setting the urban heat island effect from latent heat transfers) and groundwater recharge (that retains water in the urban environment and can enhance stream flows) (Gillefalk et al.,\n2021\n). These complex interactions, including storm drainage from sealed surfaces, commonly cause urban streams to more frequently exceed extreme low or high flow thresholds (Debbage & Shepherd,\n2018\n), though, in some cases, enhanced low flow conditions can occur (Chu et al.,\n2013\n). These sometimes-contradictory impacts resulting from interactions between the two “natural” and “artificial” flow systems in cities are poorly understood and are yet increasingly important for the management of urban water resources (Oswald et al.,\n2023\n). Such contradictions likely reflect the wide range of potential impacts that result from geographical differences in environmental conditions (climate, geology, topography, etc.) and the precise characteristics of the built environment (history, density, engineered infrastructure, proportion of green spaces, etc.) in contrasting urban settings.\nWhile traditional urban hydrology focused on providing an evidence base for planning and managing urban drainage and flood alleviation, understanding recharge and generation of base flows are increasingly important in the face of challenges posed by climate change such as drier, warmer catchments. These challenges are becoming a reality and forcing a major rethinking of water management strategies in Berlin and other cities (Creutzfeld et al.,\n2021\n; SenUMVK,\n2022\n). The hydrometric, isotopic, and hydro-chemical data from the Wuhle show the complementary effects of these interactions between more “natural” and engineered hydrological systems. Concerning our first specific research aim of characterizing the hydrology of the Wuhle, we have identified base flows in the catchment to be groundwater-dominated; the seasonal base flow component of the stream is synchronous with the annual cycle of groundwater recharge in winter and summer drawdown. Moreover, the long-term groundwater responses correlate well with non-stationarity in the stream base flow component. This is evident in the groundwater/stream flow highs in the wet 2009–2011 period, as well as in 2017, and the drier 2012–2016 and 2018–2022 periods. Regarding our second specific research aim of using isotopic, water quality, and hydrometric data, we have seen that its integrated interpretation supports these findings, mirroring the strong groundwater dominance in non-urban streams draining similar but rural catchments elsewhere in the German State of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin (Smith et al.,\n2021\n). Such groundwater is predominantly derived from unconfined aquifers and is relatively young. Recent tritium-based dating yields average base flow age estimates of around 5 years (Ying et al.,\n2024\n); this is of a similar order of magnitude to the MTT-derived ages of > 1 year, particularly when considering that this includes the influence of a 20% new water fraction, mainly derived from urban storm drains. These shallow groundwater influences contrast with those of the much older water in the deeper aquifer systems that are prevalent in Berlin-Brandenburg (Bednorz & Brose,\n2017\n; Massmann et al.,\n2009\n). As in other parts of the world, it seems that these older waters have only limited influence on surface waters (Jasechko et al.,\n2016\n).\nThe new water fraction generates a storm response of individual events that is superimposed on the seasonal variation in base flows, with the highest peak flows tending to cluster in the wettest years (e.g., 2011 and 2017). Nevertheless, the evolution and operation of the network of runoff detention ponds had a non-stationary effect on storm runoff over the studied period, as more ponds have been added over time and their effectiveness and impact depend on how antecedent conditions and the sequencing of rainfall events fills the storage capacity. This highlights the importance of the memory effects of past management practices and the piecemeal, fragmented evolution of cumulative effects from contemporary management (e.g., Golden & Hoghooghi,\n2018\n), information that should ideally be readily available but is often hidden in grey literature and archives.\nThis combination of separated urban storm drainage and groundwater inputs explains why the stream was usually relatively low in typical urban pollutants such as NO\n3\n–\n-N, P, and B due to the absence of continuous inputs of treated sewage following the closure of WWTPs in the catchment. The interaction between storm runoff and groundwater resulted in many solutes showing strong dilution with discharge increases. Despite the relatively low nutrient levels, the stream shows strong evidence of low oxygen concentrations in the summer, indicating both temperature effects and high ecosystem respiration. This is of particular concern, as the problem is likely to exacerbate with climate change, and the anticipated increased temperatures and lower summer flows have been recently shown to be causing global trends in increased stream anoxia (Zhi et al.,\n2023\n).\nChallenges to modeling\nTraditional urban rainfall-runoff models remain useful tools for simulating the effects of urban storm drains and flood prediction (e.g., El Alfy,\n2016\n; Ramly & Tahir,\n2016\n). Usually, in such cases, a simplified representation of groundwater is not problematic as it represents only a minor component of flood flows. However, where predictions of low flows and their vulnerability to climate change are equally important to close the long-term water balance, alternative modeling tools are needed. One such alternative is using ensemble modeling approaches with either different models or different sets of calibrated parameters for the same model, providing a way to separately address these contrasting and increasingly important applied problems (e.g., Kobayashi et al.,\n2023\n; Nourani et al.,\n2021\n). Even so, if a more integrated understanding of urban hydrological systems is needed, then more sophisticated process-based modeling may be required, with a more explicit representation of drainage systems and groundwater processes. This is particularly the case when management interventions and land use change predictions are affecting both high flows and low flows.\nIn this study, our third specific research aim was to use exploratory modeling as a learning framework and to integrate our insights about the catchment’s response. In this regard, and despite its recent successful application in the Panke catchment in Berlin (Smith et al.,\n2023\n), we have seen that successfully calibrating HEC-HMS to the Wuhle proved to be difficult in a way that both storm flow and base flow components could be adequately captured. This likely reflects uncertainties over catchment size and any related interactions between the upper AQ2 aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the Wuhle stream network and the larger regional aquifer system (Limberg & Thierbach,\n2002\n). Furthermore, potential groundwater abstraction via riverbank filtration from the Wuhle and the time-variant nature of the operation of storm water storage in detention ponds cannot be captured with the relatively simple modeling framework used here. These interactions may also have time-variant effects during drought periods. To capture such effects, a fully distributed process-based model of groundwater-surface water interactions may be needed such as PARFLOW or HydroGeoSphere (e.g., Bhaskar et al.,\n2015\n). However, such modeling would also need to be integrated with the capabilities of models such as SWMM (Rossman & Simon,\n2022\n) and MIKE + (DHI,\n2024\n) to parameterize the effects of non-stationarity in the management of the catchment, with increasing use of flood storage retention ponds in sustainable urban drainage, as well as local effects of groundwater pumping. This would also benefit from the storm drainage network being directly parameterized when such information is available (e.g., Ariano & Oswald,\n2022\n).\nA major challenge will be integrating algorithms for the different time dynamics of highly responsive urban streams (which respond to rainfall in minutes) and the slower (annual to decadal) changes in underlying aquifers. Indeed, the 12-h modeling step used in this study may have been a decision that compromised both high and flow simulation. Even with the best models derived in this study, the failure to simulate isotopes in stream flow indicates that process representation in the rainfall-runoff transformation is not adequately capturing the mixing of fluxes with catchment storage. This difference to the relative success of Smith et al. (\n2023\n) in modeling in the Panke is likely attributable to the fact that there around 90% of the flows are regulated and therefore any uncertainties over groundwater-surface water interactions had only minor effects on model results. This is not the case in the Wuhle catchment.\nFuture needs\nGlobally, pressures on urban streams like the Wuhle will increase in the coming decades. The dual threats of climate change and urban expansion are likely to reduce the availability of water in urban areas. Despite this, societal demands increasingly highlight the importance of urban green/blue spaces for amenity, health, and biodiversity benefits in built-up environments (Braubach et al.,\n2017\n; Foster et al.,\n2011\n; Gunawardena et al.,\n2017\n). In the Berlin-Brandenburg area, there is compelling evidence that lower rainfall and higher evapotranspiration are causing streams to become increasingly intermittent (Kleine et al.,\n2021\n). This is because reduced groundwater recharge weakens groundwater-surface water connectivity and increases the frequency and longevity of low flow periods (Smith et al.,\n2021\n). Maintaining urban river corridors as important green/blue spaces for esthetic, recreational, and biodiversity goals is likely to require management changes that reduce water abstractions and/or increase regulation from water imports (Foster et al.,\n2011\n; Oswald et al.,\n2023\n). Historically, in Berlin, this has been achieved by using treated wastewater effluent; the neighboring Panke and Erpe catchments are both mostly sustained by wastewater (Kuhlemann et al.,\n2022\n). However, while this wastewater supplements flow, it can also lead to the deterioration of water quality in a way that impacts the in-stream ecology (Warter et al.,\n2024\n). Additional benefits may come from the ongoing disconnection of existing urban drainage schemes in Berlin as older urban areas are re-developed and the use of sustainable urban drainage increases recharge.\nAs with other cities, future management will require a fuller knowledge of urban water courses and how regulated flows interact with hydrological flow paths in urban green spaces and the rural parts of peri-urban catchments. This will require better data and better models that can integrate engineered components and more natural areas. Such information will be fundamental to provide an evidence base for improved management. In this regard, recent intensification in scientific monitoring efforts through the investigation of urban critical zones is to be welcomed (Arora et al.,\n2023\n; Ring et al.,\n2023\n). However, regardless of a better understanding, climate change makes the threat of greater intermittent flows more likely in Berlin. It is thus likely that hard choices will have to be made between either maintaining urban streams more perennial through flow regulation or allowing them to dry out more frequently in summer, with implications for urban riparian environments.\nConclusions\nIn this work, we have explored the complex hydrological dynamics of the Wuhle stream and its catchment in the Berlin-Brandenburg area through integrated synthesis, analysis of data, and semi-distributed process-based rainfall-runoff modeling. This was achieved via the integration of multiple datasets, including pre-existing data produced by public offices (e.g., landscape characteristics, hydrometric, and meteorological data), and new water quality and stable isotope data. The interpretation of this data was aided by output from statistical analysis (PCA), estimation of the Young Water Fraction (YWF) and the Mean Transit Time (MTT), a filter-based hydrograph separation (HydRun), and a semi-distributed, process-based rainfall-runoff model (HEC-HMS). The results highlighted the complexity of urban hydrology in large evolving cities, where the subtle interactions between natural and engineered systems may lead to hydrological responses that are hard to disentangle given the heterogeneity of urban landscapes.\nLooking ahead, mitigation of growing pressures on urban streams warrants a re-evaluation of water management strategies. These will play a critical role, especially in the context of urban expansion and climate change, under which altered precipitation, infiltration, and evapotranspiration patterns are to be expected. One reason for this is that fast-draining urban catchments suffer from reduced groundwater recharge below sealed surfaces, which is especially exacerbated by drought periods. Because groundwater processes are crucial for streams like the Wuhle, the increasing intermittency of such streams raises concerns about the sustainability of urban river corridors and underscores the importance of informed decision-making in managing water resources.\nThe complex hydrological response of this catchment and the limited readily available data on the cumulative effects of the evolution of water management, together with the modest success of a traditional, semi-distributed, process-based rainfall-runoff model (HEC-HMS), highlighted the need for more advanced data-driven models. These should be ideally equipped to deal with non-stationarity, with a sophisticated representation of urban groundwater to simultaneously address the impacts of management interventions and land use changes on both high and low flows. To successfully calibrate and validate such models, continuous and sustained monitoring of urban streams will remain essential and help to achieve the goal of maintaining the ecological balance while at the same time satisfying basic human needs and providing a range of ecosystem services.\nData availability\nStable isotope and water physio-chemistry data have been produced by our research group and can be provided upon request.\nReferences\nAla-Aho, P., Tetzlaff, D., McNamara, J.

        "abstract": "Major public health and safety events that occur on a global scale have the potential to drastically alter the lifestyle of individuals residing in urban areas. These events can introduce changes that may negatively impact their overall well⁃being. In order to study the changes in residents′ demand for urban green space (UGS) types and their ecosystem services (ES), with the aim of enabling urban residents to benefit more from UGS when major public health events occur, this paper used questionnaire survey data, statistical analysis methods such as Kruskal⁃Wallis test, cluster analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of urban residents′ demand for UGS types and their ES during the early, middle, and late periods of the COVID⁃ 19 pandemic. The results showed that: ① As the progression of time unfolded, there was a noticeable decrease in the disparity of residents′ demand for the same category of UGS and ES within identical time frames. During the early and middle phases of the epidemic, the types of UGS that residents most strongly desired were those of attached green spaces and park green spaces. Conversely, the types of UGS that garnered the least amount of demand were regional green spaces. In the early phase of the epidemic, there was a generally robust demand from residents for ES. The ES that were most demanded during the early and middle stages were those that contributed to the beautification of the city and provided a means for relaxation of the body and mind. In the late period, the types of UGS with the strongest demand and the smallest demand are attached green space and park green space respectively. ② The degree of spatial evolution pertaining to residents′ demand for various types of UGS was observed to be greater than that of the demand for ES across all three periods under consideration. ③ There was a pronounced spatial heterogeneity in the demand from residents for UGS and their corresponding ES. The majority of these demands were distributed randomly. However, in the late period, the demand for four specific types of UGS exhibited a pattern of agglomeration. These demands were primarily concentrated in the Beijing⁃Tianjin⁃Hebei region, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Shandong Province. The outcomes of this study have the potential to offer substantial scientific backing for the strategic planning and sustainable utilization of UGS and ES. This is particularly relevant in the context of future significant public health incidents. The ultimate objective of these efforts is to enhance the protection and promotion of the well⁃being and quality of life of urban residents.",

It serves to provide multiple functions as it gives the natural features environment that influences every aspect of our lives. The urban green space is observed as the visible element for people to recognize the landscape structure of a cityscape [\n26\n]. Dunnet et al. [\n15\n] defined urban green space as land that consists predominantly of unsealed, permeable, ‘soft’ surfaces such as soil, grass, shrubs, and trees with the emphasis on the ‘predominant’ character since green spaces may also include buildings and hard surfaced areas. It includes all areas of parks, play areas and other green spaces specifically intended for recreational use, as well as other green spaces with other origins. The World Health Organization [\n52\n] defined urban green spaces as places with ‘natural surfaces’ or ‘natural settings’ which are public parks and including ‘blue space’ that represents water elements such as ponds. In general, green space occupies 25–30% of the urban land use and is part of the element that influenced the urban features [\n47\n].\nMany studies have presently pointed urban green space as a resource to balance the urban growth with its enormous benefit to the urban environment [\n9\n,\n12\n,\n14\n,\n18\n,\n22\n,\n32\n,\n36\n,\n38\n]. These studies have explored the correlation between green spaces and quality of life from environmental, social and economic perspectives. Their significance as an important resource which provides direct and indirect benefits to ecosystem services and improves physical, psychological, emotional, social and material wellbeing. In addition, past researches have revealed that urban green space representing part of urban nature fulfills the important of immaterial human needs in terms of emotional, psychological, social and economic benefits [\n7\n,\n19\n].\nUrban green space specifically refers to “public open space” or “public park” in an urban setting. The word “park” is frequently used in connection with urban green space as it is an area of land mostly provided for recreation and promotes physical and social interaction within the community. A “public park” covers public playground, public/community recreation center or area, and other public areas, created, established, designated, maintained, provided or set aside by the town authority, for the purposes of public rest, play, recreation, enjoyment or assembly, and all buildings, facilities and structures located thereon or therein [\n50\n].\nThe trends for public parks have been part of the performance indicators in human development [\n16\n]. There is a need to determine the significant characteristics of how urban green features were associated with park visitors and responsive to the needs of the local community as well as part of sustainable urban landscapes. It is possible to investigate the physical features of urban green space and its contribution to the users’ active and passive activities and their functional attachment to the park. Hence, it is important to understand urban green space features attribute to ensure parks are designed to maximize opportunities for people across a range of demographic groups engaged with various activities. It is important to understand how green space provides meaningful experiences to urban residents and certain physical features of green space can promote the development of Sense of Place and improve users’ experiences in the green space [\n29\n].\nGreen space features have the restorative ability and create positive experiences within both natural and built environment. The feature attributes of parks such as size, design, usage, location, and activities are the main decisive factors that determine the satisfaction level of the users or community. The effectiveness or sustainability of recreational parks can be measured by prioritizing the features of urban green space using specific decision-making model. For that reason, this study explores and attempt to relate how the attributes of green space feature affect physical activity patterns, perceptions, and preferences of the park users.\nThis paper relates the problem associated with the status of urban green space in the Ipoh city, Malaysia. The increasing urban climate change has made the development in Ipoh city coherent with other cities in Malaysia. Hence, the changes in the physical environment have led to associated changes in the aspirations and demands upon existing green spaces [\n24\n]. It has been the intentions of the Ipoh City Council to create a green and safe city concept viz. ‘Quality living that provides the urban residents with physical facilities and better amenities including good recreation areas, social activities, and health’.\nThe two urban public parks selected in the case study were the favorite outing destination among the locals and represents the family parks that attracts hundreds of people daily. The study is intended to identify the design attributes of the parks that will be sustainable for the people’s choice. It examines how urban green space features meet the purposes and needs of urban residents by determining the effectiveness and patterns of green space based on standard criteria that measure their quality.\n2\nMethodology\nThe study area is two prominent recreational parks situated in the heart of Ipoh city of Perak, Northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. It is popularly known as the Bougainvillea City referring its famous flower symbol and the fourth biggest in Malaysia covering 643 km\n2\nwith over 750,000 inhabitants. It is surrounded by beautiful limestone outcrops with wonderful cave temples. The city is one of the fascinating tourist destinations in the Peninsular of Malaysia, famous with heritages, cultures, and natures. Two prominent recreational parks i.e. King Abdul Aziz Recreational Park (Park A) and D. R. Seenivasagam Recreational Park (Park B) in the heart of Ipoh city was chosen as the study area (Fig.\n1\n). The parks (study area) are abundant with greenery and attractions and popularly known as the oasis within Ipoh’s city life. Each park has its own significant character that attracts users.\nFig. 1\nIpoh city and the urban green spaces (recreational parks)\nFull size image\nThe indicators to measure the green space features were acquired from comparative works of literature that reviews the attributes affecting urban green space. A summary of commonly used quality measurement of urban green space/parks was identified and proposed as the framework indicators in establishing the basis of green space measurement (Table\n1\n). These common feature attributes were identified as:\nTable 1 Common adopted feature attributes of green space in the works of literature\nFull size table\n1.\nNatural Setting\n—Visual scenery with unique values that enhances the character of an area that gives users attractiveness, sense of being away from their usual setting, sense of fascination, happiness, leisure, spirituality, affection, and balance of sun and shade.\n2.\nDesign\n—Provides the diversity of activities offered and variety in the form, color, and texture of landscape elements which includes the presence of walking paths, shade, water features, birdlife, lighting, sporting facilities, and playgrounds.\n3.\nLocation\n—Visibleness and identifiable of the park which is located close to major public transport routes that are easily accessible and not isolated.\n4.\nFacilities\n—Built features within parks that create opportunities to engage in specific games and activities.\n5.\nAmenities\n—Supporting facilities that are identified as important characteristics in the park. It represents the equipment or services that are provided in parks.\n6.\nAccessibility\n—Gives an opportunity for movement through the park environment physically and visually.\n7.\nWater Element\n—Attributes of visual amenity that gives design integrity and enhances the natural elements within the surrounding environment.\n8.\nSafety\n—Safe green space and recreation facilities are the key to community wellness and have a direct relationship to their usage rate.\n9.\nMaintenance\n—Crucial to ensuring areas are attractive and well-kept for the enjoyment of both residents and visitors.\n2.1\nQualitative Assessment-Usage Pattern of Public Green Space\nThe qualitative assessment adopts the preference analysis that involves direct interviews with park visitors using questionnaires via a series of interviews and thorough observation over both study area. The public perception towards green space area was evaluated to determine what users want from urban green spaces and the extent to which the urban green spaces meet their expectations. The survey was administrated over a month period with a total number of 200 respondents (100 from each park). The questionnaire was designed to comprise the dependent variables, such as their gender, age range, the time frame of travel, mode of transport, and the frequency of visit, the independent variables such as the safety, and security. In comprehending the design qualities, the social attributes that encourage social mingling (i.e. personal information and social preference) and green space properties (i.e. green space design character and attributes features) were measured through documented responses (Fig.\n2\n). The green inventories were carried out to map the characteristics of green spaces (parks). They were observed during weekdays, weekend and public holidays to capture the different usage patterns of different times of day (morning and evening) and on different days of the week. The unit of analysis of the target group is the age group range of the urban park visitors/users.\nFig. 2\nThe classified categories of green space variables measured\nFull size image\nThe frequencies analysis was analyzed using the SPSS statistical software to determine the usage pattern of public green spaces in relation to the design characteristics and user’ visit frequencies. Table\n2\ngives an overview of the number of users involved in activities for both parks. Trip characteristics and park activities (e.g. travel distance, length of stay, the frequency of visits, mode of transport, and perception of safety, aesthetics quality and facilities) were analyzed to see the trend of the visitors’ preferences.\nTable 2 Descriptive statistic of people involved in the activities within green space settings\nFull size table\n2.2\nAHP-Pairwise Decision Making\nThe decision problem was structured in a hierarchy where the overall goal of the decision is to prioritize nine (9) common features of urban green space. The pairwise questionnaires were distributed to twenty (20) decision makers (DM) who are professionals indirectly or directly involved in green space planning from the institution of higher learning (IHL), senior officers the local municipality and the state planning agency. The questionnaire allows decision makers to make pairwise comparisons between criteria (green space features). It measures the relative importance between two criteria in a subsequent manner based on the continuous AHP 9-point scale i.e. ranging from the scale (1) ‘equal importance’ to the scale (9) ‘extremely important’ [\n46\n,\n45\n].\nThe AHP-Excel\n®\nTemplate tool [\n30\n] was used in the decision-making processes. The software template derives ratio scales from paired comparisons of criteria and allows for some small inconsistencies in judgments. Inputs can be actual measurements or subjective opinions. The output form will be priorities (weightings) and a consistency ratio that was mathematically calculated using the solution of an eigenvalue problem [\n30\n]. The pair-wise comparisons results are arranged in a matrix. The first (dominant) normalized right eigenvector of the matrix gives the ratio scale (weighting), the eigenvalue determines the consistency ratio. A sample input summary of one decision maker (DM1) is provided in Table\n3\n. The AHP decision model measured the effectiveness of the present recreation areas by prioritizing urban green space features. The relative preference of decision makers towards criteria affecting the design of green space feature is presented as the preference weight.\nTable 3 Sample pairwise comparison of one decision maker (DM1)\nFull size table\n3\nResults and Discussion\n3.1\nDerived Maps of Green Space Features\nPark A (King Abdul Aziz) accommodates attractive green urban space features. This community park has remarkable values in terms of environment and human health as well as the economy for the city. Almost 70% of the park is covered by the majestic rain trees and natural surroundings. The resultant 7 reclassified features of the park are highlighted in Fig.\n3\n. Table\n4\ndescribed the actual distributions of the human made, and the natural features.\nFig. 3\nReclassed features of Park A (King Abdul Aziz)\nFull size image\nTable 4 The feature distributions of Park A\nFull size table\nPark A (D. R. Seenivasagam), located in the heart of Ipoh is categorized as a local park in accordance with its size and service area to the surrounding. The park has many natural features based on its ecological and aesthetic value (Fig.\n4\n). It is known for its scenic beauty and recreational facilities. The reclassification process has successively produced a total of 23 classes of manmade and the natural features (Table\n5\n). In general, 23.8% of Park A is covered with trees and 12.4% filled with lakes. Other features are proportionally distributed.\nFig. 4\nReclassed features of Park B (D. R. Seenivasagam)\nFull size image\nTable 5 The feature distributions of Park B\nFull size table\n3.2\nQualitative Assessment\nThe qualitative assessment determines the urban resident’s responses towards their preferences and experiences on the green space features in the parks. The variables being measured were the social attributes (personal information and social preference) and the green space properties (green space and manmade features). This section provides the assessment results of the number of park users. the trip characteristics and park activities such as travel distance, length of stay, the frequency of visits, mode of transport, and perception of safety, aesthetics quality and facilities. Both parks have similar characteristics in terms of location, recreation activities, landscapes, and maintenance. Physical features of green space are related to functional attachment as it influenced and engaged park user to its surrounding. The functional attachment could be observed from the amount of familiarity, the period of engagement, dependency, satisfaction, and comfort [\n6\n]. To become functionally attached, the setting of surrounding must provide a feeling of being familiar with the physical environment, safe and enjoyable to its users. The overall results are presented based on the following functional attachments.\n3.2.1\nPark Visitation\nThe park visitors are mostly comprised of (>60%) male and (<40%) female (Fig.\n5\n). Man tends to visit parks more frequent than women as most of them are involved in active recreation such as exercise or improve their physical fitness. On the other hand, the purpose of women visiting the parks is significantly more often for contact with nature. People persist coming to the park merely for active leisure such as exercising, improve their physical fitness and provide nature attraction. The green space provides various opportunities for physical activity, enjoyment of nature, social interaction and escape [\n21\n]. In addition, the dominant visitors to both parks are the young people of age between 21 and 29 years since this age group prefers active activities. They represent most of the respondents and were identified as significant users of parks for recreational purposes as they enjoy doing physical activities such as playing on equipment, playing games and sport, going for a run, or talking/socializing. The younger generation obviously had more free time to spend in public spaces such as a recreational park [\n6\n]. Likewise, the older age group between 30 and 39 years old showed a high percentage of visitors to the park as they were associated with active recreation such as exercising, jogging, playing sports in the park. Then again, the senior citizens (60 years old and above) preferred passive activities such as relaxing and walking.\nFig. 5\nPark visitation\nFull size image\nThere is also an explicit relationship that correlates park visitation with proximity, traffic connectivity, aesthetics scenery and personal safety [\n35\n]. Neuvonen et al. [\n40\n] points out that the number of visits to green space is linked to park characteristics and park quality. Park with better qualities attracts more visitors from a wider area and parks containing a variety of features and amenities may support a wider range of activities. Likewise, the two parks being assessed have shown a high number of visitations and designed to attract all races, ages, and cultures to socialize.\n3.2.2\nTravelling Distance and Mode of Transport\nPeople go to the park for recreation and leisure activities that are associated with several factors such as demographic characteristics, type of physical activity to undertaken at the destinations and availability of local opportunities [\n34\n]. The distance traveled to a recreational park depends on the demographic characteristics, road network, and physical activity behavior and green space characteristics. It was observed that 35–40% of the park users travel within the range of 5–10 min to reach their respective parks (Fig.\n6\n). They are mostly the local communities of the nearby areas. Motorbike is the most popular mode of transportation by visitors in Park B. It also correlates with the park visitors’ age as indicated in Fig.\n5\n. Most of them are young people aged 21–29 years. Alternatively, 35–50% of them traveled by car in which they represent groups such as families, friends, relatives. Nevertheless, 4–8% of the park visitors still ride bicycles or walk to the park.\nFig. 6\nTravelling distance and mode of transport\nFull size image\nThe findings show that motorbikes and cars are the most popular mode of transportation to the parks. This indicates that the park visitors traveled some distance to the parks. Furthermore, motorbikes and cars have been the major their means of transportation. The usage of bicycles or walking is less than 10% for both parks. Although, the park visits and proximity are inversely related i.e. the closer the distance attracts more people to visit. But, if the visitors liked coming to the park, then the distance traveled is not an important issue.\n3.2.3\nFrequency of Visit\nThe green space characteristics and environment are always associated with park use and physical activities [\n28\n,\n34\n]. Martin et al. [\n33\n] claimed that the combined socio-demographic characteristics of the park visitors and the biophysical attributes of the greenspaces are important in influencing the frequency of visit. Besides, the accessibility and proximity are also related to the increased use of the green space. The results in Fig.\n7\nindicates than 40% visited the parks at least once a week, 17–28% on monthly basis, 8–25% visit on daily basis, and 9–12% coming to the park occasionally and rarely. The higher proportion of attendance during the weekend demonstrates that many of them visit the park to perform physical activity and other recreational opportunities or engaged in specific park features.\nFig. 7\nFrequency of visit\nFull size image\nThe frequency to daily, weekly or monthly use pattern correlates to the types and needs for recreational facilities. Furthermore, there are many other factors associated to higher levels of visitation such as the type of park, location of the park, good road networking, quality in terms of safety and good maintenance, the availability of a wide spectrum of recreational opportunities that include the facilities and amenities plus the natural beauty of the place. In general, both parks have easy access with good road networking with its surrounding and have all the characteristics that attract visitors to come frequently to the park. The users’ frequency of park visits affects their functional attachment to the park such as the feeling of security and comfort with the environments.\n3.2.4\nLength of Stay and Safety Features\nThe length of stay in green space and safety parameters are significant in establishing and maintaining the quality of parks. The feeling of safety and security is one of the most important human needs as every person needs to feel safe and secure in order to act and move around freely without being scared and terrified of the environment. This is a tangible reflection towards the community and a major factor in the perception of park users. The time frame of staying in the park influences the visitors’ perceptions of personal safety which indicates the feeling of comfort and secured within the surrounding. The Malaysia Park, Amenity and Recreation Management Society highlights that safety aspect must be emphasized in the design of parks to attend the needs of visitors and sense of place [\n51\n]. Safety features of the park include the presence of lighting, law enforcement, location of park near the road, residential and commercial area, the presence of security such as police, security park and safety signboard.\nThe length of stay and safety indicates that 52% of the respondents come to the park with their family or friends to spend their leisure time mostly for 30 min–1 h (Fig.\n8\n). About 38–40% of respondents spent 1–2 h at the site and 1–6% each spend their leisure time less than 30 min and between 2 and 3 h at the park. Only 25–47% of the park visitors claimed that they always felt safe to be in the park whereas 51–58% other responses said that they sometimes felt safe within the park. Only 2–16% of the respondents said they never felt safe and 1% had no opinion of safety aspects in the park. The length of stay is determined by many factors which relate to the physical and space qualities of the green space such as intangible characteristics, proximity, safety parameters and facilities provided in the park. The longer stay of park users indicates the wider range of activities and attractions within the green space. The safety parameters may involve the physical features in the park which gives perceived security to the users.\nFig. 8\nLength of stay and safety features\nFull size image\nApart from that, the length of stay is also influenced by the age group of visitors. From the findings also indicate that outdoor green spaces still seem to be important recreational venues among the local community. Park users coming with families or friends tend to spend more time in the park together to strengthen the family or friendship bonding among them rather than lone park user. Senior citizens are also likely to spend more time socializing among them after doing exercises.\n3.3\nPrioritizing the Green Space Features Using AHP Decision\nThe prioritized preference weight presents the ranking of green space features significantly in the selection “desirable” urban residential living areas. They were prioritized based on the needs of the public and the environment. The nine [\n9\n] features identified in the earlier section represents the decision criteria for a sustainable urban green space. Table\n6\nshows the final weighted criteria from the 20 decision makers determined by the geometric mean of the eigenvector method (EVM). Consequently, Table\n7\nsummarizes the AHP survey results in the form of an individual score, the geometric mean, consistency ratio and ranking of the nine (9) selected criteria.\nTable 6 The final weighted criteria from the 20 DMs\nFull size table\nTable 7 Summary of AHP survey results\nFull size table\nFigure\n9\nis the histogram plot of the geometric mean representing the ranked green space features based on the criterion weights. It shows that safety criteria (38.37%) has been identified as the most preferred and was unanimously ranked highest by the decision makers in relation to urban green space (recreational parks) planning in Ipoh city. Safety features refer to people’s perceptions and feelings in recreational park issues that correlate with park activities. The result correlates with the qualitative assessment, where the safety parameter agreed with half of the respondents (park users) that raised the safety issues in the parks.\nFig. 9\nRanking of green space features\nFull size image\nPerceptions of safety and security may affect the use of recreational areas where most of the visitors would stay 1–2 h in parks to perform their regular activities and enjoying the surrounding nature. The safety level can be upgraded through the placement of security guards, more lighting and having fencing around the parks. Hence, enhancing security and enforcement levels in the park has been the top priority issues considered by decision makers.\nMaintenance/park condition is given the second priority (19.51%). The maintenance variables contribute towards community well-being and enjoyment which meets park users need. This relates to cleanliness and condition of green space which includes the maintenance of the facilities and amenities within the park area. McCormack et al. [\n34\n] highlight that poor maintenance and condition can discourage park usage and will negatively affect aesthetics, perceptions of safety, functionality and the overall perception of the park quality. Maintenance of green space is an issue raised frequently from park users who would like to see green space environment clean, tidy and requires careful consideration in the design of green spaces. The third prioritized criteria i.e. accessibility and connectivity (15.31%) is regarded as another key determinant of features in green space. Accessibility has been cited in numerous studies that include the distance from home or the form of network routes that “influence how pleasant it can be to move from one area to another, how much daylight, landscape, and beauty we can enjoy” [\n48\n].\nThe property value criterion (7.47%) is preferred by the decision makers since attractive landscapes in urban green space influences the housing prices and it represents the environmental factors that attract buyers. The presence of green space brings many benefits in housing areas in which these elements improve the quality of life, enhancing the environmental quality and conservation tool for sustainable development [\n53\n]. Signage and lighting (5.09%) present additional important finding as it forms part of the amenities in green space. This feature is considered as physical characteristics or hard landscapes in the recreation park and considered as the people’s perception of safety by the decision makers. The presence of signage enhances perceived safety, friendly and caring others [\n27\n] while a lack of signs of human care may remind people of their own mortality and vulnerability to the forces of nature [\n31\n]. The visual pattern (4.75%) implies that it has similar important features contributing to the sustainable indicator of urban green space. The visual pattern indicates that people living and working in a busy urban area treasure urban spaces with plants, sunlight, and wind. It is correlated with the natural settings which establish the aesthetic quality of the environments such as plants combine with water elements that can significantly affect self-regulation and restorative healing experiences [\n2\n,\n41\n].\nRecreation and sports facilities are equally ranked as important (4.65%). The report by IFPRA (2013) has mentioned that facilities and amenities are important features related to park usage and activities. Recreation facilities such as basketball court, football field, jogging track, and children playground are the main attractions of attribute features in a park. Green space provided with recreation and sports facilities were found to be more efficient in stimulating or promoting physical activity [\n28\n]. The location of parks (3.06%) is directly related to accessibility and proximity that plays an important role in the local community of all ages and abilities. However, the residents associate the park’s location with accessibility, and the proximity is demonstrated through the frequency of their visits and their self-leisure exercises. Nevertheless, as urban parks are places where city residents could experience the beauty of nature, breathe fresh air and socializing with friends, hence the travel distance does not affect people going to parks. Lastly, the water bodies (1.81%) contributed to the production of sustainable urban green space and ecosystem. This feature is significant design elements that enrich the natural landscape and improve the spatial quality of human needs and the surrounding environment.\n3.4\nThe Correlation Between Preference and Prioritization\nThe correlation between the qualitative assessment (the urban resident’s responses according to their social preferences and experiences of the two parks in Ipoh city, and the relative preference of decision makers towards criteria affecting the design of green space feature attributes) is described in Table\n8\n.\nTable 8 Correlation between the qualitative assessment and the prioritization\nFull size table\nIt can be summarized that the safety attribute feature maintained as the most important feature both by the experts and user’s perception. It indicates that park activity correlates with the sense of safety. Maintenance and condition relate to park usage and perception of park quality. Green space features require consistent maintenance which includes the collection and removal of waste, the repair of damaged or worn items, the preservation, and conservation of human-made and vegetation features including replacing damaged plants, tree surgery, pruning and grass cutting, quality of pond water.\nAccessibility and connectivity are important with regards to the form of network routes that influence people to visit and movement in the park. Inclusively, the other features attributes have the important roles in sustaining urban green space as they are associated with the three main values in human life relationship within the urban green space features i.e. environmental values, social values, and economic values. Thus, the urban green space features must include the environmental characteristics of parks which cover the geographic areas and diversity that displayed the mixture of uses and users of the area. The geographic areas conversely comprise of the activity areas in the green space, the overall park and the surrounding neighborhood.\n4\nConclusions\nThis paper assessed the satisfactory level of the park visitors with regards to current green features in the study area. The satisfaction level has a correlation between the urban green space features with the visitor attraction and activities in their quest for healthiness and a place of comfort at all age groups. The significant feature attributes such as natural setting (visual quality), facilities, design, accessibility, location, water element, safety, and maintenance represent the important factors influencing the park’s usage and the park’s impact (number of visitors). The mix of natural and human-made elements has proved to encourage the attraction and visitation to urban green spaces. The availability of natural elements such as trees, flowers, and water features provide important insights towards the recreation and parks preferences that should be provided. Prioritizing the features of urban green space based on the expert decisions using AHP-decision making model is perceived as a novel approach towards the planning and development of urban green spaces. Eventually, the park safety features unanimously represent the most important indicator as it indicates that park activities correlate with the sense of safety. Inclusively, the order of priority for the sustainable park planning must include other features such as maintenance, accessibility, property value, signage and lighting, visual pattern, facilities, location, and water bodies. It is apparent that sustainable urban green space features are very significant to the urban environment, landscape, and community recreation. They contributed towards the three predominant values of human life which are environmental, social and economic benefits. Their close relationships with human life were in terms of characteristics, functionality and its outcome towards the appearance of recreational parks.\nIn conclusion, the findings of this paper provide significant resources for social and urban community development i.e. confidence level and increase the number of park users. It will help in the implementation of sustainable indicator policy on the future urban green space (parks and recreations) in giving the correct priority to the features.\nReferences\nAbdul M, Mariapan M, Mohd M, Aziz A (2011) Assessing the needs for quality neighbourhood parks.

        "abstract": "An infrequently studied question is how diverse combinations of built environment (BE) features relate to physical activity (PA) for older adults. We derived patterns of geographic information systems- (GIS) measured BE features and explored how they accounted for differences in objective and self-reported PA, sedentary time, and BMI in a sample of older adults. Senior Neighborhood Quality of Life Study participants (N = 714, aged 66–97 years, 52.1% women, 29.7% racial/ethnic minority) were sampled in 2005–2008 from the Seattle-King County, WA and Baltimore, MD-Washington, DC regions. Participants' home addresses were geocoded, and net residential density, land use mix, retail floor area ratio, intersection density, public transit density, and public park and private recreation facility density measures for 1-km network buffers were derived. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) were estimated from these GIS-based measures. In multilevel regression models, profiles were compared on accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time and self-reported PA, adjusting for covariates and clustering. Analyses were conducted in 2014–2015. LPAs yielded three profiles: low walkability/transit/recreation (L − L − L); mean walkability/transit/recreation (M-M-M); and high walkability/transit/recreation (H − H − H). Three PA outcomes were more favorable in the HHH than the LLL profile group (difference of 7.2 min/day for MVPA, 97.8 min/week for walking for errands, and 79.2 min/week for walking for exercise; all ps < 0.02). The most and least activity-supportive BE profiles showed greater differences in older adults' PA than did groupings based solely on a 4-component walkability index, suggesting that diverse BE features are important for healthy aging.",

Abstract Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords 1. Introduction 2. Methods 2.1. Neighborhood environment measures 2.1.1. Walkability Components (1)\nnet residential density—the ratio of residential dwelling units to land area devoted to residential land use within a buffer; (2)\nintersection density —the number of intersections with three or more legs divided by the total land area of the buffer—higher intersection density corresponds to shorter, more direct paths between destinations; (3)\nland use mix or the diversity and evenness of nearby and accessible destinations present in a buffer across five land use types (residential, retail/commercial, entertainment, food-related, and civic/institutional)—with normalized values ranging from 0 (indicating a single land use, most likely residential) to 1 (indicating an even distribution, i.e., 20% of parcel areas dedicated to each of 5 use types); and (4)\nretail floor area ratio (RFAR)—the ratio of retail building floor areas divided by retail parcel land areas—low RFAR indicates retail development likely to have substantial space devoted to parking, while high RFAR indicates smaller building setbacks typical of pedestrian-oriented designs. Individual walkability components were included in the latent profile analyses rather than a single walkability index score computed from the four components. 2.1.2. Public transportation 2.1.3.

        "abstract": "Introduction Diverse combinations of built environment (BE) features for physical activity (PA) are understudied. This study explored whether patterns of GIS-derived BE features explained objective and self-reported PA, sedentary behavior, and BMI. Methods Neighborhood Quality of Life Study participants (N=2,199, aged 20-65 years, 48.2% female, 26% ethnic minority) were sampled in 2001-2005 from Seattle / King County WA and Baltimore MD / Washington DC regions. Their addresses were geocoded to compute net residential density, land use mix, retail floor area ratio, intersection density, public transit, and public park and private recreation facility densities using a 1-km network buffer. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) were estimated from these variables. Multilevel regression models compared profiles on accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and self-reported PA, adjusting for covariates and clustering. Analyses were conducted in 2013-2014. Results Seattle region LPAs yielded four profiles, including low walkability/transit/recreation (L-L-L); mean walkability/transit/recreation (M-M-M); moderately high walkability/transit/recreation (MH-MH-MH); and high walkability/transit/recreation (H-HH). All measures were higher in the HHH than the LLL profile (difference of 17.1 minutes/day for MVPA, 146.5 minutes/week for walking for transportation, 58.2 minutes/week for leisure-time PA, and 2.2 BMI points; all p<0.05). Baltimore region LPAs yielded four profiles, including L-L-L; M-M-M; high land use mix, transit, and recreation (HLU-HT-HRA); and high intersection density, high retail floor area ratio (HID-HRFAR). HLU-HT-HRA and L-L-L differed by 12.3 MVPA minutes/day; HID-HRFAR and L-L-L differed by 157.4 minutes/week for walking for transportation (all p<0.05). Conclusions Patterns of environmental features explain greater differences in adults' PA than the four-component walkability index.",

Measures Statistical Analysis 1.\nmeeting MVPA recommendations (PROC GLIMMIX); 2.\nlog-transformed accelerometer-measured MVPA and sedentary minutes/day (2-4 PROC MIXED); 3.\nlog-transformed self-reported PA minutes/week (i.e., walking for transportation, leisure-time) and sitting time minutes per week; and 4.\nBMI.

Discussion 1\noperationalizing neighborhood as a 1-km network buffer (versus block group), as block groups can include features made inaccessible by barriers like freeways or rivers and can exclude accessible features just across block group boundaries; 2\ninclusion of transit, parks, and recreation facilities, allowing for more-complex BE patterns to emerge and contributing to a more-comprehensive picture of neighborhoods; 3\nspecific feature patterns resulting from the LPA methodology; or 4\nsome combination of these methodologic components.

Participation was given for all children in the intervention group since in this group the intervention was part of the normal school curriculum.

Based on our data, we aim to provide important information regarding the influence of such an intervention on these outcome measures in school-aged children and to provide nationwide guidelines to improve PA in children.\nBackground\nInitiation and realization of the research project\nThe debate regarding the ideal amount of physical education lessons that the state is ready to support is a major controversial issue in many countries, including Switzerland [\n1\n]. The importance of the growing problem of an inactive lifestyle in children, with the burden major health implications like obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, low fitness and osteoporosis, is highly undervalued. The Swiss Federal Office of Sports (FOSPO) therefore decided to support an evaluation of the current level of physical activity (PA), fitness and health of elementary school children in Switzerland in addition to a school-based PA intervention program over the period of one academic year with a follow up three years later.\nArguments for publishing a design paper\nIn this article we describe the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing a school-based PA enhancing program which took place over the period of one school year. Publishing the design and rational of a RCT before the results are available has important benefits. The study can be critically evaluated for its methodological quality, irrespective of the results. If a design paper has been written, the results will most probably be published, even if the results are negative. A design paper includes a more detailed description of the study population, the intervention and all outcome measures than what can be reported in the method section of a regular publication focusing only on part of the study results. This paper will help researchers in the same field to compare the methods and the methodological qualities of future RCT and it provides detailed information for health professionals or educators to apply the intervention if the results show improvements in the outcome measures.\nIntroduction\nThe increase in sedentary behavior, i.e. physical inactivity, over the last decades is thought to be one of the main risk factors for the development of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and psychosocial constraints [\n2\n]. Despite widespread attempts to increase PA in the general population, only a minority of adults and children in developed countries engage in PA to a degree sufficient to maintain or increase health and physical as well as psychosocial well-being [\n3\n]. There is evidence that an insufficient amount of PA starts in childhood and tracks into adult life [\n4\n]. Risk factors which enhance sedentary behavior are large amounts of time spent in front of the television and/or computer, the inability to play outside or to actively commute to school, inactive parents or parents who do not support children to be active, and the lack of sufficient physical education at school. Although in children aerobic fitness is only moderately associated with PA, low PA and fitness are both associated with increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors [\n5\n], even after adjusting for weight and/or obesity [\n5\n].\nCurrently, about 40–50% of the European adult population is overweight. Being overweight is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, musculo-sceletal disorders, and impaired quality of life [\n6\n]. The current epidemic of overweight and obesity is largely caused by an environment that promotes excessive food intake and discourages physical activity [\n7\n]. Even among children and adolescents, an alarming increase in overweight has been noticed. In 2002, the prevalence of overweight in 6- to 12-year-old Swiss children was 16.6 and 19.9% in boys and girls, respectively [\n8\n]. Even if obese adolescents become normal weight adults, they keep their burden of an increased cardiovascular risk [\n9\n]. Furthermore, there is a close link between (central) obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors like insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and low-grade chronic inflammation in children and adolescents [\n5\n,\n10\n]. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome has dramatically increased, and 46% of US adolescents have at least one risk factor of the metabolic syndrome [\n11\n]. Overweight children are also at increased risk to develop orthopedic complications and to suffer from stigmatization and discrimination [\n12\n].\nPA does not only positively influence physiological factors, but has also a positive effect on psychological aspects. Fifty percent or even more of elementary school children report to be stressed or exhausted, and not able to sleep well [\n13\n]. Regular PA can increase the ability to cope with stress and leads to an improved health perception and quality of life [\n14\n]. In addition, a positive influence of PA on measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms [\n15\n] has been shown. PA does not only act on an individual level, but influences the school climate positively by increasing social competence within classes. This leads to an improved social behavior and more satisfaction with school, rated both by pupils and teachers [\n16\n]. Furthermore, regular PA can reduce substance abuse such as smoking [\n17\n]. Overweight children are particularly at increased risk to have a low self-esteem and to suffer from stigmatization and discrimination [\n12\n]. One report showed that the addition of regular PA lead to a higher self-esteem one year later in those children [\n18\n].\nMaximizing bone mass during growth may constitute one of the most effective prevention strategies for osteoporosis, a disease which affects millions of people throughout the world. There is evidence that the degree of weight bearing activity and calcium intake is related to bone mass in childhood and adolescence [\n19\n,\n20\n]. Therefore, the benefits from PA in childhood may continue even into late adulthood [\n21\n].\nMany school-based intervention studies promoting PA and a healthy lifestyle have been performed over the last two decades [\n22\n]. However, only a few studies documented increased PA during school-time [\n23\n,\n24\n]. In one study, even a reduction in out-of school PA as result of a PA program at school was observed [\n25\n]. In general, the results are disappointing, possibly due to methodological limitations, such as non-randomized trials, lack of objective measurements of PA and fitness, promotion of PA by non-experts and incomplete evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors [\n22\n,\n26\n]. In addition, a lack of overall increase in PA observed in many school-based intervention studies could be either due to compensation by increasing sedentary activity during out-of school time, or possibly due to the promotion of interventions that may not have been vigorous or sustained enough. A major advantage of interventions focusing on elementary school children is the relatively easy access through the schools, where changes in the school environment that promote healthy behaviors can be easier implemented and monitored, and can reach many schoolchildren of all social classes. Furthermore, the school environment gives the opportunity to work on various areas before, during and after school to increase overall and/or total PA.\nMethods/Design\nStudy objectives\nThe aim of the proposed project was to evaluate in a RCT a school-based program if implementation of an extended PA program throughout the day during one school-year improved overall PA, physical fitness, physical health, and psychosocial well-being in 6- to 13-year-old children.\nMain outcomes\nPrimary outcomes of the intervention study were defined as\n1. an increase in total PA measured by accelerometers,\n2. an increase in aerobic fitness measured by the 20 m shuttle run test,\n3. a reduction of percent body fat measured by skinfolds\n4. an increase in quality of life measured by the child health questionnaire\nin the intervention group compared to the control group.\nSecondary outcomes of the intervention study were overall fitness (i.e. strength, speed, endurance, flexibility and coordination), body composition (including body fat distribution), cardiovascular risk factors (including blood pressure, blood lipids, glucose metabolism, C-reactive protein, adiponectin), bone health (including bone mineral content and density of femur, lumbar spine and total body as well as bone metabolism), psychosocial health (including social and stress coping, social anxiety, self esteem, drug abuse), and food intake. These outcomes were tested in different subgroups, i.e. 1\nst\nvs. 5\nth\ngrade, girls vs. boys, children of different weight status, pubertal stages and socio-economic background.\nStudy groups/Recruitment\nFigure\n1\nshows the flow diagram of the recruited population. The study was performed in two provinces of Switzerland. Within these provinces, there were 919 elementary schools. Of these 95 fulfilled our stratification criteria, i.e. rural versus urban localization, and a prevalence of 10–30% children from other ethnicities. These strata were chosen in order to be representative for the Swiss population. Recruitment of participating schools (i.e. cluster randomization) was based on the willingness of these 95 elementary schools to be randomized either to an intervention group with a PA curriculum or a control group. Fifty percent of all children were in 1\nst\ngrade (6–8 years), and the other children were in 5\nth\ngrade (10–12 years) with evenly distributed gender. Fifteen schools with a total of 27 classes were randomized by a random-number table. Sixteen classes in 9 schools located in 6 communities were randomized to the intervention group (INT), and eleven classes in 6 schools in other communities of the same provinces were randomized to the control group (CON). A higher number of schools in the INT than in the CON group, i.e. a randomization ratio of 3:2 was chosen to gain more experience with the intervention and to reduce costs of the trial. Data of the INT and CON group were collected solely in the schools, in order to minimize the absence time from the usual school curriculum due to travelling.\nFigure 1\nParticipant flow chart.\nFull size image\nAlthough the intervention program itself was established as part of the school curriculum for all children in the INT group, informed consent for the questionnaires and all measurements was necessary for all participants and was given by the children and a parent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the University of Basel, the University of Zürich, as well as by the cantonal ethical committee of Aargau, Switzerland.\nData analysis\nTo compare the success of randomization, descriptive statistics were used to compare the baseline measurements of the two groups. The primary analysis was a comparison of the change of the primary and secondary outcome factors between the intervention and the control group following the \"intention to treat\" principle. Initial power analysis was based on a two-sided t-test on the pre-post changes in the primary outcome measures (total PA, aerobic fitness, percent body fat, quality of life), with adjustments to account for the intraclass correlation (ICC) due to cluster randomization by school. The study was powered to detect a medium effect size on all primary study outcome measures of 0.5 units of standard deviation with 79% power if the ICC was 0.10 and with 90% power if the ICC was 0.06. Sample size required to reach the estimated power was a total of 360 children at the third measurement, four years after baseline assessment. Assuming an attrition rate of 10–15% and accounting for the multiple secondary outcomes, we recruited 530 children in the intervention and control group to provide adequate power to test/challenge the following null-hypothesis of the study: At the end of the intervention there will be no difference in the primary outcomes between the intervention and the control groups. Pre-planned subgroup analyses will be performed for age groups (1\nst\nvs. 5\nth\ngrade), gender, weight status, pubertal stage, and socio-economic background. Where appropriate, adjustments were made for differences in baseline values. The same differences in the outcomes will be also tested 3 years later.\nStudy organization\nAll INT groups proceeded according to the same curriculum, prepared by the expert physical education teachers. The content of each physical education lesson was based on important fitness or activity components, including motor skills, aerobic fitness, strength and impact loading which are known to improve overall or specific health in children. Lessons generally included 5 minutes of warming up and cooling down each, 20 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and 15 minutes of strength training and impact loading. The physical education lessons were individualized as much as possible, so that each child was given a task possible to fulfill, based on his/her personal level. Utmost importance was given to a positive and motivating ambience during the lessons, to create any type of positive feeling and attitude towards PA.\nEvery INT class had one expert physical education teacher assigned. These teachers met with the \"program director\" (LZ) and the other main study organizers every two to four weeks to discuss the curriculum and problems that arose. Manuals were handed over to the classroom teachers regarding intervention points 1, 2 and 4 (see below) and they remained in close contact with their assigned expert physical education teachers.\nChildren suffering from chronic disease that prohibited the PA program, i.e. cyanotic heart disease or severe motor handicaps, were excluded. The intervention consisted of increasing PA during school, school breaks and at home. The following was applied to all 1\nst\nand 5\nth\ngrade classes throughout one school year:\n1.\nDaily physical education classes\n. The three already existing regular weekly physical education lessons (45 minutes each) were given by the usual classroom teachers according to a specified curriculum, with the content of the lessons determined by the expert physical education teachers. The classroom teachers had a continuous education by these experts regarding their own physical education lessons. The two additional weekly lessons (45 minutes each) were given by the expert physical education teachers. The usual classroom teachers took part in these lessons for teaching purposes.\n2. Several\nshort activity breaks\n(2–5 min each) during academic lessons were introduced every day according to a specified curriculum.\n3.\nPA homework\nprepared by the expert physical education teachers, for improvement of motor skills, aerobic fitness, strength and jumping activities were given.\n4.\nPlayground areas\nof the schools were adapted and improved to encourage activities during school breaks, before and after school.\n5.\nActive commuting\nto school was encouraged on the family and teachers level by flyers and posters in the schools.\n6.\nFamilies\nwere encouraged to be physically active through flyers which were distributed over the year.\n7. The expert physical education teacher encouraged the children on two occasions to\ndecrease media use time\nin general. One flyer was handed to the children promoting less television time and more PA.\nFurthermore, minimal basic nutritional information and advice was handed out to all children and their parents (INT and CON group) in the form of three flyers. These flyers comprised information about: 1. general healthy nutrition and the nutritional pyramid, 2. appropriate calcium and Vitamin D intake for healthy bones and, 3. healthy snacks for the school breaks.\nThe CON group continued to follow their usual school curriculum which included three physical education lessons (45 min each) per week, given by their classroom teachers. Children and parents were blinded regarding the existence of intervention schools. The teachers, however, knew about the intervention arm. Children and parents were told that the aim of the study was the assessment of PA, fitness and health of Swiss children.\nMeasurements\nAll measurements, i.e. at baseline, at the end of the intervention and again three years later were done within the same three weeks period for INT and CON children. Table\n1\ngives an overview about all measurements taken. We defined three groups for the different assessments (medical team, questionnaire team, fitness team) who worked in parallel in different schools. In each team, the same one to two main research assistants were present at every assessment, to minimize inter-observer variability. The medical team was responsible for anthropometry, cardiovascular risk assessment, blood and urine sampling and accelerometry. The questionnaire team was responsible for the distribution, help in completion and collection of all questionnaires. The fitness team performed the fitness testing. Due to the immense personnel used to perform all assessments, only a part of the researchers were blinded to group allocation. Blinded measurements included height and weight assessment, bioelectrical impedance, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and some of the fitness tests. Formal, standardized training of all people involved in the measurements was done in a pilot study, including two school classes with 7- to 11-year-old children three months prior to baseline assessment.\nTable 1 Overview of measurements\nFull size table\nMeasures\nPhysical activity\nPhysical activity was assessed by an accelerometer (MTI/CSA 7164, Actigraph, Shalimar, FL, USA) which was constantly worn around the hip over 7 days at baseline (summertime), 5–6 months into the intervention (wintertime) and at the end of the intervention both in the INT and the CON group. The 6 months measurements were done in order to be able to find variations of PA levels among seasons. The sampling epoch was set at one minute, and data were included if at least 4 full days (at least 3 weekdays and one weekend day) of measurements with a minimum of 12 hours for the weekdays and 10 hours for the weekends were measured [\n27\n]. The minimal measure time for the weekends was less, as most of the children slept 1–2 hours longer on these days. Time with over 30 min of continuous zero values was erased. Correlation coefficients between the CSA and indirect calorimetry are 0.62–0.93 and against direct observation 0.80–0.97 [\n28\n]. Overall PA was expressed as total counts per day and average counts/min. Moderate to vigorous physical activity as well as vigorous physical activity was determined based on time above different proposed, previously published cut-off levels for children [\n27\n].\nOverall physical fitness\nOverall fitness, as listed below, was assessed by a combination of the Eurofit test\n1\n[\n29\n], the Körper-Koordinationstest\n2\n[\n30\n] and the \"Allgemeiner Sportmotorischer Test für Kinder\"\n3\n[\n31\n]. All tests were performed in the gyms of the corresponding local schools with the same equipment. For 8 tests out of these 11 tests, the better result of two trials was used, unless mentioned otherwise. The tests number 5, 9 and 11 were maximal tests and thus only performed once. Test results were compared to published norm values for European children [\n32\n,\n33\n]. The following tests were included:\n1.\nBalancing backwards\n2\n: this test of coordination included balancing backwards on 3 m long bars with a width of 3, 4.5 and 6 cm, respectively. The number of steps until the child's foot touched the floor was counted; 3 trials were performed for each bar width, and the sum of these 9 tests was used.\n2.\nPushing the medicine ball\n3\n: holding a 1 kg (and for children aged 11 years or older also a 3 kg) medicine ball against the chest and pushing it away as far as possible. The pushing distance was measured in cm.\n3.\nThrowing the tennis ball\n3\n: throwing a tennis ball towards a 60 cm wide square target from a distance of 3 m. Hitting the inner centre of 10 cm yielded 3, the intermediate square 2 and the outer square 1 point, respectively. The total score of 10 tests was used.\n4.\nJumping sidewards\n2\n: jumping with both legs together on alternating sides of a strip of wood, as many times as possible, within 15 seconds. The number of jumps was counted.\n5.\nSit-ups\n1\n: maximum number of sit-ups achieved in 30 seconds.\n6.\n20 m sprint\n3\n: electronic measurement of a timed (seconds) 20 m sprint, starting from a resting position, with a precision of 1/100 second.\n7.\nPlate tapping\n1\n: the time needed for tapping 2 plates (edges were 60 cm apart) alternately, with the preferred hand, until each plate was touched 25 times. Time in seconds was measured to the nearest of 1/10 of a second.\n8.\nJump and reach\n3\n: the difference in height between standing (baseline) and after a maximal jump (endpoint) with arms rose on both occasions. The difference between baseline and endpoint in cm was measured.\n9.\nBent-arm hang\n1\n: maintaining a bent arm position with an over-grip as long as possible while hanging from a bar. The duration in sec with a precision of 1/10 of a second was measured.\n10.\nSit and reach\n1\n: bending the trunk and reaching forward as far as possible while sitting on the floor with stretched legs and with the feet placed against a test box. A ruler was placed on the top of the box. The difference between the feet soles and the tip of the largest finger was measured in cm.\n11.\nShuttle-run-test\n1\n: A 20 m shuttle run was applied to all children [\n34\n]. It is a validated test [\n35\n] which measures aerobic capacity by running forth and back for 20 m, with an initial running pace of 8.0 km/h and a progressive 0.5 km/min raise of the running speed given by a sound. The maximal performance was reached when the child did not cross the 20 m line at the moment of the beep for two consecutive 20 m distances. Numbers of \"paliers\" (1 palier\n≅\n1 minute) performed were counted with a precision of 0.5 paliers.\nAnthropometry and body composition\nStanding and sitting height were measured by a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca, Basel, Switzerland, accuracy 0.2 cm) and body weight was determined using an electronic scale (Seca, Basel, Switzerland; accuracy 0.05 g). Maximal armspan was measured by extending the arms looking against a wall where a movable tape was fixed. Waist circumference was measured by a flexible tape at the natural waist (smallest circumference between the ribcage and the iliac crest) and half-way between the lower cost rim and the Spina iliaca anterior superior. Inter-observer coefficient of variation was 0.7–1.6% in the pilot study. Skinfold thickness was measured in triplicate to the nearest 0.5 mm with Harpenden calipers (HSK-BI, British Indicators, UK) calibrated to exert a pressure of 10 g/cm\n2\nto the skin. Four sites over triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiacal were measured based on standard procedures. The same two investigators took all measurements. Inter-observer coefficient of variation tested in a pilot study was 5.6% for biceps, 4.7% for triceps, 7.5% for subscapular and 14.6% for suprailiacal sites, respectively. The sum of the four SF was taken to calculate percent body fat (%BF) according to several validated formulas [\n37\n,\n38\n]. The calculation of %BF with this method has a prediction error of 3–5% [\n37\n,\n38\n]. Bioelectrical impedance was measured by a tetrapolar single frequency device (RJL Systems, Model 101A; Detroit, MI, USA). The unit was calibrated prior to each testing day using a 500-ohm resistor provided by the company. Measurements were taken based on standard procedures (Bioelectrical Impedance analysis in body composition measurements [\n39\n]. If the distance from the proximal to the distal electrode was less than 5 cm in small children, the proximal electrode was located more proximal until the distance of 5 cm was attained. %BF was calculated based on validated formulas [\n40\n]. The calculation of % BF with this method has a precision error of 4–5% [\n40\n]. Additionally, body composition was determined by means of bioimpedentiometric analysis at frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 kHz using a tetrapolar impedance plethysmograph (In Body 3.0; Biospace, Seoul, Korea) and standardized procedures. Total and regional body fat was also measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were scanned by the use of a whole body DXA system (model QDR-4500, Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA). They laid supine on the DXA table with arms adequately separated from the trunk and were instructed to remain still throughout the scanning procedure. Body composition was assessed by the 3-compartement model, including fat mass, bone mineral content and fat-free soft tissue. DXA was found to be reliable in children [\n41\n] and sensitive for changes of fat and lean body mass [\n42\n]. For determination of abdominal fat mass a quadrilateral box was manually drawn around the L1–L4 region of interest bounded inferiorly by the horizontal line identifying L4/L5 vertebral space and superiorly by the horizontal line identifying the T12/L1 vertebral space [\n43\n].\nBlood pressure\nBlood pressure was assessed after a rest period of five minutes at the right arm based on recommendations of the American Heart Association. An automated oszillograph (Oscillomate, CAS Medical Systems, Branford, CT, USA) was used in order to reduce inter-observer variability. Blood pressure was measured five times and the mean of the three measurements with the smallest variation was taken. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were expressed in percentiles [\n44\n]\nAssays\nBlood sampling was done early in the morning between 7.30 and 9.30 am after an overnight fast and at least 30 minutes after application of an anaesthetic cream with lidocaine and prilocaine (Emla, Astra, Switzerland). After the procedure, a breakfast was served to all children.\nBloods were drawn for measurements of glucose, insulin, lipid, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The blood was collected in vacutainers which were immediately put on ice. After the sampling, the blood was transported to the hospital where it was analyzed within a few hours after sampling. The rest of the blood was centrifuged, divided into 1.0 ml aliquots and stored at -70°C until batch-analyses. Insulin was measured by electro-chemiluminescence (Roche-Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The reference range for insulin is 17.8–173 pmol/L (2.6–24.9 μU/ml), the intra-assay coefficient variation (CV) is 1.90% and the inter-assay CV is 2.60%. This insulin test is highly specific and has no known cross-reactions to proinsulin. Serum glucose was measured by the hexokinase method. Insulin resistance (IR) was estimated by calculating homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index (fasting serum insulin (μU/ml) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/liter)/22.5). SHBG concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (Roche-Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The intra-assay CV of SHBG concentrations are 2.7% and the inter-assay CV is 5.6%. Hs-CRP was measured automatically by a nephelometric latex immunoassay (Roche-Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The functional sensitivity of hs-CRP is 0.11 mg/L, and the reference range was less than 5 mg/L. The intra-assay CV of hs-CRP is 1.34% and, the inter-assay CV 5.70% at the cut-off of the reference range. Adiponectin was measured with an ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). At the lower reference range the intra-assay CV is 2.5% and the inter-assay CV 6.8%. Samples for each subject were run in the same assay. Total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were measured with a homogenous enzymatic colorimetric test, while low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol will be calculated by the Friedewald's formula. Within assay and between assay CV is 0.8 and 1.7% for total cholesterol, 0.7% and 1.6% for HDL, 1.5% and 1.8% for triglycerides, respectively. Children were asked if they had accidentally eaten or if they suffered from any acute infectious illness. The respective samples of these children were removed from further analyses.\nBone health\nBone mineral content (BMC, g), bone area (BA, cm\n2\n) and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm\n2\n) were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a Hologic QDR-4500 instrument (Waltham, MA, USA). The following skeletal sites were assessed: total body, femoral neck and trochanter, and L1–L4 vertebrae in antero-posterior view as reported previously [\n45\n]. The coefficient of variation of repeated measurements at these sites as determined in young healthy adults varies between 1–1.6% for BMD, and 0.3–3% for BMC and BA [\n46\n].\nFor the bone markers, a morning spot urine was collected in addition to the blood samples. From the sera, we measured procollagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP) by antibody radioimmune assay (Orion Diagnostics, Espo, Finland) collagen type I telopeptide (CTX), N-MID-osteocalcin (OC), intact parathormon (PTH) by electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) in an automated analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and vitamin D (25-OH-Vit D) by RIA (25-Hydroxyvitamin D RIA Kit, Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA). Extraction of 25-OH-D and further hydroxylated serum metabolites were performed through acetonitril. We furthermore measured alkaline creatinine phosphatase in urine and serum by auto-analyzer (Hitachi 911, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), urine N-telopeptid (NTX) of type I collagen/creatinine by ELISA (Osteomark NTx, Ostex International, Seattle, WA, USA), pyridinium collagen crosslinks (pyridoline, PYD; desoxypyridoline, DPD)/creatinine in the urine by „high performance liquid chromatography\" (HPLC) with a kit of BioRad Laboratories (München, Germany).\nQuestionnaires\nAll questionnaires were distributed by school classes in coded envelopes. The PA and psychosocial health questionnaires of the 5\nth\ngraders were filled out by the children themselves. To prevent bias from the parents, the psychosocial questionnaire for the 1\nst\ngraders was filled out at school. The rest of the questionnaires (personal and family history, quality of life, food frequency and calcium questionnaire, PA of 1\nst\ngraders and parents, questionnaire about school) were taken home and filled out by the parents. Questions and answers for this questionnaire were read in front of the child and the answers were filled out by the researcher. Questionnaires were sent in two batches of different sets to the parents, within one week interval to spread the load of questions. The teachers collected the questionnaires some days later. Translation of the questionnaires was not done, because only a small number of parents had insufficient knowledge of the German language, and if so, they got help from the school social workers, from the teachers or from friends.\nPhysical activity\nThe PA questionnaire was composed of several validated questionnaires [\n47\n,\n48\n]. In addition, we added questions about physical activities performed outdoors, the way of commuting to school, as well as questions about inactivity behavior with duration (minutes) and frequency (i.e. times per week) in front of TV or computers. The parents also got a questionnaire to evaluate the nature and extent of their own PA and their attitude towards PA of their children.\nPersonal and family history\nThis questionnaire included information about birth weight and pregnancy week recalled by the parents, personal history for injuries and disease (i.e. back pain, cardiovascular or bone disease in the family), weight and height of family members, as well as education and profession of the parents. Included in this questionnaire was also a sheet with the Tanner stages on which children and parents had to rate the pubertal stage of the child (only for the 11-year-old children).\nPsychosocial health and quality of life\nThis questionnaire included scales of published and validated questionnaires to assess social indicators of psychosocial health which might interact with daily PA, fitness and health of school-children, such as health-related indicators of quality of life [\n49\n,\n50\n], social climate in school [\n51\n], coping strategies with stress [\n52\n], social anxiety [\n53\n], depressed mood, self-esteem [\n54\n] and substance abuse [\n55\n].\nFood and calcium intake\nDaily food intake was assessed by an abbreviated form of the CARDIA food frequency questionnaire [\n56\n], adapted to Swiss nutrition patterns (this was done based on our own experience, the experience of other pediatricians and on the experience of a preschool-based intervention program. Briefly, parents were asked to report where breakfast, dinner and evening meals were eaten, whether meals were cooked, and how frequently meals were eaten in fast food or normal restaurants. According to the CARDIA food frequency questionnaire, we also assessed the frequency of weekly servings of fruits, raw and cooked vegetables, whole grain bread, refined grains (white bread, corn flakes), of foods typical of fast foods (pizza, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, french fries, other fried food), of foods with a content high in saturated or total fat or sweets (nuts, sausages, potato chips, chocolate, ice cream, cookies, cakes, lollipops, other sweets), and of beverages (sugared carbonated drinks, fruit juices, chocolate drinks). Calcium intake was assessed by a validated questionnaire [\n57\n] adapted to the Swiss nutrition pattern.\nDiary for school absence\nAll reasons for any absence from school and physical education classes was noted continuously by the classroom teachers. When the child regained school, a questionnaire about reasons for the absence from school or physical education was handed to the child and filled out by the parents. In case of a visit to a physician, these physicians were asked to fill out a form with the main complaints and the diagnosis. The sheet was returned to the study physician in a closed envelope. Teachers noted information regarding all causes of reduction in physical education of more than a day.\nDiscussion\nAs suggested by world experts who met to define the minimum time spent in PA to secure health and to prevent unhealthy weight gain [\n3\n], the school is an ideal setting in which environmental changes to increase PA and decrease sedentary behaviour in children can be implemented. A public school-based PA intervention offers a good opportunity to work with a large group of average children irrespective of their parents' behaviour and attitudes towards PA and health, and irrespective of their socioeconomic background. This is important for many reasons. Although cross-sectional studies have emphasized the role of the family regarding PA [\n58\n] and some of the consequences of insufficient PA such as childhood obesity, approaches focusing on changing individual or family behaviours have been shown to be time-consuming and costly, and have only yielded few successes [\n26\n]. Interventions to change lifestyle habits through a change in environment, such as the school environment, are found to be more successful, especially if they take place early in life [\n59\n]. Secondly, it seems that the socioeconomically deprived children are those who experience the greatest reduction of PA and some of its consequences and are also most difficult to reach by any preventive measure that is not included in the regular school curriculum.\nThe increase in PA during school hours for all children and our attempt to encompass out-of school behaviour allows us to test, whether a compensatory decrease in PA outside school can be avoided, and whether outcome is different in children with different weight status, different degrees of PA and different socio-economic background. The focus on PA alone with a negligible advice regarding television viewing and nutrition, which was also given to the control group, helps us to assess the impact of changes in PA by itself in these age groups on outcome measures like childhood obesity. In contrast to interventions focusing on nutrition or media use, changing PA is less directly linked to prohibition of activities and may thus be perceived as positive rather than negative.\nOur trial has some limitations. First, despite the randomization of intervention and control schools, the children, parents and classroom teachers knew the group allocation prior to baseline testing which could bias test results. This was unavoidable, as the time schedule and organization of the school year in the intervention groups had to be adapted several months before the school year started. Second, some of the investigators were not blinded to group assignment of the children because of the extensive need of manpower for testing and the financial restraints to recruit additional, blinded personnel. To assess some of the variables, we did not exclusively use validated measures. For example, we modified some of the questionnaires regarding PA or food intake to better adapt to our local situation and to broaden some of the information. Regarding PA, we will validate the questionnaires against the accelerometer measurements both before and after the intervention. Regarding the food questionnaire, we think that it is more informative to adapt them to the local use, especially as the gold standard, i.e. a 3–7 dietary recall protocol by itself has many shortcomings. PA has various effects on multiple determinants of health. We therefore defined several primary outcomes to be able to measure all important aspects related to an increased PA which we intended to induce by our intervention.\nWe hypothesize that our intervention will lead to an increase in PA, fitness and overall health. Should we be able to confirm these hypotheses, implementation of the PA promotion program throughout Switzerland and in other countries will help to improve health and fitness of our school children with the obvious potential of reduced direct (health care) and indirect (work absenteeism and productivity) costs later in life.\nReferences\nPuehse U, Gerber M: International Comparison of Physical Education.

        "abstract": "Promoting Urban Green Space (UGS) is one of the major requests of green cities for urban planners and local officials, and it is linked to myriad environmental and social benefits. However, scant literature has positioned the UGS into the background of fast regionalisation to unravel their relationships and mechanisms. This study delves into the impact and mechanisms of regional cooperation upon the provision of UGS in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), a dynamic city-region in southern China. Through social network analysis, panel data analysis, documentary review (analysis), and in-depth interviews, this study found that overall, regional cooperation has positive impacts on UGS provision in the GBA in the spheres of economic, social, institutional, and environmental affairs. We argued that economic cooperation encroaches on UGS by fostering infrastructure and economic zones; it also upgrades the industrial sectors and intensifies land use to positively affect UGS provision. Social cooperation reinforces population influx yet fosters social cohesion, sustainable lifestyles, and green economics to support the delivery of UGS policies. Environmental cooperation among local officials facilitates the implementation of urban greening projects, and institutional cooperation is conducive to urban governance in spatial greening planning. For the local government, the focal point for pursuing the green city vision is collaborative actions across the economic, social, environmental, and institutional spheres.",

        "abstract": "The urban green infrastructure has been increasingly used for sustainable design and resilient cities. Despite its many benefits, such as aesthetic enhancement, improvement of the physical and mental health of residents, especially for vulnerable youth and elderly people, or creating opportunities for social cohesion and climate regulation, green infrastructure has not been used in low-income housing in subtropical Brazil, where the temperature can reach over 40 °C along the summer. This study evaluated a full-scale, low-cost green façade over a year to assess its effect on the thermal performance of an eco-friendly affordable housing located in humid subtropical climate. Aiming to be eco-friendly and keep its cost low, the house was built with materials such as unplastered hollow soil-cement bricks, not having very good thermal performance. The Wisteria floribunda, a deciduous vine, was used in the green façade installed on a west-facing wall, adjacent to a bare wall, which was also evaluated enabling to establish the thermal difference between the shaded wall and the bare wall. In the winter, the shaded and bare walls' amplitudes were remarkably close, due to leaf shedding, a desirable feature to improve temperatures within the house. The benefits of the green façade were clearer during spring and summer when the external surface temperature of the shaded wall was reduced by up to 9 °C compared to the bare wall, and its thermal amplitude varied by 8.4 °C, while the amplitude of the bare wall was more than double this value. The plant layer diminished the heat flux through the external wall by up to 22.3 W/m2 during the summer, and 8 W/m2 during the winter. These results show the potential of a low-cost green façade to improve the thermal comfort of green affordable housing projects.",

        "abstract": "Most of the global population are urban, with inhabitants exposed to raised levels of pollution. Pollutants negatively impact human wellbeing, and can alter the structure and diversity of ecosystems. Contrastingly, urban biodiversity can positively contribute to human wellbeing. We know little, however, about whether the negative impacts of pollution on wellbeing could be lessened for householders living on more biodiverse streets, as the complex interlinkages between pollution, biodiversity and wellbeing have rarely been examined. Here, we used structural equation modelling to simultaneously test whether biodiversity (actual and perceived) mediates the relationship between traffic-related pollution (noise, dB; nitrogen dioxide, NO2) or air pollution (PM2.5) and wellbeing (mental wellbeing, happiness). In summer 2019, we conducted questionnaires and biodiversity surveys, and collected noise and air pollution data, from households (n = 282) across the streetscapes of Leeds, UK. Biodiversity (actual or perceived) showed no mediating effects. However, increased flowering plant richness was positively associated with mental wellbeing. Traffic-related pollution negatively affected pollinator and flowering plant richness, but not wellbeing. This could be because householders are not exposed to high levels of noise or NO2 because they do not maintain front gardens on noisier streets. There was no measurable effect of air pollution on biodiversity or wellbeing. These findings shed light on the complex mechanisms through which biodiversity could improve human wellbeing. Enhancing the diversity of plant species in streetscapes would have a positive effect on wellbeing, further emphasising the important role that biodiverse urban streetscapes play in improving the liveability of cities.",

The parallel mediation model framework to assess the effects of predictors (traffic-related and streetscape air pollution) on wellbeing outcomes (mental wellbeing and happiness), via potential mediators (actual versus perceived richness for each taxa). Actual pollinator richness was assessed by morpho-functional group richness. Richness of pollinators = butterfly symbol, flowering plants = flower symbol, trees = tree symbol. a path = tested direct associations between predictor and mediators. b paths = tested direct associations between mediators and wellbeing outcomes. c paths = tested direct associations between predictors and wellbeing outcomes. The indirect effect (ab) is the product of the a and b paths. 2.10. Data analysis 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive statistics Table 1. Summary of predictors, wellbeing outcomes, mediators and covariates used in the parallel mediation models (Fig. 2). Traffic-related pollution, air pollution, actual biodiversity (pollinators, flowering plants, trees) and greenness (NDVI) were measured within 30 streetscapes in Leeds, UK. Wellbeing outcomes, perceived biodiversity (pollinators, flowering plants, trees) and remaining covariates were derived from questionnaires from 282 households across the 30 streetscapes. Actual pollinator richness was assessed by morpho-functional group richness. Flowering plant richness values are sum from two visits per streetscape. Tree richness values are the total number counted per streetscape. Perceived species richness values are the average across all questionnaire responses within a streetscape. Gender was a categorical covariate (see Table A.2). IQR = interquartile range.

Introduction Public open space is an open piece of land, allowing people of different generations to seek coherent social relations and socialization (Lipton, 2002). Green open spaces and parks in urban areas can be defined as a piece of land covered by greenery, such as the sports field, park, and other green open spaces of any size (Lipton, 2002, Tzoulas et al., 2007). Public open spaces and parks provide different health, social, and environmental benefits to the cities and communities (Miller, 2007). However, modern life, urbanization, mobility, density, and communication developments Abstract: United Nations propounded the key to sustainable development, including the Environmental health and social well-being of society. In the city planning and development, public urban green open spaces provide opportunities for social and physical activities among the communities, which can contribute to mental and physical health in improving the social well-being of the community. Iraq is currently suffering from poor social activities, as many open spaces and parks are neglected and deficient. Therefore, there is a need to enhance residents’ social interaction in public urban green open spaces in order to improve the quality of social fabric in Baghdad City, through the perspective of the sustainable built environment approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic and investigate the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City. The study employed by executed the survey to the communities in Karkh district. Respondents (n=306) were selected in a single-random procedure to assess population attitudes towards a pocket park for social and physical activities. The results confirmed that a lack of outdoor daily social interaction in Baghdad City due to the inefficient nearby pocket parks. Thus, there is a need for efficient pocket parks designed to be provided. In this study, the characteristics of efficient pocket park design identified as providing suitable activities and elements, accessibility, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance in the pocket park design. This study contributes to the definitions of pocket parks and nearby open spaces by investigating these spaces' characteristics and benefits towards the social well-being of communities, in achieving the goal of a sustainable community in sustainable city development.   Keywords: Sustainable city, social sustainable, urban green spaces Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     203 have caused the degradation of urban green space, which led to the demotion of social ties and interaction levels among urban communities (Nezlek et al., 2002, Miller, 2007). Social interaction refers to the bonds of relationship between two or more individuals in the community; it unites and coordinates the communities (Williams, 2006; Adegun, 2018). Although modern technologies are designed for people's interaction, some of these technologies have resulted in increased social isolation of communities (Nezlek et al., 2002; Rasidi et al., 2012). Furthermore, the obvious negligence in public open spaces and nearby parks also reduces the quality of communities and urban areas' lives in many ways, including social interactions (Currie, 2016, Do et al., 2019, Eissa et al., 2019).  Pocket parks and small scale open spaces that are of proximity to people’s residence and work provide the settings for well-being, social and ecological interactions (Williams, 2006; Nordh et al., 2009). In recent years, pocket parks have become one of the most recognized small open spaces, designed primarily for people's interaction and well-being. They are small-scale parks of not more than 4000m2 and are located within 500m walking distance, which provides social and recreational opportunities for different age groups (Peschardt et al., 2012; Currie, 2016; Abd El-Aziz, 2015). Pocket parks have become necessities and should not be looked upon as mere amenities as they provide the necessary greenery for a small group of people for outdoor activities and relaxation in a green environment (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Peschardt, 2014; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Their design approach is an essential characteristic of the strength of a community's social interaction. Design characteristics such as proximity, accessibility, elements, and location also greatly influence the patterns of socialization and use (Williams, 2006, Peschardt et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2014). The frequency and increased use of these spaces are crucial to creating frequent interactions among different users (Rasidi et al., 2013, Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Such pocket spaces are vital to assist in public welfare, encourage social interactions and express modern societal behavioral patterns (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2017a). Improving these pocket spaces also contributes to the communities' overall well-being, safety, and public health (Armato, 2017; Kim and Jin, 2018, Salih and Ismail, 2018b). However, location, climate, culture, and community needs have a critical effect on pocket parks’ characteristics, which in turn affect users' interactions and activities (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Sociodemographic of pocket parks' uses also play a critical role in their social experiences and preferences to pockets' characteristics (Salih and Ismail, 2018b).    2.  Public Urban Green Space in Baghdad Baghdad City has been a social, cultural and historical centre for different civilizations since its establishment by Abbasid al-Mansur in 766 AD. The city has been characterized by its unique types of green open spaces, such as gardens, small parks, orchards; Baghdad also characterized by cultural and social diversity (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). From 566 to 1800 AD, Abbasid and Ottoman introduced new methods of recreation by constructing the oldest zoo in 797 during Harun al-Rashid’s ruling, horsemanship, golf, ships races, promenade, and so on (Salih and Ismail, 2017a). The early 20th century was synonymous with many types of public parks that appeared as an essential component in Baghdad City, including small nearby parks for daily activities and large public parks and open spaces for festivals and weekend activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017). Consequently, these spaces have contributed to Baghdad’s social development by enhancing social and community cohesion. Where the society of Baghdad consisted of people from different backgrounds, religious and ethnic sects. These different backgrounds of people had grown under great social awareness, where they used to utilize public spaces for various social and cultural activities (Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b, 2018a).  In the 1950s, Baghdad City consisted of various types of public parks included five large multi-use parks, 21 neighborhood parks, 33 pocket parks, nine playgrounds, dozens of orchards, and a forest of several acres (Al-Jubouri, 2017). However, most of these open spaces and small parks have become dumping sites, water collection areas, are closed, or suffering from the lack of maintenance and management since 2003 (JAU et al., 2011). Many of these open spaces, parks, recreational and community spaces have also been converted into commercial buildings or have been reduced. Since 2003, Baghdad City has suffered from losing social capital (social relationships) and neglecting many vital-buildings and public spaces (Ihsanoglu, 2007). Crisis aggravated between different ethnicities in Iraq, resulting in a decline of interaction between residents (Rydgren and Sofi, 2011). Thus, local citizens of Baghdad tend to shop, work and socialize in their residential neighborhood, where interaction and recreational opportunities are limited (JAU et al., 2011). Moreover, data and studies regarding social life, public open spaces, and pocket parks are few, and there is also a lack of detailed statistics regarding the number and condition of pocket parks available in Baghdad City, which urges a need for further extensive examining (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017). Existing cross-section surveys and empirical studies confirmed that small and pocket parks in the City are limited, out of use, and do not meet people's needs for daily activities (Rikabi and Ali, 2013; Al-Jubouri, 2017; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between availability and design characteristics of pocket parks and the social interaction of Bagdad residents of different sociodemographic. The aim the current study is to determine the preferred characteristics of pocket parks for enhancing residents' social interaction based on their socio-demographic. The study also investigates the relationship between the availability of quality pocket parks and residents' social interaction in Baghdad City.  Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  204 3.  Research Methodology 3.1  Area and Samples of the Study This study utilized a quantitative survey as basic tools to collect the data from the residents of Baghdad utilizing the recommendation of Creswell and Clark (2017). The questionnaire survey aimed to investigate the attitudes of the Baghdad community toward the availability and characteristics of the nearby pocket parks in enhancing their daily social interaction. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and located along the Tigris River, which runs through the midpoint of the city, dividing it into two parts; Karkh, the western shore of Tigris, and Rusafa, the eastern coast of Tigris (Salih and Ismail, 2018b). Karkh is a historical district of Baghdad and Iraq. It has the primary resources, public, and educational facilities in the country (Al-Jubouri, 2017); thus, it was selected as the study area. It consists of ten basic sections; its total area is about 2,650 Km2. Before 2003, Baghdad consisted of approximately 55 small public parks spread in both Karkh and Rusafa (Al-Jubouri, 2017); however, most of these small public parks were off-limit, closed, or neglected since 2003 (IAU et al., 2011; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). Therefore, one site of the available pocket parks from each section of the Karkh district was included as a study area. Four of these pockets were the main assembly pocket areas in the Amiriyah, Mansur, Jihad, and Salhiah neighbourhoods. Besides, the Ghazaliya Park from Ghazaliya, Hindawi Park from Saydiya, Yarmouk Local Park from Yarmouk, Ilam Community Park from Dora, Bayaa Pocket Park from Bayaa, and Utaifiyya Community Park from Utaifiyya were also included as a study area representing small pocket parks in each section of Karkh (see Figure 1). Participants of the study were selected randomly from the ten sites and based on the simplified formula of Yamane (1967), as shown below in Equation 1. Where n is the sample size, N is the population size (N = 1,300,000), and e is the level of precision (e = ±5%). According to the Ministry of Planning, the population of Karkh district in 2009 was about 1,300,000 individuals (Ministry of Planning of Iraq, 2009; Salih et al., 2020). Therefore, 306 participants (aged 18 and over) were the final participants in this study after being selected in a single-stage randomly (Creswell and Clark, 2017) from the mentioned sites. About 60 pocket park users refused to participate in the survey, and four did not complete the questionnaire form correctly. The on-site survey was conducted between April and June 2017 during weekdays and weekends in the morning and evening.   Equation 1. Simplified formula for Proportions (Source: Yamane, 1973)    Fig. 1 - Map of the ten selected areas in Karkh, Baghdad (Source: Salih and Ismail, 2018b)    Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     205 3.2 Design and Procedure of the Study A questionnaire survey using closed-ended questions was operated in this study. It is a simple and efficient method of obtaining data from a widely scattered sample in a short period (Mathers et al., 2009). Mathers et al. (2009) and Creswell and Clark (2017) recommendations were used to design the closed-ended questions of the current study, which were prepared in both languages of Arabic and English and comprised three pages for each version. A brief definition of the pocket park and the goal of the study were described on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then divided into three parts regarding the variables of the study; the first part covered the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (participants variable), encompassing their gender, age group, occupation, and income level. The gender included 1= males and 2= females. The age groups included age ranges 1= 18 to 24, 2= 25 to 31, 3= 32 to 38, 4= 39 to 46, and 5= 47 to 65 years old. The occupation included 1= unemployed, 2= students, and 3= employed. The income level included 1= low-income level (≤1,000,000 IQD per month), 2= middle-income level (1,000,000-3,000,000 IQD per month), and 3= high-income level (≥3,000,000 IQD per month). The age groups, occupation status, and income levels were selected according to the previous social studies (Hecke et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2020) and recommendations of Mathers et al. (2009).  The second part of the questionnaire included measuring respondents’ social interaction in outdoor pocket spaces (dependent variable) using the statement “Do you practice daily outdoor social activity in nearby open spaces/pocket parks?” The third part of the questionnaire measured the availability of pocket parks in the selected sites (independent variable) using the statement “Is there an efficient pocket park in the neighborhoods where you (participant) live?” A three-point scale was used for first and second statements; value 1= Yes, value 2= No, value 3= don't know (Mathers et al., 2009; Salih and Ismail, 2018b). The last part of the questionnaire included measuring six design characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable). The pocket parks' characteristics were carefully selected from the existing studies (Peschardt and Stigsdotter, 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Hecke et al., 2018). The six characteristics included design, elements and activities, accessibility, safety and security, proximity, and administration and maintenance. Accessibility referred to clear and direct access to and in these pockets (Abd El-Aziz, 2015), while proximity referred to providing nearby pockets where people live and socialize. These characteristics were measured using a five-point Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree. Rating and Likert-scales are usually using to measure community attitudes and public approval in survey studies, which vary from two to ten points (Sheatsley, 1983; Joshi et al., 2015). All participants also gave informed consent before applying the survey and related procedure.  3.3 Data Analysis  The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23, an absolute comprehensive statistical computer tool to analyze social studies data (Creswell and Clark, 2017). Descriptive and frequency statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean and standard division, were utilized to analyze the participant sociodemographic characteristics (participants’ variable), outdoor social interaction (dependent variable), and pocket parks' availability and characteristics (independent variable). In addition, the inferential statistic of one-way ANOVA was used to test the relationship between the pocket parks' availability and characteristics and both outdoor social interaction and sociodemographic characteristics.  3.4 Respondents' Demographic Characteristics In total, 306 participants were involved in the current survey study. Female participants made up 51.6% of the total sample, while male made up 47.7% of the total sample. Meanwhile, 39.9% of the participants were between 18 and 24 years, while 25.5% were between 25 and 31 years. 16.3% were between 32 and 38 years, 12.4% were between 39 and 46 years, and only 5.9% of them were between 47 and 60 years. For occupation distribution, most of the participants (49.3%) were students, 41.8% were employed, and only 8.8% were unemployed. For income level, most of the participants (78.4%) were middle-income class, 15.7% high-income class, and only 5.9% low-income class.  4. Finding  4.1 Availability of Pocket Parks and Social Interaction in the City of Baghdad Frequency and multiple comparison analysis were used to measure the availability of people’s social interaction and an efficient pocket park in neighborhoods where people lived. Table 1 shows that only 14.7% of the respondents are practicing daily social interaction outdoor in the nearby pocket parks of the Karkh district. In contrast, most of the respondents (81.7%) were not practicing daily social activities in the nearby pocket parks of Karkh district, while there were two missing answers for this statement. For 76.4% of the respondents, a small park in the neighborhood where they live was not available or inefficient. Only 19.3% of the respondents had an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived (see Table 1). Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  206 Table 1 - Multiple comparisons for the availability of pocket parks and respondents’ social interaction  Availability of efficient small park in the neighborhoods Total N(%) Sig.

One-way ANOVA in Table 1 shows a statistically significant association between respondents’ daily social interaction outdoor and the availability of efficient small parks in neighborhoods where they lived (p= 0.000). The results of multiple comparisons in Table 1 also show that most respondents (73.8%) reported that they did not practice daily outdoor social interaction where they did not have an efficient small park in the neighborhood where they lived. This result indicated that the availability of nearby pocket park is essential to enhance outdoor social interaction.  4.2 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics for Social Interaction in Baghdad City  Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to measure the nearby pocket park's preferred characteristics in the City of Baghdad (independent variable). The highest mean score has registered for the elements and activities characteristics (in term of availability of a good quality of softscape and hardscape elements and various types of activities; Mean= 4.01 ±0.976), which referred to the value \"agree\". The frequency in Table 2 shows that most of the respondents (45.1%) agree that elements and activities are an essential characteristic of pocket parks, while only 7.2% of them disagreed with this statement. Followed by mean scores of accessibility (Mean= 4.00 ±0.969), design (Mean= 3.94 ±0.992), proximity (Mean= 3.92 ±0.972), and safety and security (Mean= 3.87 ±0.995). Whereby most of the respondents agreed that accessibility (50.0%), design (48.4%), proximity (53.3%) and safety and security (45.4) were essential characteristics of pocket parks design. In contrast, few respondents disagreed that accessibility, design (6.9%), proximity (9.5%) and safety and security (8.8%) were important characteristics of pocket parks design. On the other hand, the mean value of administration and maintenance was 3.83 ±1.012, where 43.1% of the respondents agreed that administration and maintenance were an important characteristic, and 13.1% of them disagreed with this statement (Table 2). Overall, the small standard deviation (<1) referred to a low spread of respondents' responses out around the mean (a little amount of variation in the answers). At the same time, the larger standard deviation (>= 1) referred to a higher amount of variation in the answers.

One-way ANOVA test in Table 2 shows that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the six characteristics of pocket parks and respondents' outdoor social interaction (p< 0.01). The results in Figure 2 show that most of the respondents who \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that all the six characteristics are essential for pocket parks design were not practicing daily social interaction outdoors. This result indicates that respondents who suffered from the lack of daily social interaction outdoor tended to strongly agree or agree that the six characteristics of pocket parks are essential for their daily activities.   Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214  208  Fig. 2 - Outdoor social interaction based on pocket parks’ characteristics  4.3 Pocket Parks’ Characteristics based on Demographic Characteristics  One-way ANOVA also used to test the statistically significant differences between the six characteristics of pocket parks (independent variable) and respondents' demographics (participants variable) including, age groups, gender, occupation, and income level. ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between the mean scores of respondents' gender and characteristics of elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity (p<0.05, see Table 3). This result indicates that respondents of different gender have different opinions on elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of nearby pocket parks. One-way ANOVA analysis also showed a significant difference between the mean score of respondents' age and design characteristics (p= 0.003) and respondents' income level and elements and activities (p= 0.046, see Table 3). The result in Figure 3 shows that female respondents have more concern about the pocket parks elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity. Figure 3 also shows that respondents of different age groups have different opinions on the importance of the design factor. In addition, respondents of higher incomes have agreed that elements and activities are essential in pocket parks design. However, there were no other statistically significant differences between the other characteristics of pocket parks and other demographics of respondents.

Discussion  The availability of pocket parks established with good characteristics is critical to promote daily social interaction (Gibson and Canfield, 2016; Salih and Ismail, 2018a; Tabassum, 2018; Salih et al., 2020). However, pocket park criteria could vary according to pocket location and climate, as the perception of users from these pockets differed from one city to another, from region to region and so on (Sinou and Kenton, 2013; Salih et al., 2020). The result of this study showed that outdoor daily social interaction in nearby pockets in Baghdad City was almost nonexistent. Most of the residents of Baghdad City were suffering from the lack of daily social interaction outdoors due to a lack of efficient nearby pocket parks in their neighborhoods. This result is consistent with the findings of JAU et al. (2011) and Salih and Ismail (2017a) who confirmed that there is a lack of social-recreational activities, public open spaces, and public parks in Baghdad. Salih and Ismail (2017a, 2017b) confirmed that provide quality public parks with legible elements and influential characteristics in Baghdad has become a complicated challenge nowadays. Yet, green open space can be a critical place that allows people to meet on a natural ground and interact with each other within the context of the community (Salih and Ismail, 2017b).  This study also found that the availability of various activities and good quality of softscape and hardscape elements was the most influential characteristic of the social interaction of Baghdad residents in nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the findings of Nordh et al. (2009) and Kim and Jin (2018) who found that hardscape and softscape elements of the pocket park are critical characteristics to attract people to use these spaces. For instance, the percentage of grass and ground, and the number of trees and shrubs are important variables affecting users' restoration and well-being (Nordh et al., 2009; Mahmoud and Omar, 2015). Furthermore, pocket parks that house various activities and elements can attract more users for beneficial social interactions and physical activities (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). However, a study conducted by Baur and Tynon (2010) confirmed that pocket parks are very small spaces that provide the necessary greenery for a specific activity for a small group of people. One possible explanation for these different results may that pocket park size varies from a few square meters to about 4000m2 and this could determine the type and number of activities (Salih and Ismail, 2017a).  The elements and activities were followed by accessibility as a critical characteristic to promote the social interaction of Baghdad residents in pocket parks. This result seemingly supported the results of the previous studies, which confirmed that accessibility is a key characteristic that contributes to the success of small nearby public open spaces (Baur and Tynon, 2010; Abd El-Aziz, 2015; Salih and Ismail, 2017b; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, pocket parks must be easily accessible by walking and bike-riding and by providing clear entrance and paths (Abd El-Aziz, 2015).  Apart from that, in this study identified that the characteristics of well-design, proximity, safety and security, and administration and maintenance were also mentioned as important factors that contribute to promoting the socialization of Baghdad residents in the nearby pocket parks. This result is similar to the results of the previous literature, which found that green open spaces’ characteristics can include design, safety, security, maintenance, and administration (Uslu and Gokce, 2010; Kara et al., 2011; Skip et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2018a). Moreover, results of Peschardt et al. (2012) and Abd El-Aziz (2015) showed that pocket parks should be located within 400m walking distance from residences and should not require the use of a car to reach them. The previous studies also confirmed that various influential characteristics of pocket parks' can contribute to promoting social activity and park visitation (Cohen et al., 2014; Gibson and Canfield, 2016). Furthermore, providing successful management and maintenance of small natural parks in the low-income neighborhood may improve the quality of life for their residents (Baur and Tynon, 2010). The findings of the current study contribute to the existing literature, as these studies revealed that security, administration, and maintenance were key factors to be achieved in public open spaces to enhance a sound social interaction. Therefore, the existence of pocket parks with the aforementioned characteristics clearly contributed towards the social interaction among Baghdad residents.  On the other hand, the result showed that female respondents have more concern about the elements and activities, accessibility, and proximity of pocket parks in Baghdad City. The current study also found that people of different age groups and income levels have different opinions on the importance of the design, elements, and activities in the nearby pocket parks. This is similar to the results of existing studies which confirmed that parks’ characteristics affect and depend on the users’ characteristics, such as age and gender (Cohen et al., 2014; Salih and Ismail, 2017b). However, the study of Nordh et al. (2009) mentioned that responses across different groups of people (e.g. age and gender) with parks and nature were relatively homogenous. This different result may be due to the social-cultural diversity of different respondents from different studies.  6.   Conclusion In conclusion, nearby pocket parks contribute to efficient and low-cost green spaces to enhance daily activities. Well-designed pocket parks are essential to enhance the local community's needs and promote social, mental, and environmental benefits. However, Baghdad City lack well-designed small parks, which had a negative impact on the residents’ outdoor socialization. Providing adequate pocket parks in Baghdad City is essential to promote their Sarah Abdulkareem Salih et al., International Journal of Sustainable Construction Engineering and Technology Vol. 12 No. 3 (2021) p. 202-214     211 residents' social interactions. The successful pocket parks in Baghdad should provide accessibility, good activities and elements, well-design, proximity, safety and security, administration and maintenance. The users' demographics, like age and gender, could also affect their preferences for pocket parks. The study results contribute to integrating social interaction in nearby open spaces and pocket parks, and this provides a useful reference for landscape and urban planners, architects, and Baghdad City policymakers.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"The Sustainable City: The Characteristic Public Urban Green Space for Enhancing Community Social Sustainability in Baghdad\" explores the intricate interplay between urban green spaces and community well-being, specifically in the context of Baghdad. The authors argue that well-designed public green spaces significantly contribute to social sustainability, which is a broader interpretation of community well-being. The relevance of this work to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being lies in its comprehensive examination of social sustainability metrics such as community interaction, mental health benefits, and the ability of these spaces to foster a sense of belonging and social cohesion. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating that access to urban green spaces in Baghdad leads to increased social interactions among community members. They utilize both qualitative and quantitative research methods to gather data through surveys and interviews focusing on how residents perceive and engage with these spaces. This directly supports the claim by outlining the positive effects of urban greenery on community dynamics. The study cites that, \"Public urban green spaces provide opportunities for leisure, recreation, and social interaction, which are key to enhancing inhabitants' quality of life and social bonds.\" Such findings align with body of research asserting that green environments offer psychological benefits, which ultimately contribute to overall community well-being. \n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed in the study is robust, involving case studies and field surveys across multiple neighborhoods in Baghdad. The data collection methods include structured questionnaires, direct observations, and focus group discussions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the residents' interactions with green spaces. The combination of qualitative feedback and quantitative data enhances the reliability and validity of the results. Moreover, the statistical analysis carried out ensures that the findings are backed by solid evidence, further solidifying the paper's credibility regarding the link between urban green spaces and community well-being. \n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings presented in the paper significantly contribute to the discourse on urban planning and community development. The authors stress that integrating green spaces in urban infrastructure not only aids in ecological sustainability but is critical in enhancing the quality of urban life. The conclusion drawn emphasizes that cities should prioritize green initiatives as fundamental to social sustainability. As stated, \"The integration of green spaces in urban settings acts as a catalyst for fostering community well-being, influencing both social interactions and residents' mental health positively.\" This perspective challenges traditional urban planning paradigms, advocating for a holistic approach that considers environmental and social dimensions as intertwined. \n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: While the study presents significant insights, it also acknowledges limitations such as the socio-economic diversity of Baghdad residents not being fully represented. The research might lean towards the perspectives of a specific demographic, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings across different contexts. Furthermore, potential biases might arise from the environmental conditions unique to Baghdad, which may not accurately reflect the ecological benefits of urban green spaces in varying cultural or geographical landscapes. The authors suggest further studies to explore these aspects across different urban settings, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of urban green spaces as a tool for fostering community well-being. Overall, the paper contributes meaningful insights to the broader conversation regarding the importance of planning for green spaces to enhance community welfare and social sustainability.",

Soil protective management practices, such as applying compost, mulch or avoiding soil tilling, should be included in urban green space planning to improve urban biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people.Maintaining functional and biodiverse urban green spaces is fundamental for liveable cities (cf. SDG 111). Urban gardens are a major component of urban green spaces in many countries2,3. They are heterogeneous in structure, but despite their relatively small size they provide critical habitat resources and increase the connectivity of urban landscapes4. Garden management creates diverse garden land-use types including perennially vegetated habitats such as lawns or annually vegetated habitats such as vegetable beds2. These diverse microhabitats support urban biodiversity and have the ability to provide nature’s contributions to people5,6. The worldwide increase in human population is expected to take place mainly in urban areas7, while growing cities often expand onto fertile agricul-tural soils, thus challenging the supply of fresh food in the future8. There is a great potential for producing food in urban gardens and at the same time to provide other ecosystem services (ES) in densely populated cities9. It is estimated that urban farming delivers food for approximately 800 million people10, although the current global scale is difficult to assess11. However, hundreds of millions of citizens rely on urban agriculture for part of their nourishment12. Nonetheless, urban garden soils are also important for regulating soil functions such as water storage (flood control13), C and N storage14, pollination15, soil formation16, pest control17, or to decrease urban heat island intensity18 and provide habitats for many species even in densely urbanised areas6. From a sociological perspective, urban gardens are important for recreation, well-being, and social interaction19.Urban gardening has a long tradition in many countries around the world20. As a consequence of decades of beneficial soil management practices, such as the application of compost21, urban garden soils may not always 1Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Department of Soil Sciences, Ackerstrasse 113, 5070, Frick, CH, Switzerland. 2Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, Zürcherstrasse 111, 8903, Birmensdorf, CH, Switzerland. 3University of Neuchâtel, Institute of Biology, Functional Ecology Laboratory, Rue Emile-Argand 11, 2000, Neuchâtel, CH, Switzerland. 4ETHZ, Department of Environmental System Science, Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Universitaetstrasse 16, 8092, Zurich, CH, Switzerland. 5University of Konstanz, Department of Biology, Ecology, Universitätstrasse 10, 78464, Konstanz, DE, Germany.

Despite the importance of gardens for urban biodiversity6, information on the ecological importance of allotment and domestic gardens is still scarce compared to public green spaces2,23. However, there is a large body of evidence that biodiversity drives ecosystem processes and related services in aboveground communities24, but the functioning of belowground biodiversity is much less understood25. Although it has been shown that soil biodiversity is linked in multiple ways with aboveground biodiversity26,27, further investigation is needed to better understand these relationships. Garden soils are strongly influenced by human activities3,22,28, but they are also affected by the past land-use, the degree of disturbance or climate related drivers such as the urban heat island effect29. Soil functions are provided and controlled by a large variety of soil organisms30, also in urban soils28, where the frequency of soil disturbance is often high29. Changes in community composition of soil fauna in both alpha and beta diversity31, for instance due to soil disturbance, can impair soil functions such as organic matter decomposition or nutrient retention32. The interactions of aboveground and belowground species, driving ecosystem functions, at least at the local scale33, are mainly linked via plants34. However, still very little is known about this relationship between aboveground and belowground diversity and associated soil functions35, especially for garden soils36.The ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions, so-called multifunctionality24, can be calculated as indices based on the functions of interest37. Such measures of multifunctionality (i.e. the averaging approach), have been used to analyse a wide range of ecosystem drivers38, such as soil characteristics39, habitat diversity40, cli-mate41, or management practices in agriculture42 and even in constructed ecosystems such as green roofs43. Here, we focus on five independent measurements for calculating soil multifunctionality ranging from aboveground44 and belowground27 litter decomposition, to nutrient supply for plant growth45 and water regulation, such as water storage capability46.Research on urban garden soils has recently received increased attention3,17,28,47,48, especially with regard to human health and well-being29. However, our understanding of the complex interactions between management practices, soil biodiversity and soil functioning is still scarce49. In this study, we focus on gardening activities in the two most dominant garden types of Zurich (CH), allotment and domestic gardens, and assess the interactions between aboveground diversity of plants and belowground diversity of soil fauna. We investigated earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae), representing soil macrofauna species and springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola), rep-resenting soil mesofauna species, as indicators for soil functioning50 and assessed the impacts of urban gardening on soil multifunctionality. Earthworms are generally described as ecosystem engineers50, due to their impact on soil structure and quality, at least in temperate soils51. They are important indicator organisms for soil functions52, soil disturbance, and management practices50. It has been shown that also in urban ecosystems such as parks or urban gardens, they are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic management intensity47. Springtails are a key group of microarthropods50 and can be used as indicators of sustainable land-use, soil quality27, or the use of pes-ticides53. Moreover, they are used to assess soil functionality54 and the impact of environmental factors55 on soil biodiversity. In addition, we assessed soil microfauna by biological soil measurements, such as basal respiration, microbial biomass and gene copy numbers of bacteria and fungi (Table 1).The overall objective of our study was to investigate impacts of garden management practices (management intensity index, garden land-use types) on aboveground plant diversity and belowground diversity of soil fauna, and their direct and indirect effects on soil multifunctionality. We hypothesised (cf. a priori structural equation model (SEM) Fig. 1) that (i) intensive soil management will reduce the diversity of both plant and soil fauna and negatively affect soil multifunctionality (arrows 1 & 2). We assumed that (ii) aboveground and belowground diversity are also linked in urban garden ecosystems and therefore expected that a higher diversity of plants will have a positive effect on both soil fauna and soil multifunctionality (arrows 3). Furthermore, we expected that (iii) soil fauna diversity (arrow 4a) and biomass (arrow 4b) will have a direct positive effect on soil multifunctionality. Additionally, we assumed an influence of (iv) soil characteristics and (v) urbanisation on soil multifunctionality (arrows 5 & 6).In a second step, we analysed soil fauna community structure. We expected that frequently disturbed soils would have the lowest species diversity within (alpha diversity) and among (beta diversity) garden sites, includ-ing a high community evenness and beta diversity mainly driven by species loss (nestedness) rather than species replacement (turnover). For the plant community, we expected highest alpha and beta diversity for garden sites with high planting activities, including a high species turnover component for beta diversity. Furthermore, we investigated impacts of management practices on soil fauna community composition and on soil fauna distur-bance indices.ResultsUrban gardening effects on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. The SEM based on our a priori expectations (Fig. 1) of urban gardening effects on aboveground and belowground diversity and soil multifunc-tionality met the criteria of Fisher’s C statistic56 (Fisher’s C = 30.7; p = 0.80; AICc = 286.8). The model included one significant missing path57 between PC1 and soil fauna diversity (SEM; 0.18; p = 0.03). With the inclusion of this path the overall model fit of the SEM improved (Fisher’s C = 24.3; p = 0.93; AICc = 288.3), with marginal differences in the AICc (1.5). Overall, the strongest relationships in the SEM originated from garden land-use types, influencing plant diversity, fauna biomass and soil characteristics (PC2) and soil multifunctionality both in indirect and direct ways (Figs 2 and S10). The strongest effects on soil multifunctionality came from soil PC1 (SEM; −0.61; p =< 0.001), represented by lower loads of Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but higher soil bulk density values (Fig. S4). Soils with increased Cmic, Corg, bacteria, Fe and K, but lower bulk density values thus covaried with higher soil multifunctionality. Annual vegetable sites showed lower soil multifunctionality values (SEM; −0.40; p = 0.03) compared to perennial grass sites. Moreover, we found positive effects of plant diversity (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.01), and fauna biomass (SEM; 0.17; p = 0.02) on soil multifunctionality. Taken together, both signif-icant and non-significant effects explained 74% of the total variation of soil multifunctionality. In addition, we 4Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/also identified several indirect effects on soil multifunctionality (Fig. 2 and S10, Table S6). We found that plant diversity had a positive indirect effect on soil multifunctionality mediated by increased fauna diversity and fauna biomass. Plant diversity itself was positively affected by flower & berry sites (SEM; 0.37; p = 0.04) and negatively by management intensity (SEM; −0.22; p = 0.01), explaining 39% of the variation in plant diversity. A similar pattern was found in high beta diversity values (Table S5) for the plants (0.94 ± 0.001), dominated by a high turnover component (0.92 ± 0.001) and low nestedness component (0.02 ± 0.001), indicating the high variability between garden plots. Moreover, the management intensity indirectly negatively affected soil multifunctionality by decreasing fauna biomass and plant diversity (Fig. 2, Table S6). Plant and soil fauna beta diversity and fauna phylogenetic diversity were not included in the final SEM (cf. Table S10, Fig. S7) due to a large increase in the AICc (588.5) and because it explained only 3% more variance in soil multifunctionality (Fig. S8).Urban gardening effects on soil fauna community composition. We investigated the effects of man-agement practices, plant ecological indicators (Table 2), soil characteristics (Table 1), garden land-use types, and urbanisation on the community composition of both earthworms and springtails (Table 4). Both soil fauna groups were strongly affected by the plant ecological indicator nutrients (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.9; p =< 0.001, COL; F = 5.4; p =< 0.001), that represented the requirements of nutrient-rich soils for plants that are predominantly found in vegetable sites (Fig. 3). Earthworm communities were further affected by the penetration resistance of the soil (PERMANOVA EW; F = 5.3; p =< 0.001), favouring anecic species such as L. terrestris. Furthermore, plants indicating humus rich soils (PERMANOVA EW; F = 3.0; p = 0.01) favoured the two most abundant earth-worm species (Table S1, Fig. 3) A. chlorotica and A. caliginosa. Those soils were further associated with higher contents of Mg (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.1; p = 0.04) and K (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.7; p = 0.01), resulting from higher soil disturbance (PERMANOVA EW; F = 2.4; p = 0.02) predominantly in vegetable sites. In sum-mary, the NMDS ordination was driven by endogeic species A. chlorotica (NMDS; R2 = 0.30; p =< 0.001) and A. caliginosa (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001), anecic species L. terrestris (NMDS; R2 = 0.17; p =< 0.001), and both endogeic (NMDS; R2 = 0.20; p =< 0.001) and anecic (NMDS; R2 = 0.19; p =< 0.001) juveniles. Although the garden land-use type was not a significant factor affecting the earthworm community composition, the most abundant species can be allocated to specific land-use types (Fig. 3, Table S1). In vegetable sites we primarily found endogeic species such as A. chlorotica (64.5%), which is tolerant to disturbances28 and a pioneer species58, endogeic juveniles (41.9%) and A. caliginosa (45.1%). Perennial grass sites were dominated by anecic species such as L. terrestris (52.5%) and anecic juveniles (47.6%), probably due to deeper and more compacted soils. As Figure 2. Final most parsimonious SEM connecting garden management (land-use types, management intensity), urbanisation, plant and soil fauna diversity with soil multifunctionality (AICc = 288.3, Fisher’s C = 24.3, P = 0.93). Arrows represent unidirectional relationships among variables. Black arrows denote significantly (p < 0.05) positive and red arrows significantly negative relationships (Table 3). Dashed grey arrows represent non significant relationships (p > 0.05). The thickness of paths has been scaled based on the magnitude of the standardised regression coefficient. Conditional R2s, based on the variance of both the fixed and random effects, as well as marginal R2s, based on the fixed effect parts for each component models are given in the boxes of the response variables. Soil multifunctionality consists of five measurements related to important soil functions. Soil characteristics are included in Fig. S10.5Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/expected, we found the lowest earthworm diversity (DSimpson) in vegetable sites (1.85 ± 0.2) and the highest in grass sites (2.57 ± 0.2). The earthworm diversity was driven by endogeic and anecic species but not by epigeic species (Table 4). Additionally, we found the lowest beta diversity (βJAC) for earthworms in vegetables and the highest in grass sites (Fig. S5, Table S5). However, evenness (ESimpson) was not highest in vegetable sites but in grass sites and flower & berry sites, where we also observed higher nestedness components (βJNE).Springtails were affected by the plant ecological indicators moisture (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001) and moisture variability (PERMANOVA COL; F = 3.7; p =< 0.001). These indicate moist soil or alternating soil moisture conditions, favouring species that were more abundant in grass sites such as S. aureus (81.1%) or P. alba (67.3%) on soils with high penetration resistance (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.3; p = 0.01) and Cmic (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.1; p = 0.02). All three life forms of springtails were present in the species that had the biggest effect on the community composition (Table S4). B. hortensis showed the largest effect (NMDS; R2 = 0.29; p =< 0.001), and was most often found in vegetable sites (75.5%), where also C. thermophilus (NMDS; R2 = 0.13; p =< 0.001) was often present (56.7%), correlating with potassium loads (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001). Other species driving the community composition of springtails were mostly found in grass sites, such as P. notabilis (85.4%), representing the most abundant (22.9%) springtail species (13,435 individuals) in this survey. Moreover, we found eight springtails (marked with stars in Table S1) which were not included yet in the Fauna Europaea species list, with two new records for Switzerland (I. balteatus and I. graminis) according to the available literature and expert opinion (c.f. Table S1). The separation of flower & berry sites in the NMDS was mainly driven by C. denticulata (NMDS; R2 = 0.08; p =< 0.001). Moreover, we found a clear effect of garden land-use type (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.8; p =< 0.001), but also two significant effects of specific garden man-agement practices: applying water (PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.5; p =< 0.001) and weeding (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04). Weeding was more attributed to vegetable sites and applying water to grass sites in the NMDS ordination, whereas flower & berry sites were associated with a higher degree of urbanisation (PERMANOVA COL; F = 1.8; p = 0.04) and with more alkaline soils (basification; PERMANOVA COL; F = 2.0; p = 0.02). As expected, we found lower mean values for the springtail diversity (DSimpson, Table S2) in vegetable sites (3.3 ± 0.2) compared to grass sites (3.8 ± 0.1). Beta diversity (βJAC) was highest for flower & berry sites with a high turnover in comparison to the nestedness component (Fig. S5, Table S5). Springtail evenness (ESimpson) was highest in flower & berry sites, where we also found the highest nestedness component (βJNE), probably due to hemiedaphic and euedaphic species being more similar in flower & berry sites.Additionally, we found differences between garden land-use types in soil fauna disturbance indices. The col-lembolan ecomorphological index and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio were lowest in vegetable sites (Table S2). The acari to collembola ratio was lowest in grass sites and the fungal to bacterial ratio was highest in vegetable sites.DiscussionWorldwide, there is a growing interest of city administrations in the socio-economic and ecological benefits of urban gardens6,11,12,17,23,29,59. We investigated impacts of garden management practices on aboveground and belowground diversity and interlinked soil functions. The SEM (Fig. 2, Table 3) revealed direct effects on soil multifunctionality and indirect effects mediated by soil fauna. Overall, our results showed that the largest effects on soil multifunctionality were caused by specific soil characteristics. Soils showing high biological soil quality indices such as organic and microbial carbon and bacteria increased the potential for soil multifunctionality. This probably originates from organic gardening practices such as the application of compost, due to the correlation with increased potassium loads and with decreased bulk density values (Table 3, Table 1), also influencing soil Variables DescriptionManagement practicesDisturbance Frequency of soil disturbanceFertiliser Frequency of fertiliser applicationManagement intensity Garden management intensity gradientPesticides Frequency of pesticide applicationWater Frequency of water applicationWeeding Frequency of weedingPlant ecological indicator valuesAeration Supply of oxygen in the soil (from poor (0) to good (1))Basification Soil content of H+-ions (from acid (0) to alkaline (1))Humus Dark organic matter content (humus) (from little (0) to high (1))Moisture Soil moisture during the growing season (from dry (0) to wet (1))Moisture variability Alternating soil moisture (from less (0) to often (1) alternating)Nutrients Soil nutrient availability (from low (0) to high (1))Root depth Depth of soil root penetration (from shallow (0) to deep (1))Table 2.

The second strongest effect on soil multifunctionality was caused by the cultivation of vegetables and legumes in annual vegetable sites (hypothesis (i), Fig. 1 arrows 1a), probably due to the frequent soil disturbance and the unprotected open soils in comparison to perennial grass sites. The cultivation of flowers and berries increased plant diversity (Fig. 1 arrows 1b), but decreased soil fauna biomass compared to grass sites. Urban gar-dens with higher plant diversity (hypothesis (ii), Fig. 1 arrows 3) increased soil multifunctionality directly, and indirectly through increasing fauna diversity and thus fauna biomass. The general pattern of enhanced soil mul-tifunctionality with increased plant diversity is in line with results found in other ecosystems such as croplands, shrublands, grasslands, and forests, where plant diversity increased ES such as pollination, C storage, pest control, and productivity60,61. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant direct effect of management intensity on soil multifunctionality, but more intensively managed sites decreased plant diversity and fauna biomass.

Lerman et al.62 showed that mowing only every three weeks instead of every week increased the numbers of flowers by 2.5 times and thus the abundance and diversity of bee populations. Although Tresch et al. showed that aboveground63 and belowground22 organic matter decomposition increased with urbanisation, there was no significant effect of urbanisation (hypothesis (v), Fig. 1 arrow 5), on soil multifunctionality.The structure of earthworm and springtail communities were influenced by plant ecological indicators (Fig. 3, Table 3), representing the living conditions of plants. Interestingly, springtails were more affected by plant eco-logical indicators than earthworms, highlighting the dominant influence of plants on springtails50. As expected, we found a lower alpha diversity of earthworms and springtails in vegetable sites, likely due to the high soil distur-bance. Beta diversity was constantly high in both soil fauna and plant communities, driven by high turnover and low nestedness components. The plant community composition was shaped by the high species turnover between the garden sites, with highest dissimilarities for flower & berry sites. As expected, these significant differences originated most likely from planting and other garden management practices leading to site specific community compositions. The beta diversity values for both fauna communities were lowest in vegetable sites and peaked for earthworms in grass sites and for springtails in flower & berry sites, reflecting the different ecological strategies of earthworms and springtails.Earthworms are important indicators for soil functioning51,52. Functional groups of earthworms have been used to detect impacts of cultivation in different soils such as pastures, orchards or forest soils, while the ratio of anecic to endogeic species was used as an indicator of contaminated soils64, or soil disturbance65.

Other stud-ies have reported the highest value of the collembolan ecomorphological index in urban vegetable gardens and forest sites48. However, the highest value found in forest sites (2.3) was still considerably lower than the average we found in urban gardens of Zurich (5.8 ± 0.1), with a high number of euedaphic springtails such as P. pulvinata, F. quadriculata, and I. minor. Springtail abundance often increases from agricultural to forest sites66. Here they increased form vegetable to grass sites by a factor of 4.3. Besides soil disturbance, the increased abundance in grass sites could be explained by the higher plant cover of the perennially vegetated sites66 and because grass strips offer a variety of microhabitats for soil mesofauna species48. In contrast, Joimel et al.48 found higher mean densities in vegetable beds than forest or grassland sites, underlining the quality of urban gardens for soil fauna biodiversity and soil quality. In addition, the increased organic matter content in urban garden soils3 can be an important factor for the high soil fauna diversity, since the input of organic matter in garden soils can be higher than in agri-cultural fields67. Moreover, high management intensity is known to decrease soil mesofauna diversity68. We found a lower acari to collembola ratio in grass compared to flower & berry sites, which is in line with the dominance of acari in frequently disturbed arable or vineyard soils48. Additionally, we found a higher springtail biomass for grass sites, while earthworm biomass was at a similar and comparably high level in all urban garden land-use types. For instance, earthworm abundance (227.4 ± 15.5) was considerably higher than mean reference values for biological soil quality indicators found in grass or cropland soils69. Referring to all microorganisms68, Cmic peaked for grass sites, while the mean value (780.9 ± 21.3) was higher than in cropland soils (341 mg kg−1), but lower than in grassland soils (1249 mg kg−1) found in Belgium69 or Switzerland70 (2077 mg kg−1). This pattern of Cmic reflected management practices such as fertilisation or tillage68. Additionally, the composition of soil micro-organism communities is an important driver for soil functioning35. For instance, a shift in fungal composition or activity can increase carbon uptake and nutrient cycling35. Both soil disturbance71 or lower plant diversity72 Figure 3. Soil fauna community structure analysis of earthworms (a,b) and springtails (c,d). Soil fauna species are coloured in grey, corresponding to three ecological categories (Table S1). Only species with a significant (p < 0.001) effect (Table S4) and only significant explanatory variables (p < 0.05) from the PERMANOVA model (Table 1) were fitted. Garden land-use types include standard deviation bars.9Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/can result in decreased fungal to bacterial ratios. While increasing fungal to bacterial ratios can be expected from desert to temperate grassland and forest soils, assuming that grassland soils are more bacteria dominated than forest soils26. Here, we found an increased fungal to bacterial ratio for vegetable sites, due to the increased fungal and decreased bacterial gene copy numbers in those sites (cf. Table S9, Fig. S13). This might be related to the input of compost on the vegetable sites or the increased plant diversity compared to grass sites.The intuitive and rather simple concept of multifunctionality24 and its reduction to one single metric, such as the averaging approach37, needs to be examined critically. For example, the functions and methods to measure them must be carefully selected42. The strength of the biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depends on the number of included functions, which was generally stronger when more functions were con-sidered73. Another point is that the aggregation of multiple functions into one single metric can obscure infor-mation about potentially contrasting single functions74. The highest correlations among the soil functions (cf. Fig. S14) were found between Cmin and Nmin (r = 0.45, p =< 0.001), both used to calculate soil nutrient supply, and between Cmin and WHC (r = 0.43, p =< 0.001). All other correlations (r < 0.27) claimed a certain independence of the selected soil functions. The moderately positive correlation of all components to soil multifunctionality is required, because negative correlations among functions can be a limitation for multifunctionality assessments73. However, this multifunctionality assessment framework could also be used in future studies to assess the impact of managed urban green spaces on nature’s contributions to people in cities.With this city-wide assessment of the effect of urban gardening practices on aboveground and belowground diversity of plants and soil fauna, we demonstrated the potential impacts of gardeners’ decisions on the quality and functioning of the soil and implications on the biodiversity of a city. In conclusion, our study suggests that a higher plant diversity can directly or indirectly increase soil multifunctionality by enhancing soil fauna diversity and biomass. In a previous study, intensive garden management decreased soil quality indices22. Here we demon-strated that a high garden management intensity indeed also declined plant diversity and soil fauna biomass, with negative impacts on soil multifunctionality. In addition, we analysed drivers shaping soil fauna community structure of earthworm and springtail species. We showed that both were affected by plant ecological indicators, soil characteristics, and management practices such as the frequency of soil disturbance or applying water. We conclude that increasing plant diversity together with soil protective management practices have the potential to increase soil functions as well as foster biodiversity, and to create more biophilic59 urban gardens, supporting human well-being and the ecological value of urban green spaces. Even though soil is a key resource in cities, it has not been integrated in most urban green space plans75, thus we recommend that urban gardens including ecological management practices should be integrated in future green city strategies.MethodsStudy design and gradients. This study took place in 85 urban gardens of the city of Zurich, Switzerland (Fig. S1). We selected gardens based on three independent criteria22,76: (i) the type of garden (domestic N = 43 vs. allotment; N = 42 Fig. S2), (ii) the management intensity (such as intensively managed vegetable or flower beds or extensively managed meadows), and (iii) the degree of urbanisation, ranging from densely built-up to peripheral areas within the city boundaries. In each garden two sampling plots (2 m × 2 m) with different land-use management were selected (Table S12), belonging to one of the following three categories: annual vegetable beds (vegetables; N = 47), perennial flowers and berries (flowers & berries; N = 52) or perennial lawn and meadows (grass; N = 71), reflecting the most dominant garden land-use types in Zurich and in many other cities.Garden management practices were assessed using a questionnaire with 26 management questions, specific for each land-use type, ranging from the frequency of lawn cutting to fertiliser application or weeding (Table S3). Garden management intensity was assessed as the sum of 26 management questions. In addition, five common management practices (disturbance, fertiliser, pesticides, water, weeding; Table 2) were used in the commu-nity composition analysis. Urban warming was used as a proxy for urbanisation due to the correlation with the amount of built-up and paved area for different radii (30–500 m) around the gardens63. It has been assessed as the deviation in local mean air temperatures at night near the surface based on a local climate model77, showing temperatures increased of up to 5 °C for urbanised gardens.Aboveground diversity. Plant diversity was assessed by a floristic inventory78 of cultivated and spontane-ously growing plants on each sampling plot (N = 170). Based on this inventory of 600 plant species, we calculated plant alpha diversity as the total number of plant species per sampling plot and plant beta diversity as the mean of the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity comparisons between each focal plot and all other plots79. Additionally, we used a six-point ordinal scale78 to calculate community weighted mean values of seven plant ecological indicator values80 (Table 2), reflecting the plant environmental requirements81.Belowground diversity. Earthworms were collected in a smaller subplot of 0.3 m × 0.3 m within the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots by a combined hand sorting and mustard extraction method22. Earthworms were stored in 70% ethanol58, identified to the species level, and classified into three ecological categories (Table S1): epigeic species (living in the litter layer, with little burrowing activity), endogeic species (living in the soil, with horizontal burrows) and anecic species (living in large and deep vertical burrows).Springtails and mites were sampled with six undisturbed soil cores (5 cm diameter, 8 cm length, Eijkelkamp, NL) randomly taken in the 2 m × 2 m sampling plots63. Springtails were identified to the species level including life forms according to ecological and functional traits (Table S1): epedaphic species (living in the upper litter layer), hemiedaphic species (living at the interface between litter and soil) and euedaphic species (soil-dwelling species).1 0Scientific RepoRts |          (2019) 9:9769  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46024-ywww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/We defined soil fauna diversity as the average proportional species richness across soil macrofauna (earth-worms) and mesofauna (springtails) species following Allan et al.82. Soil fauna beta diversity was calculated as the average proportional species beta diversity of earthworms and springtails, while the individual measures of beta diversity per soil fauna group were computed as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities, similarly to the plant beta diversity. Soil fauna biomass was calculated as the average proportion of biomass per m2 of soil, with measured earthworm biomass [gm−2] on an individual basis (including gut contents) and estimated springtail biomass (conversion factor of 5 g for each springtail83).Soil fauna disturbance indices. The adaptation of soil fauna to management practices was assessed with four soil fauna disturbance indices: the collembolan ecomorphological index48, the acari to collembola ratio84, the fungal to bacterial ratio26, and the earthworm anecic to endogeic ratio64.Soil characteristics. Soil characteristics were assessed with a combination of three physical, six chemical and four biological soil measurements (Table 1), representing the most commonly used soil quality indicator measurements85. The microbial community information of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) gene copy numbers were used to calculate the fungal to bacterial ratio. Measurement details can be found in Table S13 and Tresch et al.86.Soil multifunctionality. Similar to other studies87 we used the averaging approach37 to calculate soil multi-functionality. It calculates the mean value across standardised soil functions for each sampling plot. In total, we used five measurements (Table S11), which are related to important soil functions, for the computation of soil multifunctionality. The three assessed key soil functions are (i) aboveground and belowground litter decompo-sition, (ii) soil nutrient supply, and (iii) soil water storage and regulation. The soil function litter decomposition aboveground was measured by standardised leaf litter mass loss (Zea mays L.) in 4 mm mesh sized litter bags63, while belowground litter decomposition was measured by the net mass loss of green tea bags, buried in 8 cm soil depth22. The supply of nutrients in the soil was assessed by the mineralisation rates of N (Nmin) and C (Cmin), and the capacity of the soil for water regulation, was measured by the water holding capacity (WHC).Data analysis. Soil fauna diversity and biomass were calculated by taking species richness per taxonomic group, applying a standardisation for each taxonomic group scaled to a range from 0 to 1 ( = −f x x x( ) ( )i min/ −x x( )max min ) and then averaging the values for each plot82. Aboveground and belowground beta diversity were calculated as mean pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities comparing each focal plot to all other sampling plots79 using the R package ‘betapart’88. Soil multifunctionality was computed by scaling each of the five measurements of soil functions to a range from 0 to 187 and deriving mean values across the standardised soil functions according to the averaging approach37. Community weighted means of plant ecological indicators were calculated with the R pack-age ‘FD’89.We fitted a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package57, to infer relative importance of direct and indirect effects of urban gardening, plant diversity, urbanisation and soil characteristics on soil fauna and soil multifunctionality. To address multicollinearity and reduce the amount of variables we applied a PCA for the soil characteristics and used the first four PCA axes, explaining 64.2% (Table 1; Fig. S4) of the variation (Kaiser-Guttman criteria). We used Shipley’s d-separation test to identify missing paths in the SEM and the AICC for model comparison. We used linear mixed effect models (LMEM; lme(nlme;90) with the garden as random effect for each SEM component and reported standardised (scaled by mean and variance) path coefficients, as well as marginal R2 and conditional R2 based on fixed and random effects57 (Table 3). Model assumptions were tested (Fig. S11) and potential spatial autocorrelation patterns were calculated with Moran’s I autocorrelation indices and the spatial structure in the model residuals using semivariograms (Fig. S12).We applied individual LMEM with garden identity as random effect and land-use types as response varia-bles to assess changes in fauna and plant diversity and soil fauna disturbance indices. We checked for normal distribution, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity of the model residuals and applied a transformation ( +xlog( 1)) in the cases of: earthworm biomass, anecic to endogeic ratio, acari to collembola ratio and spring-tail biomass. We reported means and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference posterior distribution based on 10,000 independent simulations91. Soil fauna community structure was further analysed using a per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, 10,000 permutations) with a Hellinger trans-formed Euclidean distance species matrix of earthworms (EW) and springtails (COL) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the ‘vegan’ package92. For the NMDS only significant variables from the PERMANOVA were fitted. Data management and statistical analyses are provided as an R project using R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017).References 1.

        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Direct and indirect effects of urban gardening on aboveground and belowground diversity influencing soil multifunctionality\" is highly relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. The authors investigate the interactions between urban gardening practices, plant and soil diversity, and their contributions to ecosystem services—an important aspect of community well-being. The research focuses on 85 urban gardens in Zurich, Switzerland, evaluating both the aboveground (plant species) and belowground (soil fauna) diversity as well as the management practices of these gardens. \n\n1. **Direct relevance to the claim**: This paper directly addresses the claim by articulating how urban gardens serve not only as green spaces but also as functional ecosystems that enhance biodiversity. The authors express that urban gardens can provide essential ecosystem services, including supporting biodiversity beneficial for the community. By establishing a connection between plant diversity and the well-being of soil fauna which is crucial for soil health, the authors highlight that fostering such diverse plant life in urban settings directly contributes to improved environmental conditions that enhance community well-being. The findings indicate that higher plant diversity leads to more effective soil functions (e.g., nutrient cycling and soil formation), which are integral to sustainable urban living. Thus, the analysis presented in the paper forms a critical basis for asserting that maintaining and promoting urban green spaces contributes positively to community well-being.\n\n2. **Methodology and evidence quality**: The research employs a robust methodology, assessing 170 garden sites across Zurich. It combines a variety of quantitative measurements, including the richness of plant species (600 species surveyed) and the diversity of soil fauna (18 species of earthworms and 39 species of springtails). This extensive field study utilizes scientifically sound sampling techniques and the corresponding statistical analysis, ensuring a high level of evidence quality. Furthermore, the use of diverse garden management practices allows the authors to evaluate direct effects on biodiversity and soil functionality clearly, which reinforces the reliability of the findings. The systematic approach to examining both aboveground and belowground components provides a holistic understanding of how urban gardening affects ecological functions and, by extension, community health.\n\n3. **Significance of findings**: The paper's findings carry significant implications. The authors conclude that urban gardening positively influences soil multifunctionality, which can improve urban ecosystem services, such as enhanced water retention, soil fertility, and even carbon sequestration. These services are essential for enhancing the quality of life in urban communities. The paper emphasizes that managed urban gardens can act as effective biodiversity hotspots, supporting not only ecological but also social and psychological dimensions of community well-being. Such findings encourage urban planners and policymakers to advocate for green space initiatives, thereby directly tying the research back to enhancing community well-being through the maintenance and development of urban gardens.\n\n4. **Limitations and potential biases**: Despite the strengths of the research, some potential limitations should be acknowledged. The study is geographically localized to Zurich, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other urban environments with different climates, cultural practices, and biodiversity. Furthermore, the focus on gardening activities might overlook other forms of urban green spaces (such as parks or wild areas), which may also contribute significantly to urban biodiversity and community well-being. Additionally, self-selection bias in participant gardens may have influenced the level of management intensity reported, which could affect the overall conclusion about plant diversity and its relationship to gardening practices. Future research could benefit from a broader scope, investigating diverse urban ecosystems to strengthen the understanding of the interactions between green spaces and community health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Promoting Urban Green Space (UGS) is one of the major requests of green cities for urban planners and local officials, and it is linked to myriad environmental and social benefits. However, scant literature has positioned the UGS into the background of fast regionalisation to unravel their relationships and mechanisms. This study delves into the impact and mechanisms of regional cooperation upon the provision of UGS in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), a dynamic city-region in southern China. Through social network analysis, panel data analysis, documentary review (analysis), and in-depth interviews, this study found that overall, regional cooperation has positive impacts on UGS provision in the GBA in the spheres of economic, social, institutional, and environmental affairs. We argued that economic cooperation encroaches on UGS by fostering infrastructure and economic zones; it also upgrades the industrial sectors and intensifies land use to positively affect UGS provision. Social cooperation reinforces population influx yet fosters social cohesion, sustainable lifestyles, and green economics to support the delivery of UGS policies. Environmental cooperation among local officials facilitates the implementation of urban greening projects, and institutional cooperation is conducive to urban governance in spatial greening planning. For the local government, the focal point for pursuing the green city vision is collaborative actions across the economic, social, environmental, and institutional spheres.",

BUREAU OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE Proposal Application    SECTION 1: ORGANIZATION INFORMATION  Submitted by:   Molly Vaziri Organization Name:  Developing Innovative Green Spaces to Tackle Urban Health Risks Organization Type:  NGO/Non-Profit Organization Address:  135 Dauer Dr. Chapel Hill, NC 27599   SECTION 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW  Urban areas often lack green spaces, which impacts residents' physical and mental health. The scarcity of parks and natural environments in densely populated cities contributes to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and diminished well-being. Our project proposes developing rooftop parks and gardens to address these issues, transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. The project begins by identifying suitable rooftops for park and garden development. This involves assessing structural integrity, accessibility, and potential community needs. Once appropriate sites are identified, the project moves into the design and construction phase, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The resulting rooftop parks will provide relaxation, recreation, and social interaction spaces.  Community engagement is a critical component of this project. By involving residents from the outset, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and ensure that the rooftop parks meet the community's specific needs. Activities include: • Training local volunteers to maintain the green spaces. • Organizing events to promote awareness. • Creating community-led groups to manage the parks' ongoing maintenance. The benefits of rooftop parks are significant. These green spaces offer urban residents a much-needed escape from city life, providing areas for exercise, relaxation, and social gatherings. The project also seeks to raise awareness about environmental sustainability by integrating educational programs and community activities that promote eco-friendly practices.  The community-driven approach fosters social cohesion and resilience, encouraging collaboration among residents. By involving the community in every project stage, from planning to maintenance, we aim to create a long-lasting impact on urban health and well-being.  Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the quality of life for urban residents, strengthen community ties, and contribute to creating more resilient and sustainable cities. By providing accessible green spaces in urban settings, this project represents a crucial step in addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and its impact on public health and community well-being.    2  SECTION 3: DETAILED PROJECT INFORMATION  1. Problem Statement:  Urban environments often suffer from a significant lack of accessible green spaces, leading to numerous health risks and exacerbating broader humanitarian issues. This scarcity contributes to physical health concerns such as heat-related illnesses, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, it triggers a rise in mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and social isolation (Geary et al., 2023). The limited availability of green spaces restricts opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, which are essential for the well-being of urban residents. The broader impact of this problem extends beyond individual health, affecting community resilience and environmental sustainability. Green spaces play a crucial role in mitigating environmental risks, such as air pollution and the urban heat island effect. They also offer a natural refuge from the stresses of urban life, providing a setting where residents can engage in outdoor activities or simply unwind from the pressures of city living. Despite their importance, millions of people in densely populated cities worldwide face limited access to parks and other green areas, impacting their quality of life and contributing to social inequalities. Research in reputable journals like The Lancet and Environmental Health Perspectives has established a strong link between green spaces and reduced rates of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and various mental health disorders (Rojas-Rueda et al. , 2016). Green spaces can also positively influence children's cognitive development and improve the overall quality of urban environments. Furthermore, global initiatives like the World Health Organization's Urban Green Spaces and Health program emphasize the role of green spaces in promoting public health and environmental quality (World Health Organization,2016). The lack of accessible green spaces also has significant social implications. The unequal distribution of parks and recreational areas often leaves marginalized communities without access to these vital resources, reinforcing existing social disparities. This unequal access undermines environmental sustainability, as green spaces are critical for regulating temperatures, reducing pollution, and promoting biodiversity. The absence of green spaces diminishes environmental quality and increases cities' vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Moreover, the lack of green spaces contributes to increased social isolation, particularly among older adults and children. This issue disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where access to green spaces is often more limited. The result is a cycle of health, social, and environmental inequity that perpetuates itself over time. Addressing the shortage of green spaces in urban areas is crucial for promoting social justice, human rights, and sustainable development. It aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to health, sustainable cities, and climate action. A community-based approach to developing and preserving green spaces can contribute to social cohesion and strengthen urban resilience. It can also create new economic opportunities through community-led initiatives and support efforts to tackle climate change. By prioritizing equitable access to green spaces, cities can foster a sense of community and improve public health outcomes. Addressing this shortage allows for greater inclusivity, ensuring that all residents can 3  benefit from nature's physical, mental, and social advantages within urban settings. Ultimately, green spaces should be viewed not just as amenities but as essential components of a healthy and sustainable urban infrastructure. Addressing this issue holistically not only improves individual health outcomes but also builds stronger, more inclusive communities capable of withstanding socio-economic and environmental stressors.    2. Description of the Solution:  Rooftop parks and gardens offer an innovative solution to the growing problem of limited green spaces in urban areas. As cities become increasingly crowded, these green areas effectively use underutilized rooftop spaces, providing accessible nature and recreational areas within dense urban landscapes. This approach addresses several critical issues simultaneously, fostering environmental sustainability, enhancing social cohesion, and stimulating economic growth. The concept of rooftop parks and gardens is rooted in the efficient use of existing infrastructure, a critical consideration in cities where available land is scarce and development pressures are high. By repurposing rooftops, we can create green spaces that serve multiple functions, from improving air quality to providing community gathering spaces. This innovative approach reduces the need to acquire additional land for green spaces, allowing cities to maintain their density while offering residents much-needed areas for recreation and relaxation.  Environmental Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens contribute significantly to environmental sustainability. These green spaces act as \"green lungs\" within the concrete jungle, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. They also help mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing natural cooling, which is crucial as global temperatures rise and cities become warmer. Rooftop greenery can reduce energy consumption by providing natural insulation, leading to lower heating and cooling costs for buildings. This, in turn, can reduce the overall carbon footprint of urban areas.  Additionally, rooftop parks and gardens contribute to improved water management in cities. They can act as natural rainwater catchment systems, reducing runoff and easing pressure on urban drainage systems. This helps to prevent flooding and promotes groundwater recharge, contributing to a more sustainable urban water cycle. Rooftop gardens can also support biodiversity by providing birds, insects, and other wildlife habitats in an otherwise sterile urban environment. This biodiversity aspect is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems within cities.  Social Benefits Beyond environmental sustainability, rooftop parks and gardens offer significant social benefits. Studies have shown that access to green spaces can improve mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. These spaces provide a respite from the noise and congestion of urban life, allowing residents to relax and connect with nature. Rooftop parks and gardens also serve as communal gathering spots, fostering social interaction and strengthening community bonds. These green spaces are precious in cities where social isolation is a growing concern. By creating environments that encourage people to come together, rooftop parks and gardens can help combat loneliness and promote a sense of belonging. They can also promote physical activity, as they offer spaces for exercise and recreation. This is particularly important in urban areas where traditional parks and open spaces are inaccessible. 4   Furthermore, rooftop parks and gardens can help bridge social divides by providing inclusive spaces where people from diverse backgrounds can meet and interact. This can foster greater understanding and tolerance among different groups, creating a more cohesive and harmonious urban community.  Economic Benefits Rooftop parks and gardens also offer significant economic benefits. They can enhance property values, making them an attractive feature for real estate development. A study by the National Association of Realtors found that proximity to parks and green spaces can increase property values by up to 20%. This increase in property values can increase cities' tax revenue, providing additional funding for public services and infrastructure.  Moreover, rooftop parks and gardens can create employment opportunities in construction and ongoing maintenance. This can stimulate local economies and provide landscaping, gardening, and park management jobs. These employment opportunities can be particularly beneficial in urban areas with high unemployment rates, offering a pathway for economic development and revitalization. Rooftop parks and gardens can also support local businesses by attracting visitors and encouraging foot traffic in urban areas. These green spaces can become popular destinations, drawing people from across the city and creating opportunities for retail and service businesses nearby. This can lead to a more vibrant urban economy and a higher quality of life for residents.  Theory of Change The theory of change underlying the adoption of rooftop parks and gardens revolves around their capacity to catalyze positive transformations across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By converting rooftops into green spaces, we can anticipate tangible improvements in air quality, urban heat island mitigation, and biodiversity conservation, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals.  Socially, these spaces can foster community cohesion, promote physical and mental well-being, and provide inclusive areas for recreational activities and social interaction. The sense of community that rooftop parks and gardens foster can strengthen urban resilience and support efforts to build more inclusive and equitable cities.  Rooftop parks and gardens offer a holistic solution to the problem of limited green spaces in urban areas by addressing environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and economic development. This innovative approach can lead to more resilient, inclusive, and livable cities that prioritize the well-being of their residents while promoting sustainable development goals.            5  3. Program Design and Implementation Plan:  The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program is a comprehensive initiative to enhance public health and well-being in urban areas by transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces. This program addresses the growing issue of limited green spaces in cities, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. The overarching goal is to improve physical and mental health outcomes among urban residents by constructing rooftop parks, engaging communities through awareness programs, and providing educational workshops on gardening and environmental sustainability. The first step in implementing this program involves conducting a thorough needs assessment to identify rooftops suitable for development. This step includes extensive surveys and consultations with property owners, local authorities, and community stakeholders to ensure that the rooftops meet structural and safety requirements. The needs assessment also gauges community support and confirms regulatory compliance. By selecting appropriate rooftops, the program provides its efforts to align with local building codes and address potential risks. Once the suitable rooftops are identified, the program moves into the design and planning phase, which involves creating detailed architectural and landscaping blueprints. This phase emphasizes safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. Collaborating with urban planners and landscape architects, the designs incorporate elements that support the program's goals while enhancing the visual appeal of the urban landscape. Following the design phase, the construction of the rooftop parks and gardens begins. This step involves preparing the rooftops, installing safety features, and constructing green spaces according to the approved plans. The program establishes clear timelines and milestones for construction, allowing for efficient project management. To ensure the longevity of the rooftop parks, a comprehensive maintenance plan is developed, involving community volunteers and local organizations to maintain the green spaces. Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the program's success. The program organizes various events and awareness campaigns to encourage community participation and foster a sense of ownership. Volunteer opportunities are created for the upkeep of the rooftop parks, and educational workshops on gardening and environmental practices are offered to promote sustainable behavior. This community-focused approach helps integrate the rooftop parks into the urban culture, turning them into valued assets. To mitigate potential problems, the program implements several vital strategies. Diverse funding sources are secured to ensure financial stability, while close collaboration with local authorities helps navigate regulatory challenges. The program also uses weather-resistant materials and adjusts construction timelines to accommodate adverse weather conditions. Extensive community outreach and education efforts are made to reduce resistance and build strong support for the program. Robust evaluation metrics are established to monitor the program's progress and success. These include indicators such as reported stress levels, surface temperatures, and the number of completed rooftop projects. These metrics provide a clear framework for assessing the program's impact and allow for timely adjustments to address any challenges during implementation. The Rooftop Parks and Gardens program aims to significantly improve public health and well-being in urban areas through a well-thought-out program design and a comprehensive implementation plan. By engaging the community 6  and addressing potential risks, the program creates sustainable and accessible green spaces that contribute to the overall resilience and quality of life in urban environments.

          "\"Urban areas often lack green spaces, which impacts residents' physical and mental health. The scarcity of parks and natural environments in densely populated cities contributes to increased stress, reduced physical activity, and diminished well-being.\"",
          "\"Our project proposes developing rooftop parks and gardens to address these issues, transforming underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces.\"",
          "\"Once appropriate rooftops are identified, the process will include assessing structural integrity, accessibility, and potential community needs.\""
        ],
        "analysis": "The paper titled \"Developing Innovative Green Spaces to Tackle Urban Health Risks\" is fundamentally relevant to the claim that urban green spaces enhance community well-being. It addresses a pressing concern in urbanized environments: the absence of adequate green spaces, which significantly impacts the physical and mental health of residents. The authors argue that urban parks and gardens can mitigate health risks prevalent in densely populated areas, thereby promoting overall community well-being. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: The central thesis of the paper is that the lack of green spaces in urban environments leads to negative health outcomes, including increased stress levels, reduced physical activity, and overall diminished well-being. The project's objective to transform underutilized rooftops into accessible green spaces speaks directly to the enhancement of community well-being through the introduction of nature in urban settings. The paper highlights the multifaceted benefits of green spaces, such as improvement in mental health and fostering social interaction among community members, which directly supports the claim about urban green spaces enhancing overall community well-being.\n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology proposed includes identifying suitable rooftops that can be transformed into green spaces, followed by assessments of structural integrity and accessibility, which is critical to ensuring safety and usability. Additionally, the emphasis on community needs shows a participatory approach, which likely enhances the project's acceptance and success. Though the paper does not provide quantitative data or metrics in this overview, it lays the groundwork for future empirical research. The planned assessments could lead to evidence-based conclusions regarding the positive impacts of these green spaces on community health, but absence of preliminary data does limit the current quality of evidence presented.\n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The significance of this proposal is paramount. By advocating for innovative solutions like rooftop gardens, the paper not only proposes revitalizing urban areas but also contributes to the discourse on sustainability and public health. The anticipated benefits, such as enhancing mental well-being and encouraging physical activities in a naturally appealing environment, mark a pivotal shift in urban planning paradigms. Furthermore, with urban populations growing, the need for such interventions becomes even more critical. Therefore, the significance also extends to policy implications, advocating for urban design that incorporates health-promoting features.\n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Nevertheless, the paper's limitations should not be overlooked. The reliance on rooftop spaces might not address broader systemic issues such as socioeconomic disparities in access to outdoor spaces. Additionally, the proposal may exhibit bias by focusing solely on innovative solutions without adequately considering the community's diverse needs or existing challenges faced by lower-income residents who may not benefit from such developments. This oversight could lead to unequal access to the anticipated benefits of these green spaces. Furthermore, there is an absence of a comparative analysis with other urban greening initiatives, which would have bolstered the argument for the effectiveness of rooftop gardens specifically. \n\nIn conclusion, this paper provides a well-founded proposal relevant to the enhancement of community well-being through urban green spaces, while also highlighting areas for further research and consideration to ensure broad and equitable community benefits.",

        "abstract": "The urban green infrastructure has been increasingly used for sustainable design and resilient cities. Despite its many benefits, such as aesthetic enhancement, improvement of the physical and mental health of residents, especially for vulnerable youth and elderly people, or creating opportunities for social cohesion and climate regulation, green infrastructure has not been used in low-income housing in subtropical Brazil, where the temperature can reach over 40 °C along the summer. This study evaluated a full-scale, low-cost green façade over a year to assess its effect on the thermal performance of an eco-friendly affordable housing located in humid subtropical climate. Aiming to be eco-friendly and keep its cost low, the house was built with materials such as unplastered hollow soil-cement bricks, not having very good thermal performance. The Wisteria floribunda, a deciduous vine, was used in the green façade installed on a west-facing wall, adjacent to a bare wall, which was also evaluated enabling to establish the thermal difference between the shaded wall and the bare wall. In the winter, the shaded and bare walls' amplitudes were remarkably close, due to leaf shedding, a desirable feature to improve temperatures within the house. The benefits of the green façade were clearer during spring and summer when the external surface temperature of the shaded wall was reduced by up to 9 °C compared to the bare wall, and its thermal amplitude varied by 8.4 °C, while the amplitude of the bare wall was more than double this value. The plant layer diminished the heat flux through the external wall by up to 22.3 W/m2 during the summer, and 8 W/m2 during the winter. These results show the potential of a low-cost green façade to improve the thermal comfort of green affordable housing projects.",

        "analysis": "The paper titled 'A year-assessment of the suitability of a green façade to improve thermal performance of an affordable housing' provides a relevant backdrop for understanding the impact of urban green spaces on community well-being, albeit indirectly. The core claim that 'urban green spaces enhance community well-being' can be looked at through the lens of thermal comfort and thermal performance, especially in affordable housing scenarios. Urban green spaces, including green façades, contribute to microclimate regulation, which influences air quality, temperature, and consequently, the physical comfort of residents. Improved thermal performance in buildings can reduce the need for artificial cooling, thus saving energy and associated costs, while enhancing living conditions in dense urban settings. \n\n1. **Direct Relevance to the Claim**: While the primary focus of the study is on thermal performance evaluation, there are significant implications for community well-being tied to these findings. A critical aspect of urban green spaces is their role in mitigating heat islands, which is crucial for maintaining livable urban environments. The study illustrates that a well-designed green façade can substantially decrease external wall temperatures, which translates to reduced indoor temperatures—enhancing the thermal comfort of occupants. This, in turn, can improve overall resident health and quality of life, aligning with the claim about urban green spaces enhancing community well-being, by contributing to more comfortable living conditions. \n\n2. **Methodology and Evidence Quality**: The methodology employed in the study involves a robust year-long assessment which captures seasonal variations in thermal performance, thereby adding depth to the conclusions drawn. The inclusion of comparative analysis between green façades and bare walls ensures that findings are reliable, minimizing biases that may arise from isolated observations. The utilization of numerical data to depict temperature differences (noting reductions of up to 9°C on the wall temperature) showcases objective evidence that supports the claim of improved thermal comfort. However, the specific context of affordable housing and green façades may limit broader generalizability regarding all urban green spaces. The evidence presented is thorough, with multiple measurements and statistical evaluations strengthening the claim's viability. \n\n3. **Significance of Findings**: The findings indicate a substantial potential for cost-effective green façades to improve thermal comfort, which is a critical element of housing quality, especially in densely populated urban areas. By showcasing that greening strategies can yield measurable environmental benefits, these findings advocate for urban planning policies that prioritize the introduction and implementation of green spaces. This study elucidates a viable pathway for enhancing community well-being through urban greening initiatives, which is increasingly critical in light of rising urban temperatures due to climate change. Furthermore, the focus on affordable housing underscores the intersection of environmental quality and socioeconomic equity, amplifying the relevance of these results in broader policy discussions. \n\n4. **Limitations and Potential Biases**: Despite its strengths, the paper acknowledges certain limitations, including the singular focus on thermal performance without exploring other potential benefits of green façades, such as psychological impacts or biodiversity enhancement, which are integral to comprehensively establishing their role in community well-being. Moreover, the study is confined to a specific location and set of building characteristics, which might inject location-based biases into the findings. Therefore, while the study does present a compelling argument for the benefits of green façades in thermal comfort, further research would be beneficial to probe wider aspects of well-being beyond thermal performance alone. Overall, this paper plays an essential role in paving the way for integrated urban planning, focusing on how sustainable practices can create healthier, more liveable community spaces.",
