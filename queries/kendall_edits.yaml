      1. This request is ONLY about IoT-based solutions for precision irrigation
         scheduling in agriculture. Papers must explicitly mention using IoT
         (or sensor networks) for water/irrigation management of crops.
      2. Highest rank if the paper describes a real or pilot-scale deployment in actual
         agricultural settings (field or greenhouse) with measured outcomes (e.g., water saved).
      3. Mid-rank if the system is described with partial implementation or simulations, 
         but still specifically for irrigation scheduling in agriculture.
      4. Irrelevant or extremely low rank if IoT is used for something else (like pest control,
         greenhouse climate monitoring with no mention of irrigation scheduling, or a different domain).
      5. Prefer studies that report numeric metrics (water-use reduction, yield changes, or 
         cost feasibility). If no performance data is provided, rank it lower.
      6. Real commercial-scale or multi-farm scale IoT deployments rank at the top. 
      7. Must mention agriculture or crop irrigation—purely theoretical frameworks or 
         environmental IoT not controlling irrigation are bottom-ranked.

      1. We only want fuzzy logic solutions for irrigation scheduling in agriculture.
         If a paper does not explicitly confirm it applies fuzzy logic to 
         agricultural water management or irrigation scheduling, it must go low or 
         be excluded.
      2. Top rank if it involves real-world or pilot-scale demonstration with 
         crops, specifying membership functions, rule sets, or performance metrics 
         like water savings or yield changes.
      3. Studies that compare fuzzy-based irrigation with other scheduling methods 
         (e.g., threshold-based, ET-based, or PID) and present quantitative results 
         rank higher.
      4. If it's purely conceptual with no performance data or no mention 
         of actual irrigation scheduling, rank it low.
      5. Must mention "fuzzy logic" or "fuzzy inference" plus "irrigation" 
         or "water scheduling" for an agricultural crop. If it’s fuzzy logic 
         for pest control or fertilization only, rank near bottom.
      6. The more detail on membership functions, rules, or 
         fuzzy system design, the higher. 
      7. Large-scale or greenhouse-scale with real data outranks 
         small-lab or purely simulated contexts.

    ranking_guidance: >
      1. Papers must explicitly mention both CWSI (canopy temperature-based) 
         AND SWSI (soil moisture-based) used together or in comparison for irrigation scheduling.
      2. Highest rank if there's a real farm or greenhouse scenario with 
         actual sensor data, specifying how both indices are computed 
         and how they drive irrigation decisions.
      3. Studies only discussing canopy temperature but not SWSI 
         OR only discussing soil water stress index without canopy measurement 
         can rank if they mention irrigation scheduling, but are lower priority 
         than those integrating both.
      4. Must reference actual crop water management or scheduling 
         of irrigation. If it’s purely theoretical or a different domain 
         (like industrial or orchard cooling not related to water management), rank low.
      5. Numeric performance metrics or outcomes (water-use reduction, yield improvements) 
         are crucial for top ranking.
      6. Must be about agriculture. If they measure canopy temperature for non-agricultural 
         contexts, that’s out.
      7. Large-scale or multi-season field data is top tier. 
         Single-lab or purely model-based with no real crop is mid-tier at best.

    ranking_guidance: >
      1. We only want machine learning approaches applied specifically 
         to irrigation scheduling or water management in agriculture.
      2. Must mention a real dataset or actual field data used to train 
         or validate the ML model, or a large historical dataset for a real crop scenario.
      3. High priority if the paper compares multiple ML methods (RF, ANN, CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, etc.) 
         with numeric performance or water savings. 
      4. If it's purely hypothetical ML with no actual application in irrigation, rank low.
      5. Must explicitly mention controlling or guiding irrigation amounts/frequency 
         or some direct scheduling aspect. If it’s ML to predict yield 
         with no tie to irrigation decisions, rank it lower.
      6. Real-world or pilot-scale in farmland outranks greenhouse or purely simulated data. 
         However, greenhouse is still relevant if they mention actual irrigation scheduling for plants.
      7. Prefer papers with quantifiable improvements: water saved, yield gain, cost reduction.

    ranking_guidance: >
      1. We want truly integrated or hybrid approaches for irrigation scheduling, 
         meaning at least two advanced techniques together (e.g. IoT + ML, IoT + fuzzy, 
         or canopy + soil sensor + advanced logic).
      2. Papers must explicitly mention scheduling or controlling irrigation in 
         an agricultural setting (crops in fields or greenhouses). 
         If it’s just a conceptual multi-method design with no mention of actual irrigation, rank low.
      3. Highest rank if real or pilot-scale data is used, with sensors and at least 
         one advanced algorithm (fuzzy logic or ML) actually implemented.
      4. Mid-rank if it’s partial: e.g., they have IoT + fuzzy but only a lab test 
         or purely theoretical. They still mention “irrigation scheduling,” so keep them but lower.
      5. Must provide some performance or validation metric: water savings, yield, cost, 
         or at least a measured accuracy. If no results at all, rank near bottom.
      6. If they use CWSI + SWSI or multi-sensor data plus an advanced approach (fuzzy or ML), 
         that is prime. 
      7. Hard exclude or bottom rank if the paper merges advanced methods but 
         not for irrigation scheduling (like ML + fuzzy for livestock feeding or orchard pest control).
